WEBVTT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.250
He was all right at night.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.417
He even got up and
went to the bathroom.

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:39.792
What happened, boss?

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.458
Someone's dead.
- Who?

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.375
That same guy who used to
fight with the newspaper..

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:45.125
..vendor every morning,
he has a daughter..

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.875
..who has a healthy figure,
she's not to be seen today?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.542
He was very close to Mr. Chopra.

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.125
He used to buy fruits for Rs.30..

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:51.625
..and he used to complain
about it 300 times.

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:55.125
Oh, God, we
shouldn't criticise the dead.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.958
Who criticises when alive?
This is the best opportunity.

00:02:58.042 --> 00:02:59.458
Who'll get the seed now?

00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:05.125
Everything is by God's grace,
Sister, the bill. - Rs.120??

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:07.458
20 and 20 makes 40 and..
Okay, now that he isn't alive..

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:08.875
..doesn't mean you
could give any calculation.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:10.542
Do you know?
He used to keep an account..

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.125
..of each and everything
on the Chinese calculator.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:14.875
Mummy, is it matching?

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.458
Dear, at least today you should have
worn a traditional dress, isn't it?

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:20.042
Mummy, this Sunday there are
many dead bodies coming at..

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.375
..the hill, and so there
would be many people too..

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:22.708
..coming there, I can't wear
a traditional suit there.

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:25.125
Is he going to be alive again
if she wears a traditional dress?

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:27.042
Look, I am telling you
nothing has happened.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.042
Nothing happened? I have to
cook food for so many people..

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.958
..it's eleven o'clock.
Nothing has been done yet?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.917
I say cook some kidney
beans and rice.

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:36.542
Instead of two, cook it
till it whistles four times.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:40.208
And add a bit of soda to it.
It will cook faster. Simple.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:41.833
Kidney beans and rice?

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.583
The kidney beans spoon was in one
hand and the remote in the other.

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:46.750
Is that all?

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:47.917
Sachin's sixer.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.917
Okay, but what happened
to Khosla sir?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.750
We have no idea,
Uncle. He's never told us..

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:53.750
..what he is up to.. soon
after watching the match..

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.417
..we saw him fallen
on the sofa itself.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.250
This watch of yours is nice.
Is it an imported one?

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:02.083
I too was thinking of buying one.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.917
Hey, dear Bunty, how are you?
- I am fine, Uncle. How are you?

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.000
How much is it for, Uncle?
- Maybe Rs.3700.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.667
He was my companion for eight
years in the chartered bus..

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.083
..and was thinking
of buying some plot.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:17.250
Let's see who sits next to me
henceforth in the adjoining seat.

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:20.125
Cherry, have you made
arrangements for some tea?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.500
No idea, Uncle, you may
please have a look yourself.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.083
Mummy.. Mummy
where are the car keys?

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:25.000
Dear, it must be in his pocket..

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.083
..he had got the car
reversed for you last night.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.458
He had to die with
the keys in his pocket.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.125
I'll be late from the office in
the evening, got a presentation. Bye.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.792
No problem
- The boy is very busy..

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.958
..he is the apple of
Khosla sir's eye.

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:42.042
This picture has been made
very well by her, isn't it?

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.792
It is from the passport.

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:49.292
He was to go to Bangladesh.
He couldn't even go there.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.167
You too, early in the morning.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:26.500
I've been requesting you from
the last 30 years not to give me..

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:31.000
..kidney beans at night, see
I've ended with a gas problem..

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.208
..and I have to visit the plot too.

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:37.333
Oh, you have to go to
the plot at 9 o'clock..

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:39.750
..but you have woken up at
five in the morning itself.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.833
Neither do you sleep nor do
you allow others to sleep.

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:46.333
Why should I allow
everyone to sleep?

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.000
You must be making preparations
to move to the new plot.

00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:42.250
Mr. Khosla, now you
people will be known..

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:43.750
..as the family from South Delhi.

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:45.667
Your family must be
very excited, isn't it?

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:48.917
We are going for the very first time.
We will be going at two.

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:51.208
Lucky man.

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:56.917
Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe,
inhale again.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.292
Now start..

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:19.500
Again a deep breath, inhale..

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:27.958
What happened?

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:29.875
Cherry was saying,
he won't go to see the plot.

00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:33.208
Why? The whole family is going.

00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:34.708
Is he a big joint
secretary that he is refusing?

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:35.875
You ask him about that.

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.458
Why should I ask him? Is he
doing any favour to me by coming?

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.708
Mr. Khosla, please concentrate.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.250
Let him not come
if he is not coming.

00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:50.167
Why should I spoil my
Sunday because of others?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.208
I will also not go, no one will go.

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:09.875
Once this gate opens,
there's a garden in front.

00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.208
Okay? And in front of the garden
like this the stairs are going..

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.125
..and from there when you go ahead..

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.167
The house is yet to be made and
the thieves have already come..

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.667
..yes, then, in front of the
garden will be our drawing room.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.833
What should I do with this?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.333
Pick it up and throw it out.

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:28.583
Please concentrate a bit,
you are the engineer..

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:31.833
..of the full house, you are
going to construct it, look here.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.000
Papa, I'm a computer engineer.

00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:37.750
I don't know about these bricks and
stones, I'm watching, you continue.

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:41.000
Okay. I'll explain to you the
meaning of south facing plot.

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:42.417
But from here, where
does the south fall?

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.833
Just make him understand.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:45.000
There.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.750
And from our present house?

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:48.667
From there too it is over there.

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:50.750
Oh! Then why have we taken the land..

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:51.917
..thirty kilometers far from there?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.417
Where are you going there?
- Two minutes, Papa.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.667
Afterwards you play with that..
What I mean is..

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.667
He's not playing,
he's reading a message.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.833
Papa, I'm telling you, you're
becoming illiterate day-by-day.

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:02.208
Papa, I have to leave.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.250
Leave! Where to?

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.417
I have to go to office.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.583
Go to office? On Sunday?

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:10.583
I know you work for a
multinational company..

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.917
..but Sunday is for every country.
Tell them it's a holiday.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.917
No, Papa, I'll have
to go. I'm leaving.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:17.875
We have to decide everything..

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958
..what marble is to be put on
the floor and for the walls..

00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:22.875
You all decide that,
I'm getting late.

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958
Come on! We'll have to discuss
about your floor with you only.

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.375
Papa, whatever floor you'll decide,
I'll stay in that..

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:27.625
..but now I'll have to go.

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.042
Bunty, drop me.

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:30.208
He doesn't have time
even on a Sunday.

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.042
The company people are
draining his blood. Poor thing.

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:39.125
Three parties were interested
for this property, Uncle.

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.375
One had even given
the money in cash..

00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:43.625
..but I withdrew it in-between,
isn't it?

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:46.958
Dear, hard work has to done.

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:48.125
Yes, yes.

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:51.500
Vijender, frankly speaking,
I have spent all my life's earning..

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:54.417
..in this.. this location.

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:56.458
The main thing is that
my younger son Cherry's office..

00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:58.542
..is very close to this place.
- Yes, yes.

00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:04.625
These multinational companies
catch the intelligent persons..

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.458
Uncle, you've
brought the cash, isn't it?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.417
Cash?
- Cash.. - Oh..

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:10.500
Actually, Cherry
used to look after it.

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:12.167
But he works even on a Sunday.

00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:14.167
Cash is there.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.333
Thirty-two, thirty-two,
thirty-two, thirty-three..

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:18.333
..thirty-three, thirty-three,
thirty-four, thirty-four..

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:23.125
Vijender, count carefully,
it's my whole life's earning.

00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:28.667
Don't bother, Uncle, it's my
daily job, thirty-four, thirty..

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.833
..four, thirty-five..
Take this, it's complete now.

00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:37.333
Congratulations, Uncle.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.833
And Uncle, when are you
constructing your house?

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.667
Dear, I have done my job,
now who wants to stay there..

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.667
..let them worry.
I told my younger son Cherry..

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.000
..what we say in English
that it's your baby now?

00:11:01.792 --> 00:11:03.458
Now, can we go?

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:04.875
Now my sons will take it further.

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.750
Yes, yes, what are the sons for?

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:18.167
Meghna? Meghna?

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.458
Meghna?

00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:33.792
Hi, Bill Gates.

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:35.625
Hey, what are you doing?

00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:36.792
JLT.

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:37.958
What?

00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:39.125
Just like that.

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:40.708
Sometimes you should do like this.
It's good for health.

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:42.625
Will you try? Should I teach you?

00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:44.125
No, thank you.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.708
Cherry, why you are so boring?

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:49.625
Okay. Come here,
come on, hold the leg.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.208
Hold me! Hold me!

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.708
Oh, God, look at your face.

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:08.625
Don't worry, I am not going
to kiss you. Shall we move?

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:10.125
Shall we go for the rehearsal?

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:18.500
"She doesn't know.."

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:20.417
"..what she thinks.."

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.417
"No heads, no tails,
where does she come from?"

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.000
"She is unusual.”

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.833
"She is very interesting.."

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:33.250
Okay. Come, hold me.

00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:35.000
Why?

00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:36.250
Hey, what happened? Just hold me.

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:38.000
But why?

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:39.667
Because you are my boyfriend.

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:42.500
Now just hold me. - Please,
I am not anyone's boyfriend.

00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:43.667
Okay, fine, you're not..

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.750
Now just hold me! Otherwise
you will fall.. like this.

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:53.000
"I do I trust her, wait for
her and have confidence in her.."

00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:13.042
And Bill Gates, celebrating Sunday?

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.792
Hey! Leave it.

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:15.958
What?

00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:17.125
I told you to stop smoking,
isn't it?

00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:24.208
She knows I can't refuse, she is
taking disadvantage of the same.

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:25.792
Yes, I do, leave it.
- Take this too.

00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:27.208
Thank you!

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:32.417
Next month there is
Bangalore theatre festival..

00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:34.125
..will you come along with us?

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.750
There is a problem
for next month, Bapu.

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.667
She is working too hard, give
her moral support by coming.

00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:43.250
This coward will give
me moral support? This?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.333
Take a leave for two days, dear.

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:46.667
It's not about leave, Bapu.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.833
Actually I won't be here
at that time.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:50.167
Then where will you be?

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.333
New York.

00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:54.333
New York? Wow! On tour?

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.833
No, I had applied to
a software company..

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:02.000
..if everything goes well, then
from next month, I have to join.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.000
How come you never told me?

00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:08.250
You two really keep
it close, don't you?

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.167
Anyway, very good, I will
always wish you to be successful..

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.583
..keep climbing higher..

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.000
..but don't forget us
after reaching there.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.000
Don't be stupid, Bapu,
how can someone forget you.

00:14:20.917 --> 00:14:22.000
She will forget.. Yes.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.833
Bapu!
- What is it?

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.833
There was a call from Bangalore.

00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:29.000
They were asking about
the next month's show.

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:30.167
New York, is it?

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:34.750
Actually I thought, it
wouldn't be right telling anyone..

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.125
..before things get finalised.

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:42.750
What's the use of telling someone?

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:47.500
Everybody at home would be happy.

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:48.917
Their son is going to be an NRI!

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.417
You didn't tell at home?

00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:04.167
Cherry, you are going away..

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.667
..and you didn't inform
at your home. Are you mad?

00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:13.875
Meghna, you know how my papa is,
I just don't know how to tell him.

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:21.625
Why, what's the problem? The
way you told me, tell him too..

00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:27.625
"I am afraid, is this a dream.."

00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:34.375
"The one who is mine, don't
know where he will be tomorrow."

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:44.083
Hello.
- Where are you, sir?

00:15:45.417 --> 00:15:48.083
The queue is about to finish.
Where are you?

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:49.250
I was about to leave, Asif.

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:51.083
Igbal. Asif Igbal. Do one thing..

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:53.583
..get one photo and
come here immediately.

00:15:53.917 --> 00:15:55.750
But you said, six will do.

00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:58.083
If the US embassy did
what I wished..

00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:00.583
..then whole Karol
Bagh would be California!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.583
Everything will be
closed after 1 o'clock..

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:04.583
..and they are
closed for one week then.

00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:07.208
And then these guys
will be in a war then..

00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:08.792
..and you will be
sitting here forever.

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.958
If you want a VISA in 30 days, then
come with a photo in ten minutes.

00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:14.625
See you.
- But.. Asif!

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:38.458
You are right on time!

00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:41.000
Looks like you will
reach America on time too.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:43.042
These are the papers
you asked for the visa.

00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:50.833
Will you have tea?
- No, thank you.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.333
There! You messed up!

00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:02.875
Mixed your name with
your dad's in the hurry.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.583
No, it is the way it is.

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:09.750
What does it mean?

00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:13.500
You mean that your dad's
name is Kamal Kishore Khosla..

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:15.333
..and your name is
Chiraunjee Lal Khosla?

00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:20.583
Chiraunjee Lal?

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:26.083
To think what they are going
to do to your name in America!

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:27.250
You check the papers!

00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:29.917
Chiraunjee! Isn't it
something that is to be eaten?

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:36.167
Whoever has named you,
surely, he must be your enemy.

00:17:37.167 --> 00:17:40.250
Brother Cherry, Papa is here.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.083
Cherry, come here.
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:45.333
All the decisions are
waiting for your arrival.

00:17:45.917 --> 00:17:48.417
Where is the name-plate, Bunty?
- It's in your lap!

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:52.250
This is the nameplate. Look at it.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.083
Well, here it is.
K.K. and Sudha Khosla..

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:55.250
..that is me and your mother.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.500
This is B.K Khosla. That is Bunty.

00:17:57.583 --> 00:18:01.250
And this Chiraunjee Khosla,
that is you. - How is it?

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.750
I told you not to make it in gold..

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:13.833
..these cheap things are
not liked by all, Bunty.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.583
We will redo it in marble.
But the names look good, don't they?

00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:24.542
Papa, this will change.
- This will change.. what?

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:27.792
Papa, I am changing my name.

00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:29.875
Changing your name?
What do you mean?

00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.042
I didn't understand.

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:33.208
I am changing my name.

00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:34.792
He has just come from the office.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.375
And you are discussing the
name-plate. Here, drink water.

00:18:38.792 --> 00:18:42.292
Water? Let him drink water.
But I did not understand.

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:45.625
Papa, I don't want to be
named Chiraunjee Lal Khosla.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.167
Why?
- Because I don't like this name!

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.417
You don't like it? It is your name.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.417
There is no question
of like and dislike!

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.917
Because.. You won't understand, papa.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Sit down for a minute!
You aren't drunk, are you?

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.542
You are the limit. If he
wishes to say something, listen!

00:19:04.083 --> 00:19:08.667
Listen to him? Today he
says I am changing my name!

00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:10.333
Then he'll want to change his home!

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:11.750
Then he will want to
change his family!

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:12.917
And you are speaking for him!

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.167
What's there to speak for, Papa?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.833
I just want to change my name,
what's so great in it?

00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:21.125
Okay. Okay. You don't change
your name, you just shorten it.

00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:22.708
C.L. Khosla?

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:24.792
This is fine, you get to keep
your name, and also the change!

00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:29.042
I don't wish to shorten my name,
I wish to change it.

00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:33.875
But what is wrong with a short name?

00:19:34.292 --> 00:19:35.375
Take mine for instance.

00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:37.375
K.K. Khosla, short for
Kamal Kishore Khosla.

00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:39.875
Papa, you look like Kamal
Kishore from head to toe.

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.458
But do I look
Chiraunjee Lal from any angle?

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:46.458
Let me suggest,
Hrithik is a hit these days.

00:19:46.542 --> 00:19:47.625
You name yourself Hrithik.

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:48.792
No, no. Vivek.

00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:54.708
Talk softly. By the way,
how will Yuvraj be?

00:19:55.417 --> 00:19:57.167
These sportsmen aren't
safe to be named after.

00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:00.750
He stops scoring runs, and
this guy will be kicked.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.417
Why don't you take up
an English name?

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.500
That really
impresses folks these days.

00:20:06.583 --> 00:20:08.417
What?
- Like Ricky Martin?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.917
Yes. Ricky Martin. That's good.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:16.250
Talk softly..
- Which was the other one, tell me.

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:18.417
"Living La Vida Loca."
(Live life the crazy way).

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:30.708
Mr. Khosla. What
difference does a name make?

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:33.292
Even if he changes name,
he will remain your son!

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:36.917
Actually, Chiraunjee
Lal sounds like a..

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.583
..Street peddler than
a software engineer.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.083
These guys nowadays think
in a multi-national manner.

00:20:45.417 --> 00:20:50.250
They don't like these Indian names,
to them it is a bad joke!

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.000
He was named Chiraunjee
Lal by my mother, Sahani sir.

00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:55.917
You know how they used
to name kids those days.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.333
Now, the mother is no more.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.250
She won't come back and
check if the name is changed!

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:05.333
You change it. Don't
take cudgels with youth.

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.833
You need to compromise
with him. Compromise!

00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:09.000
Compromise?

00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:11.833
The whole country is
running because of compromise.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:18.875
Just compromise a bit,
it will insure your old age.

00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.750
I don't need insurance, Sahani sir!

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:24.833
You know how the elder
one turned out? - I know.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.500
I have high hopes
from this second one.

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.917
That's why I am saying,
make friends with him.

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:31.833
Sahani sir, how can I
make friends with a boy..

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:34.667
..who does not like his own name?

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.792
You want to teach me, how to
make friends with a young son?

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:43.833
What do you want, Brother? What?

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.417
What? Yes, you tell me.
You move aside!

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.250
I have heard, that first you
put the ice, then the soda..

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:31.333
..and then the whisky.

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:37.000
No. You pour the whisky first..
then ice.. and then soda.

00:22:38.042 --> 00:22:42.208
No, first, you put the ice, that's
why they call it 'on-the-rocks.'

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:46.458
Then do it your own way.
- Buddy, why are you being touchy?

00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:54.083
You go get some Coke
for yourself and mummy.

00:22:54.292 --> 00:22:57.167
Why Coke? Can't we drink 'Whisky'?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.000
Sudha, call her to the kitchen.

00:22:59.083 --> 00:23:01.833
Sudha, there is no need of
calling me to the kitchen.

00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:03.000
You also come here and have a drink!

00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:04.583
You can fry the snacks later!

00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:11.042
Okay, Okay. Granted. Go
ahead and have your drinks.

00:23:26.917 --> 00:23:28.833
Shall we start?
- Slowly.

00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:31.708
These things should be
enjoyed slowly.

00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:35.875
I have seen Sahani sir
while drinking. Slowly.

00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.958
It's called, 'Hold The Drink.'

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.000
Now, shall we start?
- Buddy, let Cherry come!

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:49.750
Doesn't he late? Check out,
if he is waiting outside.

00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:51.500
Why should he be waiting outside?

00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:52.833
You just go and look, please.

00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:56.250
Start drinking please.
You are already irritated.

00:23:58.417 --> 00:24:00.667
Look. You have a long
life ahead. He has come.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.833
Come here, Cherry.
Start frying the snacks.

00:24:02.917 --> 00:24:04.000
Cherry has arrived.

00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:09.292
Aren't you a bit late today?

00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:12.042
No, Papa. This is
when I come every day.

00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:13.708
Papa has thrown a party
for the plot!

00:24:13.792 --> 00:24:15.208
Let's have that list of names,
Bunty.. you're..

00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:20.125
We couldn't finish the
discussion of your name that day.

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.125
I have tried changing it.

00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:25.125
Chiraunjee Lal could
be Chiraunjee Kumar.

00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:27.125
But no. This is a good name.

00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:28.292
Chandan Kumar(Sandalwood).

00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:32.667
Then there is Chanakya Kumar,
Chanchal Kumar..

00:24:32.792 --> 00:24:34.708
Papa, I need to check my e-mails..

00:24:34.792 --> 00:24:37.708
Buddy, you work so hard.
Also try to celebrate..

00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:40.292
Is the drink ready?
Come, lets start.

00:24:40.708 --> 00:24:44.042
Take it. Three cheers for
the new Khosla Kunj (abode).

00:24:44.125 --> 00:24:47.750
Plot no. 32, New Sapna Vihar. Cheers!

00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:54.542
What happened?
- Papa, I don't drink this drink.

00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:59.375
Then what do you drink? Beer?
Bunty, go get beer.

00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:03.167
Papa, I don't drink.
- You don't drink?

00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:06.583
No mater, come, have one drink
with us for good time's sake.

00:25:06.917 --> 00:25:08.833
By the way, too much
drinking is not good, Bunty.

00:25:08.917 --> 00:25:11.667
Papa, when I said
I don't drink, I mean it!

00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:17.083
Do you think we are fools here,
that we are drinking?

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.417
Is Mr. Sahani a fool, that
he drinks every evening?

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:23.500
Is the whole world a bunch of drunks,
and you alone are wise?

00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:25.167
What are you doing?

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.333
What am I doing? I am trying to
have a drink with my young son.

00:25:28.417 --> 00:25:31.333
But he is feeling ashamed to
drink with me, don't I understand?

00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:33.833
You go inside.
- He won't go. I need to talk to him.

00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:35.417
What is there to talk about?
- There are 100 things.

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.750
A new home is being built,
there are 100 things to do, to plan.

00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:39.708
I don't want to do any planning!

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.625
No! You have to! If you
wish to stay in this home..

00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:43.417
..you have to do what
everything is doing!

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.125
I don't want to live in this house.
- Shut up. - Why?

00:25:45.208 --> 00:25:46.458
Are the multinationals
giving you a big mansion?

00:25:46.542 --> 00:25:47.625
Or is this house not worthy of you?

00:25:47.708 --> 00:25:48.792
Papa, I am going.
- Where are you going?

00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:50.625
I am going to America!
- He is going to America?

00:25:50.792 --> 00:25:52.208
I've got a job there.

00:25:52.292 --> 00:25:53.542
How can you go to America?
It is not an easy thing!

00:25:53.792 --> 00:25:55.375
Papa, I've got a job there.

00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:56.958
Stop dreaming big,
and stay grounded.

00:25:57.042 --> 00:25:58.125
Papa, I have got a job there!

00:25:58.292 --> 00:25:59.542
Watch out for what you have.
Or you will lose that too!

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:02.000
You will fall so hard that you
will lose that big mouth of yours!

00:26:02.042 --> 00:26:03.583
Take care for what you have!

00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:05.583
And who is waiting to roll
out a red carpet for you there?

00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:07.583
Papa, I have got a job in America.

00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:23.875
I had applied to a company.

00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:30.208
They have appointed me. I
have to leave in a month.

00:26:33.583 --> 00:26:35.417
And what about your floor?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.083
There's Bunty.

00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:29.917
Brother, can I come in?

00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:36.000
Milk.

00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:48.292
When are you going to America?

00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:59.208
I have applied now.
The interview has to be given.

00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:02.917
Your interview will be nice.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.833
You will be visiting
during vacations, right?

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:27.042
Hey, are you sleeping?
- No. I am dancing.

00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:30.292
Dude, why are you taking
out papa's anger on me?

00:28:33.958 --> 00:28:35.042
Are you really going to America?

00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:41.708
You made it, dude.
Call us sometime too.

00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:43.458
Let me go first.

00:28:43.917 --> 00:28:46.208
I thought of applying in advance.

00:28:50.417 --> 00:28:51.833
How are your shares doing?

00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:54.333
Same as old.

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:59.667
I am planning to get into real
estate once the house is finished.

00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.333
‘Khosla Estate Agency.'

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:07.417
What do you say?
- Check it out.

00:29:16.417 --> 00:29:19.042
Get some sleep. I have some left.

00:29:24.875 --> 00:29:28.042
Dude! Don't forget
after going to America.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.417
Shall I serve the dinner?

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.333
No, Mama.

00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:49.500
You didn't tell before.

00:29:52.083 --> 00:29:53.167
I was about to, Mama.

00:29:54.917 --> 00:29:56.458
Your current job is not okay?

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.500
No, Mama, it's not that.
But I cant do with just ‘okay'.

00:30:03.792 --> 00:30:05.542
You all can join me in a few years.

00:30:06.292 --> 00:30:08.458
What will we do there at this age?

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:10.000
What are you doing here?

00:30:11.292 --> 00:30:12.958
Your papa is building a new house.

00:30:13.042 --> 00:30:15.375
What is the need?
For all this fuss, mess?

00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:18.833
He is thinking about your needs.

00:30:19.917 --> 00:30:21.000
There should be a big house.

00:30:21.417 --> 00:30:22.917
Everyone has own independent room.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.083
Even I am..

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.583
Forget it. You are
here for a month more.

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:40.542
Tomorrow is the consecration.
Don't refuse..

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.083
Papa will feel
better if you come along.

00:31:04.083 --> 00:31:07.917
"The thing that you planned,
the world does not agree.”

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.917
"The dream is not there anymore."

00:31:11.583 --> 00:31:15.000
"You kept laughing,
never knew any sorrow."

00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:17.917
"But no one remains your own now."

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.833
"Understand gradually,
know this world."

00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:26.750
"Something can be done even now."
- Right.

00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:30.500
"Something can be done even now."

00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:33.417
"What will I do now, Buddy?"

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:35.583
"Where will you go?"

00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:40.500
"What will I do now, Buddy?"

00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:45.792
I don't know where we are going?

00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:47.458
Stop. Stop for a minute.

00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:50.042
Go back, buddy.

00:31:53.292 --> 00:31:54.792
Litte reverse please

00:31:55.417 --> 00:32:00.250
Hold it! Last time
we came here.Right.

00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:06.208
All the plots appear the same.

00:32:07.375 --> 00:32:08.458
Where is the south?

00:32:08.542 --> 00:32:10.958
This is the same place.
Look, the board.

00:32:11.042 --> 00:32:13.333
Yes, I had also seen the board.

00:32:21.917 --> 00:32:23.125
But how come there is a wall here?

00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:28.000
It's written "Do not pee here."

00:32:28.917 --> 00:32:31.000
Have we come to pee here?

00:32:31.542 --> 00:32:33.750
I think we have come
to a different sector.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.083
This way the whole day
will pass away.

00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:40.417
Can't we ask someone?

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:44.208
Hello. Hello.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.333
Is anyone here?

00:32:50.792 --> 00:32:51.875
What is it?

00:32:52.042 --> 00:32:56.417
Buddy, sector 30.. plot number..
- 32.

00:32:56.625 --> 00:32:59.042
What?
- Where would plot number 32 be?

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.333
It is this same here.

00:33:01.833 --> 00:33:04.000
Sector 30, plot number
32 is this same one?

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:06.917
I told you it is this.
By the way, what do you want?

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.500
What do you mean what we want?
This plot belongs to us!

00:33:10.792 --> 00:33:11.917
And who are you?
- What?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.583
Hey, who are you?
- I am the watchman.

00:33:15.083 --> 00:33:18.000
Your plot? This plot belongs to
our Khurana sir.

00:33:18.167 --> 00:33:20.417
Which Khurana sir? Who?
- What is going on here?

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.167
He is the owner of
this plot, who else?

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.833
You watch your mouth or..
- Sir, why are you fighting with me?

00:33:25.083 --> 00:33:26.667
What's going on here?
- You talk to Mr. Khurana.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.000
Where will we find him?

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.667
I don't know that.
He comes over once a while.

00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:32.875
You..
- Wait, wait.

00:33:34.792 --> 00:33:38.417
Let's go to Vijender, seems like
a confusion. He only can tell us.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.708
Shall I wait or leave?
- You keep sitting behind.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Two minutes and he
wants to catch a flight.

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:48.375
Where is this Vijender?

00:33:49.042 --> 00:33:52.917
Uncle, how do I know who Khurana is?

00:33:53.833 --> 00:33:55.000
What is this, Vijender?

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:58.292
We bought the plot from you,
and you are saying you don't know?

00:33:59.042 --> 00:34:01.125
Uncle, there are thousands of plots.

00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:03.208
You can't expect me to keep tabs on
who is building a wall on which plot.

00:34:03.292 --> 00:34:04.625
How can I know?
- Why?

00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:08.292
Once you receive the money,
your responsibility is over?

00:34:08.708 --> 00:34:11.125
Aunt..
- Forget aunt, speak to me!

00:34:11.208 --> 00:34:13.042
That day you were
banging away counting the cash!

00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:14.542
Politely tell us what the
matter is, otherwise we have..

00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:16.250
..other means to get
the truth out of you.

00:34:18.292 --> 00:34:21.625
Uncle, the plot is in your name?
- Yes!

00:34:22.833 --> 00:34:23.917
Are the documents in your name?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.625
The documents are there,
that is why..

00:34:25.833 --> 00:34:28.750
You had taken the
possession by checking yourself?

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:30.083
What do you mean by taken?

00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.500
You had given us yourself.

00:34:33.792 --> 00:34:36.458
Uncle, then my job is done,
isn't it?

00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:40.458
It is your plot of land,
so you will look after it.

00:34:40.542 --> 00:34:41.625
But you..

00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:43.000
Uncle, please forgive me,
it is my lunchtime.

00:34:43.375 --> 00:34:44.458
If you need any
other help, let me know.

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:49.000
As it is you, have other
means too, you can try them.

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:51.667
Hey, come out!

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.375
Hey, watchman! Come out!
Wait and watch.

00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:04.792
Hey watchman! Open
the gate and come out.

00:35:08.333 --> 00:35:11.125
What is the matter, sir?
Why are you shouting so much?

00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:14.750
Brother, there was a watchman here..

00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:16.250
..where did he go?
- No!

00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:18.250
There is no watchman here!
Only I am here.

00:35:18.292 --> 00:35:20.333
You tell me, what is the matter?

00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:23.292
One minute! Look here, sir,
we do not have any enmity..

00:35:23.375 --> 00:35:26.042
..against you, but what
I wanted to say is that..

00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:27.292
Oh, Uncle, by having
enmity with me..

00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:28.750
..are you going to thrash me?

00:35:29.792 --> 00:35:32.042
Listen to me!
Just go back two steps.

00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:34.375
Go back! Go!

00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:37.583
Brother, I would like to
make a request to you.

00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:40.167
This plot is mine,
on which at the moment, you..

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.250
Brother, if this plot
would have been yours..

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.458
..then you would be
standing here in my place.

00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:46.417
And I would have been
standing in your place.

00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:47.667
Understood!

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:51.375
This plot belongs to Khurana sir.
- What? - Yes!

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.750
My Brother, you may
find him anywhere else..

00:36:02.833 --> 00:36:03.917
..but he is not here. Understood?!

00:36:05.292 --> 00:36:06.375
Who are you?

00:36:07.167 --> 00:36:09.167
I am your uncle, Ombir!

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.333
Now tell me what are you
going to do?

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.333
Brother, when we are
telling you that..

00:36:13.417 --> 00:36:17.042
Hey, Uncle, when I do not want
to listen to you..

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.792
..what is the use of talking?

00:36:19.917 --> 00:36:21.500
You will understand only
when your hands and legs will..

00:36:21.583 --> 00:36:24.292
..be broken in front
of these ladies, is it?

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.167
"What shall we do now?"

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.875
"Where shall we go now?"

00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:40.875
"What shall we do,
what shall we do now, my Brother?!"

00:36:41.417 --> 00:36:42.667
What shall we do now, my brother?"

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.833
What is the matter?

00:36:44.292 --> 00:36:45.542
You saw how Vijender was talking?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.292
That day he was so
nice and today you heard..

00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:48.792
..how he sounded?

00:36:49.417 --> 00:36:50.667
What is there to see?

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.792
No, I want to know
what is there to see?

00:36:53.292 --> 00:36:54.833
You all have still not understood?

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.083
The whole day you are just
talking of the plot and nothing else.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.833
Now, go and do whatever you want.

00:36:59.958 --> 00:37:01.458
The plot has been seized.

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:08.917
"This is Khosla's nest.
See to it that it doesn't scatter."

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.833
Yes, Mr. Vijender, what I was
trying to tell you is that..

00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:12.833
..in the morning,
we were tensed that is why..

00:37:12.917 --> 00:37:15.750
..we spoke a little rudely.

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:18.792
And you too
unnecessarily took it to heart.

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:22.083
No! No, we had gone to the site.

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.000
Okay, are you in a hurry?

00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:29.333
The thing is that if you could
introduce us to Mr. Khurana..

00:37:29.417 --> 00:37:32.917
..we could solve
the misunderstanding.

00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:35.333
I know that we are troubling you.

00:37:35.417 --> 00:37:37.333
But you know when
someone is in trouble..

00:37:37.417 --> 00:37:39.625
..then one thinks of
only his near ones.

00:37:42.875 --> 00:37:47.333
I am obliged, thank you!
Thank you! Thank you.

00:37:48.792 --> 00:37:49.875
What was he saying?

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:53.667
He was a little angry
because of the afternoon talk.

00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:56.208
Nobody has seized the land.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.208
There is a misunderstanding.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.667
Someone has taken it
to be their land..

00:38:00.667 --> 00:38:03.125
..and built a wall there.
- Papal!

00:38:03.667 --> 00:38:05.583
Vijender was saying
that every month someone..

00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:06.750
..or the other does this blunder.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.208
And then he apologises.

00:38:08.458 --> 00:38:09.542
Papa, I think..

00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:11.500
You have already voiced
your thoughts.

00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:14.250
You go, you go to America!

00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:16.000
As it is, you know everything!

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.292
You already made a
statement that the land is seized.

00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:22.708
Now, you leave the rest to me.

00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:25.792
You go and make arrangements.

00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:27.042
..to go back to America.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.250
Then?
- What then?

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.708
He must have again
gone to that agent to beg.

00:38:46.375 --> 00:38:47.458
You did not go?

00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:48.917
What difference would
it make if I go there?

00:38:49.542 --> 00:38:50.833
I don't know anything about this.

00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:55.375
Anyway, I am going now.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.000
What is the use of getting
involved in all this now?

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.917
You tell me! You do not have
any rehearsals today? - No!

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.750
The Bangalore festival is
going to take place, isn't it?

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.333
Which play are you going to perform?

00:39:11.542 --> 00:39:14.625
Cherry! How can you leave
them in the lurch and walk away?

00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:16.292
Now what is wrong with you?

00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:18.875
No! How can you just go?

00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:23.000
Meghna, this job is of the
property agents and the brokers.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.542
By me staying here,
nothing is going to get solved.

00:39:26.417 --> 00:39:28.667
As it is, the date of my
return is almost fixed.

00:39:30.958 --> 00:39:33.667
Cherry, you are right!
You should go!

00:39:35.958 --> 00:39:38.417
Meghna!
- I am getting late, I have to go.

00:39:38.792 --> 00:39:39.875
But you said that you don't
have any rehearsals today.

00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:41.958
So, can't I go anywhere
else besides my rehearsals?

00:39:42.042 --> 00:39:43.792
Where?
- How does it matter to you?

00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:45.125
Meghna, what is this?

00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:47.083
Cherry, why are you
wasting your time?

00:39:47.792 --> 00:39:51.708
You have nothing left over here.
- Meghna! Meghna!

00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:10.667
Yes, Mr. Vijender! Yes, one minute!

00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:12.583
One minute! One minute!
Yes, tell me.

00:40:13.625 --> 00:40:16.583
Go get a pen! Yes, one minute!
Please hold the line.

00:40:17.292 --> 00:40:18.375
Bunty has gone to get the pen.

00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:21.000
Yes, one minute! Yes,
what were you saying?

00:40:21.292 --> 00:40:22.958
Go take the car out.

00:40:26.667 --> 00:40:28.125
"How much you were troubled?"

00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:30.250
"How much work you have done?"

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:33.167
"Keep your heart tied down."

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.250
"Now whatever has happened,
my Brother."

00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:37.000
"Now what are we going to do?"

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:39.083
"Now we have to think of something."

00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:40.500
This is the Kharbanda farm.

00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:45.167
"If you are smart enough,
you will think of something."

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.333
Baweja.. Baweja farm.

00:40:46.417 --> 00:40:49.417
"Now what are we going to do?"

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.542
We are finding all the names,
but we cannot find..

00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:53.125
..the name that we are searching for.

00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.292
Khurana farm! Khurana farm!

00:40:56.708 --> 00:40:57.792
Is Mr. Khurana there?

00:40:59.292 --> 00:41:00.542
Is Mr. Khurana there?

00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:04.542
Yes, he is there, come, we will go.

00:41:06.917 --> 00:41:08.000
You do not reach on time.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.792
Don't you have any work to do?

00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:13.958
Is he Khurana? - As it is, you
do not work and on top of that..

00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:15.958
..you give excuses.
I will not spare anyone of you.

00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:19.042
I will just have a
word with Mr. Khurana.

00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:21.333
No, he is not the one.
- What do you think of yourself?

00:41:45.958 --> 00:41:48.750
Madam!
- Yes!

00:41:49.292 --> 00:41:50.875
How much more time
will Mr. Khurana take?

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.500
You should have taken an
appointment and then come.

00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:55.042
Madam, what are you saying?

00:41:55.125 --> 00:41:56.375
I think he must be busy
in some important work.

00:41:56.958 --> 00:41:58.042
He is doing the veneration.

00:42:01.125 --> 00:42:02.292
Uncle, please be seated.

00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:10.958
Go ask her,
where shall we get water?

00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:13.958
This time you go and ask.

00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:19.208
And at least comb your hair.

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:25.792
What was I saying..

00:42:26.292 --> 00:42:27.833
Who is Mr. Khosla here?
- Yes!

00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:30.542
Mr. Khurana!
- No! My name is Munjal.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.833
You did not meet him?

00:42:32.542 --> 00:42:34.292
Go up and then go to the
right and then to the left.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:35.458
Why are you sitting here?

00:42:35.542 --> 00:42:36.792
He was saying that they
had cut many vulgar scenes.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.167
Uncle! Kishen Khurana!

00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.333
Kishen Khurana! K.K. Khosla!

00:43:08.083 --> 00:43:10.167
How are you?
- I am fine, sir, you?

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.750
Has anyone offered you
tea or coffee?

00:43:12.583 --> 00:43:16.333
Actually.. - They did not
ask you? Didn't they ask you?

00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:19.708
Did they ask you or not?
- No!

00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:24.917
Service! Come! Come!

00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:27.208
How much do I pay you?

00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:29.458
Tell me, how much do I pay you?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.875
Three thousand!
- Three thousand! Three thousand!

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.083
You fool, will you take
fifty thousand to offer water?

00:43:38.208 --> 00:43:39.958
All lazy people stay in this house.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.042
Order me, uncle!
What would you like to have?

00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:45.375
No! You have come
here for the first time.

00:43:45.458 --> 00:43:46.542
You will definitely
have to take something.

00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:49.375
Water!
- And you? - Pepsi!

00:44:03.292 --> 00:44:06.375
Uncle, tell me!
What can I do for you?

00:44:07.458 --> 00:44:11.458
Yes, sir, that plot in
New Sapna Vihar sector 30..

00:44:11.542 --> 00:44:14.458
..plot number..
-32. - Yes, 32.

00:44:14.542 --> 00:44:16.958
That is ours, sir!

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.333
That is yours?

00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:28.792
Then take it! If it is yours,
then take it.

00:44:32.542 --> 00:44:34.542
Look here, sir, that
plot is in our name.

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:35.875
If you want you can
check the documents.

00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:37.458
Whom are you showing
the documents to?

00:44:39.542 --> 00:44:40.625
I can show you 100 documents...

00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:41.958
..against your one document.

00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:44.458
Do you want to take a look?

00:44:46.042 --> 00:44:48.125
Sir.. that plot..

00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:49.750
What is there in the plot?

00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:54.958
It is just a piece of land.
Am I going to take it away?

00:44:56.708 --> 00:44:58.208
As you can see by
the grace of Goddess..

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.708
..I have everything here.

00:45:00.417 --> 00:45:01.500
There is nothing less!

00:45:02.208 --> 00:45:04.875
This money, this land,
everything will be left back.

00:45:06.333 --> 00:45:08.458
We have come empty handed and we
will go back empty handed too.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.042
What do you say?
- Yes, that is true.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.667
The main happiness are the children.

00:45:17.583 --> 00:45:20.500
We spend our entire life
slogging for the children.

00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:23.625
Yes, sir, you are right!
My other son is a computer engineer.

00:45:23.708 --> 00:45:24.917
Sir, actually we are in a hurry.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.917
Papa has also left the car unlocked.

00:45:27.042 --> 00:45:28.875
So, if we could
please speak to the point.

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:30.417
Is it necessary for
you to speak in between?

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:41.167
Is he your son? He is good! Good!

00:45:41.833 --> 00:45:44.708
He is short tempered!

00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:48.250
Tell him to pray and meditate.

00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:51.875
Twice a day recite
Goddess Vaishnav's name.

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:54.000
It will help you.

00:45:57.542 --> 00:45:58.625
I will tell you one thing, Uncle.

00:45:59.125 --> 00:46:00.208
Your son is at least
sitting with you.

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:05.458
My son feels ashamed to sit with me.

00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:10.458
We have given birth to you,
we have brought you up.

00:46:10.875 --> 00:46:11.958
Nursed you when you were sick.

00:46:12.042 --> 00:46:14.667
And you feel ashamed
to sit with your father?

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:18.333
Lousy snakes!

00:46:21.167 --> 00:46:23.750
Khosla sir, you and
me will talk, okay?

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.250
You go and see what
happened to your Pepsi, go!

00:46:42.417 --> 00:46:46.167
Sir, actually II..
friend's colony bungalow..

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.875
Who gave you the address
of the friend's colony?

00:46:48.833 --> 00:46:52.167
Mr. Vijender of the
World Famous properties.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:56.792
Vijender! Vijender! How is he?

00:46:56.833 --> 00:46:59.083
He is absolutely fine!
We have become good friends now.

00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:02.333
He was the one who did that.
- Very good!

00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:07.208
So, Uncle! You do like this!

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.625
You talk to Vijender only.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.792
I did not understand?

00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:21.625
Uncle, your work is done.

00:47:22.458 --> 00:47:24.458
This is the first
time in so many years..

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:25.792
..that Mr. Khurana in the
first meeting has told someone..

00:47:25.875 --> 00:47:27.292
..that this is your plot.

00:47:28.417 --> 00:47:29.667
He was praising you a lot.

00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:32.000
He said that whatever
Vijender says would be done.

00:47:33.167 --> 00:47:35.458
How much is this plot worth?

00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:39.000
You know it! All together,
it must be around 30 lakh.

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:45.458
30 lakh! So we should start from 15.
- What? What?

00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:47.542
Do you want us to pay 15
lakh for our own land?

00:47:50.125 --> 00:47:52.667
You just forget that
this is your plot.

00:47:53.042 --> 00:47:54.875
Now, you have to think
that you are buying the plot..

00:47:54.958 --> 00:47:56.958
..from Mr. Khurana again.

00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.292
Look here! If you get this 15 lakh..

00:48:00.625 --> 00:48:02.417
That means you have got half
the rate from the market price.

00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:04.708
What better deal can you ask for?

00:48:04.792 --> 00:48:06.542
Do you know what you are saying?
- What am I saying?

00:48:07.458 --> 00:48:08.875
You mean to say that we have
to pay 15 lakh for our own land?

00:48:08.958 --> 00:48:10.917
Your land? And put your hand down.

00:48:11.042 --> 00:48:12.833
What do you mean by put your
hands down? You think we are fools?

00:48:12.917 --> 00:48:14.000
You listen to me.. you
keep your hand down.

00:48:14.083 --> 00:48:15.667
You are showing me your
hand every now and then.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.375
This is our everyday job! Understood.

00:48:17.458 --> 00:48:18.583
Uncle, please make him understand.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.833
Rest is your wish.

00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:24.542
And in such a price where
do you get a land like this?

00:48:26.792 --> 00:48:28.833
You think and let me know. 15 lakh.

00:48:28.917 --> 00:48:30.208
What are we supposed
to pay 15 lakh for?

00:48:30.292 --> 00:48:32.208
As if he will demand
and we will give him.

00:48:32.292 --> 00:48:33.375
If you listen to me,
then there is only one way..

00:48:33.458 --> 00:48:35.708
..to handle such people.

00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:36.958
What is it?

00:48:37.042 --> 00:48:38.542
There is a community of
wrestlers in Dev Nagar.

00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:39.875
They have a very good reputation.

00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:41.792
They can vacate anything, house,
building or land.

00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:43.208
If you say so,
then I will go and find out.

00:48:43.375 --> 00:48:44.875
My dear, son, we are
middle-class people.

00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:47.708
All this fight and
quarrelling is not our cup of tea.

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:49.208
Then give 15 lakh if you have.

00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:53.875
Khosla sir! Khosla sir!

00:48:55.375 --> 00:48:59.458
No! Please do not get depressed.

00:49:00.542 --> 00:49:01.958
Sister-in-law, at least
you make him understand.

00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:05.625
They have snatched away the
savings of my life, Mr. Sahani.

00:49:06.542 --> 00:49:07.625
My land!

00:49:08.417 --> 00:49:11.083
It will not go anywhere!
Nothing will happen to our plot.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.917
Dear Cherry, you get ready!

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.083
We will go to the police station.

00:49:17.417 --> 00:49:19.375
We are going to the police station.

00:49:25.458 --> 00:49:26.542
Now, sir, you only tell us.

00:49:26.708 --> 00:49:29.917
If someone comes and
seizes your property..

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.250
..then what will a decent man do?

00:49:31.375 --> 00:49:33.958
First of all you,
stop calling me sir. Please.

00:49:34.583 --> 00:49:35.958
Khosla sir is like my father.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.083
Thank you! Thank you,
my son! Thank you!

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.917
Uncle, even I am from a
middle-class family like you.

00:49:41.167 --> 00:49:42.250
Even I am earning a salary.

00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:43.667
I can understand your pain.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:46.167
Actually after listening to
some rumours about the police..

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.083
..people do not come to us for help.

00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:50.125
And finally, they have
to bear their own loss.

00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:52.625
These are very normal cases.

00:49:52.833 --> 00:49:54.750
In this you have to go
once and be a little stern..

00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:57.875
..to the party who has
seized the land. That's it!

00:49:57.917 --> 00:50:00.167
What is the price of your land?

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.750
Including the
registration and everything..

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:05.833
..it comes to around 30 lakh.

00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:07.917
And how much is he demanding?

00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:09.458
15 lakh!

00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:15.167
What is his address?

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.583
You come along with me right away.

00:50:17.125 --> 00:50:19.583
I will slap him and
finalise the deal in 10 lakh.

00:50:20.583 --> 00:50:21.667
You give me 2 lakh.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.833
10 and 2 is 12! So your deal
will be finalised in 12 lakh.

00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:26.167
Even then you are still
in profit with 3 lakh.

00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:28.417
You are happy and I am happy.

00:50:30.458 --> 00:50:32.500
Uncle, you will be finished,
but the case wont be.

00:50:33.667 --> 00:50:35.125
It is better to pacify
Khurana in 15 minutes..

00:50:35.208 --> 00:50:36.958
..rather than to pacify
the judge in 15 years.

00:50:38.833 --> 00:50:40.792
If you say so then I can
talk it out in 14 lakh.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.042
Khosla sir, there is
nothing to worry.

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.042
Khurana is our man.

00:50:47.125 --> 00:50:49.042
I will finalise your deal
in 12 or 13.

00:50:49.375 --> 00:50:51.875
The rest you can
donate to the party fund.

00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:54.167
We will do as much as we can.

00:50:55.333 --> 00:50:59.167
Strikes, agitations,
public interest litigations.

00:50:59.542 --> 00:51:01.208
Then they will
automatically come down to 12 lakh.

00:51:02.667 --> 00:51:06.042
And then you can decide
how much donation to give.

00:51:24.042 --> 00:51:26.583
Hello!
- Mr. Chiraunjee Lal! Asif Iqbal!

00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:28.167
Do you want to go to America or not?

00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:36.083
They must have built a wall.

00:51:39.917 --> 00:51:41.000
Only with mud or with bricks?

00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:45.667
Here! Sign here!

00:51:48.583 --> 00:51:51.958
How much have they demanded?
Fifty percent?

00:51:57.542 --> 00:51:58.625
Are you going to give them?

00:52:03.042 --> 00:52:04.125
Where are you going to give from?

00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:09.167
What is your father's age?
- 56.

00:52:10.542 --> 00:52:11.625
He must be about to retire?

00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:13.708
He has one more year.

00:52:15.792 --> 00:52:18.375
He must have invested all
his provident fund money.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.625
And you too are going to America.

00:52:21.792 --> 00:52:23.583
You are going to America, isn't it?

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:26.667
What do you think that
I am filling this form for nothing?

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:28.833
Yes, sign here!

00:52:31.208 --> 00:52:32.625
What name did you say? Khurana!

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.750
It may be, Khurana or
it may be Baweja.

00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:38.958
What are you going to do about it?

00:52:39.917 --> 00:52:41.333
I do not know about Baweja.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.083
But if it is Khurana,
then I can do a lot of things.

00:52:47.917 --> 00:52:50.708
Look here, boss!
Your job is to issue a visa to me.

00:52:50.917 --> 00:52:52.708
I am paying you the
concerned money.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.333
Do not try and interfere in between.

00:52:55.417 --> 00:52:56.500
You will not get anything.

00:52:59.875 --> 00:53:08.042
And 1,2,3,4,5..

00:53:09.167 --> 00:53:16.750
..6,7,8,9.

00:53:17.083 --> 00:53:17.875
I don't think I will be
able to do it. Don't be silly!

00:53:17.917 --> 00:53:19.000
You will get it in 5 minutes.

00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:21.250
No, I will not be able to do it.

00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:22.417
Meghna, listen!

00:53:22.917 --> 00:53:24.250
I have a friend in New York.

00:53:24.333 --> 00:53:26.000
He has an Indian Theatre Group there.
- So?

00:53:26.417 --> 00:53:27.500
You did not understand?

00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:29.542
He needs actors like you.

00:53:30.292 --> 00:53:34.625
Don't you? Don't you need me?
- Do you or don't you?

00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:37.042
No, you don't!

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.542
Come, we will go!
- Why sir, don't you want to go?

00:53:50.708 --> 00:53:51.875
No, it is okay! We will go!

00:53:59.125 --> 00:54:00.208
Where are you barging inside?

00:54:00.375 --> 00:54:01.458
Do you think it is
your father's house?

00:54:03.292 --> 00:54:05.750
Hey, brother Dharampal,
he is my brother, let him come in.

00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:09.167
He is my brother.
- Is he your brother? Okay! Come in.

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:17.333
Come in! Come in!

00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:20.917
Hey, you wrestlers, what is this?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.083
Your plates are empty.

00:54:22.167 --> 00:54:23.375
Take some more! Take some more!

00:54:23.458 --> 00:54:26.042
Hey, you all do not fill
your stomach too much.

00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:27.792
At night you all have to stay awake.

00:54:28.042 --> 00:54:29.542
Guru, one sweet will not matter much.

00:54:30.625 --> 00:54:36.042
A wrestler should always stay fit.

00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:38.833
You go in! - What is this mummy?
- I said you go in!

00:54:38.917 --> 00:54:43.250
"This world is topsy-turvy.."”

00:54:43.375 --> 00:54:44.542
Mummy!
- Not now later!

00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:46.250
Mr. Khosla! Come here!

00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:48.708
"This world is a play.."

00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:50.833
Come and sit down.

00:54:51.125 --> 00:54:53.208
See, I will show you.

00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:55.708
See this, this is a
300 square feet bungalow.

00:54:56.208 --> 00:54:57.333
We emptied it in three days.

00:54:57.708 --> 00:54:58.958
Three lakh fees!

00:54:59.375 --> 00:55:03.958
And this is a two-room flat,
we emptied it in eight hours.

00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:06.375
And this is the bungalow of the MP.

00:55:06.458 --> 00:55:08.042
We emptied it in three hours.

00:55:08.625 --> 00:55:12.125
But for this, our Balbir
Singh had to go to jail.

00:55:13.292 --> 00:55:15.333
Now it is okay that you
do not have the money.

00:55:15.417 --> 00:55:16.917
But give us the money for winning.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.667
Uncle, you do not worry!

00:55:21.833 --> 00:55:23.750
Even Lord Hanuman could not
lift a mountain so quickly..

00:55:23.833 --> 00:55:25.083
..as quickly as we can vacate a land.

00:55:25.167 --> 00:55:26.250
Hail Lord Human!

00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:27.833
Break the enemies bones.

00:55:32.917 --> 00:55:34.917
"These damsels are gorgeous."

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.875
"The monkeys went and sat there.”

00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:41.208
"They think that
they are very great."

00:55:41.292 --> 00:55:45.667
"These gorgeous girls do
not care for the world.”

00:55:46.083 --> 00:55:47.458
Uncle, what do you do?

00:55:48.125 --> 00:55:49.583
I am doing a job!

00:55:49.833 --> 00:55:51.417
Will you drink milk?
- No.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.125
Watch out!

00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:59.000
Here, take, Uncle, you strike first!
- Me?

00:56:01.833 --> 00:56:03.958
Why don't you do it?
- A rule is a rule!

00:56:04.458 --> 00:56:05.542
Come on, hit hard!

00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:12.833
Oh, Uncle! If you hit like this,
your hand will break.

00:56:13.458 --> 00:56:14.542
Look, this is how you hit!

00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:18.000
"Cheer up, buddy."

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:21.958
Hit hard! Hit hard! Very good!

00:56:22.042 --> 00:56:27.667
To hell with you, Khurana..

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:35.792
"Cheer up, buddy."

00:56:36.667 --> 00:56:40.125
"Cheer up, buddy."

00:56:40.458 --> 00:56:44.375
"Cheer up, buddy."

00:56:44.458 --> 00:56:48.833
"Cheer up, buddy."

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.417
Are you all right?

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.000
Everything is going on smoothly.
- "Cheer up, buddy."

00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:57.458
"Cheer up, buddy."
- Very good!

00:56:58.333 --> 00:56:59.833
"Cheer up, buddy."

00:57:16.083 --> 00:57:18.125
Uncle, what do you say?
Is it as it was before?

00:57:18.417 --> 00:57:19.833
It is the same!

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.292
Hail Lord Hanuman!

00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:23.000
Break the bones of the enemy.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.667
"Hey, gentleman go slow."

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:32.375
"There's current in the air..
current in the air.."

00:57:38.417 --> 00:57:41.583
Mr. Khosla! You did an
amazing job in the night.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.083
You did not even inform me?

00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:46.292
He did not even give me the time.

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:48.750
Everything was over
before I could even think.

00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:51.292
And Khurana's men?

00:57:52.333 --> 00:57:53.417
You should have seen
their condition.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.417
They thought that their wall
has collapsed on their head.

00:57:57.167 --> 00:57:58.250
They all ran away.

00:57:58.667 --> 00:57:59.750
You take a wash!

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.667
Had Cherry also gone with you all?
- Of course, he too had come.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.667
Now, he is having a shower.
He does not like mud!

00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:06.792
He too had gone?
What did I tell you?

00:58:07.667 --> 00:58:11.292
K.K. Khosla!
- Yes!

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:12.917
Who is Mr. K.K. Khosla?

00:58:13.833 --> 00:58:17.500
K.K Khosla?
No.. I am Balwant Khosla.

00:58:17.583 --> 00:58:18.750
I am K.K. Khosla! Tell me!

00:58:18.833 --> 00:58:20.625
Come with me to the station.

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:22.958
What for?

00:58:23.417 --> 00:58:24.542
There is a report against you.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.333
Regarding what?

00:58:26.417 --> 00:58:28.625
Capture of Kishen
Khurana's land last night.

00:58:28.958 --> 00:58:32.000
Inspector, where did you
get this wrong report from?

00:58:32.292 --> 00:58:33.708
He owns this land.

00:58:33.958 --> 00:58:35.625
The land is mine.
I have purchased it.

00:58:35.708 --> 00:58:37.958
If you want I can show you the
documents. I have them with me.

00:58:38.042 --> 00:58:39.375
Leave the documents
aside and come along with me.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.958
But I..

00:58:41.375 --> 00:58:44.375
Inspector.. - You stay away.
Stay away! - Sir, listen..

00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:50.292
"You do what the world does.."

00:58:50.375 --> 00:58:52.250
Listen to me..
- "Now you will have to pay."

00:58:52.292 --> 00:58:54.667
"You may live or you may die."

00:58:54.708 --> 00:58:57.333
"You will have to
struggle for life."

00:58:57.458 --> 00:58:58.542
Cherry! Cherry!

00:58:58.583 --> 00:59:05.625
"We will do something..
make all the calculations..”

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.958
"Now what will you do, my Brother?"

00:59:08.042 --> 00:59:09.750
"Where will you go, my Brother?"

00:59:09.833 --> 00:59:15.250
"Now what will you do?
What will you do, my Brother?"

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:22.042
"Look out what's happening,
Brother."

00:59:22.667 --> 00:59:27.042
"Have a look."

00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:35.250
Unlawful entry..
illegal occupation..

00:59:35.417 --> 00:59:39.625
False documents..
attempt to murder..

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.667
..and two counts of horticulture act.

00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:47.125
I have heard, he has
cut down two trees too.

00:59:47.208 --> 00:59:49.125
But sir..
- Already so many charges.

00:59:49.208 --> 00:59:52.125
And the other party is yet
to let loose their lawyer!

00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:54.500
This is absurd! They are the ones
who have occupied it illegally.

00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:55.750
So, did you file the report?

00:59:55.833 --> 00:59:57.167
Yes, we had gone to
the headquarters.

00:59:58.042 --> 00:59:59.208
Then why have you come here?

00:59:59.667 --> 01:00:02.417
Go there! Do you
have any relative there?

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:06.083
The trouble happened in our area,
we got to be involved.

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:07.833
Do I have to spell it out to you?

01:00:08.167 --> 01:00:09.250
Excuse me, just a minute.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.250
The plot is ours, and
the papers are in our name.

01:00:12.167 --> 01:00:14.083
Then how can you lock
him on their complaint?

01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:17.250
I can lock him without any complaint,
what can you do?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.083
What do you mean?

01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:20.917
I'll tell you the meaning inside,
in the language you understand!

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.375
Don't boast of your English,
you impertinent fool!

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:24.708
You can't talk to me like that!

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:27.083
Listen to me..
- What do you think of yourself?

01:00:27.167 --> 01:00:29.667
Get out! - To hell with him..
- You call yourself police!

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.917
Corrupted, bribe takers!

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:32.583
What do you think of yourself?!

01:00:32.667 --> 01:00:35.792
I am taking your age into
consideration. - You listen to me.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:37.917
Or it will be the father
and son in the slammer!

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.083
Sir, please.
- This is a lock-up, not a zoo.

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:44.167
Go away from here. Go!

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.667
Please, cool down, sir.
- Sorry

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.417
What sorry?
- He's a kid, sir. A kid.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.750
If he is a kid, leave him
at home, not on my head.

01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:54.500
Now everything is in your hands,
only you can do something.

01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:55.667
What is there to do?
We will keep him in the lock up..

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.292
till the other party arrives.

01:00:58.458 --> 01:01:02.375
No, sir, can't you let him go
now and call us when they arrive?

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.375
Is it not possible I break your leg?

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:08.375
Give them an inch
and they want a mile?

01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:10.375
Go wait outside!

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:18.042
It's all my fault.

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:21.292
I should not have
got the wrestlers..

01:01:21.292 --> 01:01:22.250
..then this complaint
wouldn't have been there.

01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:35.125
Papa has not even had a
drop of water. - Did he eat?

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:37.667
I offered, but he did not eat.

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:44.333
Papa is inside the
lock-up because of me.

01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:56.167
Cherry, I am telling
you as an elder brother.

01:01:58.625 --> 01:01:59.708
You take off for America.

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:03.667
You don't get involved
and spoil your career.

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:07.917
These problems will keep going on..

01:02:13.417 --> 01:02:14.500
I will take care of this.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:22.167
You go. You go.

01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:38.958
Are you K.K.'s son?
- Yes.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:42.500
I am Munjal. Khurana sir
has sent me.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.542
Come, lets get your
papa released, come.

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:59.333
Khosla sir, good morning. Sir.

01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:08.542
Oh, Khosla sir, I am sorry.

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:11.708
I am sorry, Khosla sir. I am sorry.

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:14.208
Did you have some tea?

01:03:14.292 --> 01:03:15.458
Hey, order for some tea.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:19.667
Khurana sir has personally
called from Vaishnodevi.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.333
Nothing wrong should
happen to Khosla sir.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.167
He sent me here to settle
things and then call him.

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:29.042
But even you committed a mistake.

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:30.208
By calling wrestlers
to settle things.

01:03:30.542 --> 01:03:33.875
When the matter could be solved
by talking, what was the use?

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:35.458
Khosla sir, these property
matters are complicated..

01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:37.708
..that they cannot be settled later.

01:03:38.625 --> 01:03:40.708
Khurana sir has 20 cases going on.

01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:43.125
He will appoint one lawyer.

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:46.250
You have done magic on Khurana sir.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:50.625
He loves you. He said if
Khosla is ready to offer..

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:56.500
..12 lakh, he personally will
come for the house warming ceremony.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.208
12 lakh! Great discount!

01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:00.375
Papa.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.750
Now finish off this drama. Okay?

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:09.292
Khurana sir loves you.

01:04:13.542 --> 01:04:16.250
Doesn't matter, you are back home,
even the plot will come.

01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:20.125
Sahani sir, I don't want the plot.

01:04:20.167 --> 01:04:22.583
But papa.. Why don't
you want the plot?

01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:23.792
I said, that's it!

01:04:30.292 --> 01:04:31.708
Cherry is leaving anyway..

01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:34.125
Even Nikki will get
married and leave.

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:41.792
This house is big enough for
us both. We don't need any plot.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.000
Papa, just one minute..
- Enough.

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:51.875
Brother Cherry, there
is someone to meet you.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.958
The other day you came home,
but didn't come up?

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:05.042
Sorry, I saw you.

01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:09.875
Dad ran into a spot of trouble.

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:12.375
What about the plot?

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.833
What?

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:26.708
I don't know what to do?

01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:32.875
If papa does not get the land back,
he will be a broken man.

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:36.375
I have to get the plot for him.

01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:40.542
Before I go to New York.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:46.292
Good. Need help?

01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:55.292
Cherry, are you sure?
You think this man can help you?

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:59.125
I don't know, he was
saying something about Khurana.

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:04.458
Mr. Chiraunjee Lal?

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.292
This is Asif.
- Iqbal Asif.

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:11.167
There is time for you to leave?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.083
Kid, park it.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.208
It's my own. Easy for conveyance.

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:25.000
Tell me how can I help you?

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:30.333
You had said..

01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:34.208
You had offered help
in the Khurana matter.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:37.000
If you need help, just ask.

01:06:38.542 --> 01:06:39.625
Will you have tea?

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:42.458
Whatever Khurana has done with you..

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:47.417
Khurana and I used to
do the same with others.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.458
I have worked with
him for seven years.

01:06:49.542 --> 01:06:52.083
Were you working
with Khurana previously?

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:55.667
That's what I thought.

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.083
But that devil has never any Kin.

01:07:02.917 --> 01:07:05.167
I had an ancestral land
in Saharanpur.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:09.333
His eyes fell on that.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:11.958
And I could not do anything.

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.167
He took it away in front of my eyes.

01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:19.292
Then.. Khurana continued climbing.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.125
And I started slipping down.

01:07:32.167 --> 01:07:35.208
Anyway, forget about me.
Do you need help?

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:45.917
If Khurana has your land,
he must have the papers too.

01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:48.333
When we have the papers,
how can they be with him?

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:50.750
I used to get the
papers made for him then.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.708
Now it must be
someone else. It's easy.

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.875
Because you don't have any
option in the legal war.

01:07:58.292 --> 01:08:02.125
The fastest way is to pay
and get it back from him.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.708
Wow! That's some help.

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:05.708
We wouldn't be here
if we had the money.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:10.042
Where will we get it from?
We will rob someone.

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:16.500
Good idea. Why don't
you rob Khurana itself?

01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:19.333
Come on, dear Asif.
One second, one second.

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.333
How?

01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:24.250
Look, Khurana's weakness
is his greed for land.

01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:27.792
Why don't you sell him a
dinky little chunk of land?

01:08:28.083 --> 01:08:30.042
If we had land to sell,
with us, then..

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:33.292
Sir, India is the worlds seventh
largest country in terms of land.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.375
There's land everywhere,
you leave it to me.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.083
You mean we should
sell him any plot of land?

01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:40.333
Why any? We will sell him
a nice one.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:41.500
But who will sell it?

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:48.792
Not sell.. pretend to sell.
We did it often.

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:55.750
Just find a sophisticated
looking guy, who can act too.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:58.250
Asif buddy, we came to
you to solve our problem..

01:08:58.333 --> 01:09:01.375
..and you are
involving us in a new problem.

01:09:01.792 --> 01:09:03.208
Where could we find such a man from..

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:10.292
Dear Chiraunjee Lal..

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:13.292
You have to find the right
solution to the right problem.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:18.667
Think. Think.

01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:24.750
You.. are you okay?

01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:27.750
Bapu, are you afraid of acting?

01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:30.417
No, I am afraid of the consequences.

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.667
What you are planning
is called fraud!

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:36.542
And what Khurana has done with us,
what will you call that?

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:37.708
Meghna..

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:39.208
Bapu, you yourself say..

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:43.333
..that don't act just
for money, but for a cause.

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:48.625
Bapu, Cherry's dad.. what
could be a better cause?

01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:51.375
Bapu, you are acting for
nothing since 30 years.

01:09:51.458 --> 01:09:53.625
Now, act for someone's good.

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:59.625
What if something goes wrong?

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:03.458
Bapu, I have never seen you
making mistakes while acting.

01:10:03.542 --> 01:10:06.125
A person who himself
stays in a rented home..

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.500
..what will he know
about land and property?

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:10.542
You leave that to me.

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:12.667
This is Asif.

01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:28.375
Can I smoke?
- Okay.

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:48.458
Bill Gates, look. I am doing
this for her. - Thank you.

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:49.958
And she is doing it for you.

01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:01.583
The man who cons
100 people in a day..

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.083
..you want to con that man.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:13.042
I had always thought of you as a
sensible person, if nothing else.

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:18.292
Now that everything is over,
he has come to his senses.

01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:20.292
I don't want anybody's favour.

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:21.792
The question of favour
doesn't arise.

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:23.958
He wants to help you. And you..

01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:25.292
You call this as help?

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:27.542
We still haven't recovered
from the wrestler's trouble.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.208
And now, he wants to
bring a travelling circus.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.750
This is not help.
This is foolishness!

01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.500
And who told him to help me?

01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:36.250
He has already decided!

01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:38.417
Where he wants to live, what he
wants to do, where he wants to go?

01:11:38.667 --> 01:11:39.750
Then let him do as he wishes!

01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:41.917
There is no need to increase our..

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.458
..and his troubles by helping us!

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:55.458
What has happened to you?

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:57.375
Me? What has happened to me?

01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:58.708
Why did you talk to him like this?

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:01.875
I will talk to him the way I want!
I have lost my land!

01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.042
My house has not been built!

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:06.833
I had to go to the prison!
Now you will teach me how to talk?

01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:09.042
You always misunderstand him.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:12.583
I don't care what he means
to say! Now you listen to me!

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:16.208
I have decided that
I don't want that land!

01:12:16.292 --> 01:12:18.208
I don't want it!
I don't want it! That's it!

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:22.000
The matter is over! Understood!

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:29.083
There is no harm in
listening to what he is saying.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.167
Mr. Sahani, there is no
harm to me. He will be harmed.

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:35.667
The whole of his childhood he
studied and reached this level.

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:37.833
Now, he wants to go to America.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.583
And look what is
going on in his mind.

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:42.708
I lost my plot. Fine,
I have forgotten it.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.083
But I can't endure to see
his career being ruined.

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:48.000
His career is not being ruined.

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:49.333
Yes, Mr. Sahani.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.917
If a professional is
caught doing such a thing..

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.333
..then he has to carry the
stigma for the rest of his life.

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:59.000
What stigma?! What's wrong in
recovering what belongs to you?

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.417
And nowadays nobody
thinks about such things.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.833
Everybody is
concerned about themselves.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.583
Mr. Sahani, he doesn't know
how these people are. I know.

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:11.875
Mr. Khosla, the whole life
you grieved that your son..

01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:15.625
..doesn't support you in
your good and bad times.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.958
When he's extending support now,
why are you suspecting his intention?

01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:22.792
What has to happen will
happen in front of you.

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:25.958
Just wait and watch.
But let him try.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:35.750
Papa, he is Bapu.
He is Asif. Asif Igbal.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.333
And this is Meghna.
- Greetings.

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:50.083
Were you with Khurana?

01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:53.375
Yes.
- Then..

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:56.417
Papa, even he had a plot like us.

01:14:03.083 --> 01:14:07.167
And you? Sir, you.. at this age too,
you are listening to them?

01:14:07.667 --> 01:14:12.500
There is no age to pay heed
to your children, Mr. Khosla.

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:18.917
And you.. why are you
doing so much for us?

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:21.167
l.1..
- What?

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:23.542
l.. Uncle.. I mean..

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:27.917
Papa, she is my friend.
- Thanks.

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:46.708
I've been to the prison once.

01:14:49.625 --> 01:14:51.750
I don't have the strength
to go to the prison again.

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:56.375
And I can't face any
other hardship in my house.

01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.292
The rest is up to you.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.500
No matter what papa says.
But listen to one thing.

01:15:14.667 --> 01:15:16.083
Before doing anything arrange for..

01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:18.000
..a shack in
Rishikesh for papa and me.

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:20.583
So that if the police comes,
we will have a hideout.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.667
You want some tea?
- No. Just some water please.

01:15:40.125 --> 01:15:42.333
The plot owner should
look like an affluent man.

01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:44.000
A very affluent man.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:49.042
And somebody who can't
be traced. NRI type.

01:15:51.917 --> 01:15:53.000
America.

01:15:55.667 --> 01:15:57.583
Canada. Australia!

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.833
Dubai!

01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:06.708
Dubai!

01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:10.500
Wow, Bunty! Not bad!

01:16:12.417 --> 01:16:14.167
People in Dubai
sport beards, don't they?

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.417
They do. But you don't have one.
- Why?

01:16:16.917 --> 01:16:19.208
Because you look smarter this way.

01:16:19.417 --> 01:16:21.417
Now shut up and shave.

01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:23.000
What are you doing?

01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:28.083
We need to hire a
luxurious car.. and a driver.

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:31.125
I'll arrange for it.

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:32.875
And his name will be..

01:16:37.625 --> 01:16:40.708
Sethi. NRI Sethi.

01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:42.375
Good, good.

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:47.542
He has come from Dubai.
He is staying in a 5 star hotel.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.583
He has two mobile phones.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:52.250
But that number can be traced.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.000
We'll get two SIM cards from Dubai.

01:16:55.083 --> 01:16:57.083
If we call anybody, then the number
of that place will be flashed.

01:16:57.583 --> 01:16:58.667
Brilliant!

01:16:59.292 --> 01:17:02.958
I know guys there. But why two?

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:06.250
Such a big party doesn't
talk to a person directly.

01:17:07.125 --> 01:17:12.292
He tells others. We need a secretary!
Am I right, ma'am?

01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:15.458
Bapu, there was a call
from Bangalore.

01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:16.625
They need two more shows.

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:18.625
And that Govind's
mother is still not well.

01:17:18.708 --> 01:17:19.792
So, I have fixed Kishore.

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:22.250
I still haven't
spoken to the hotel guys.

01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:29.917
What?

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.917
We have got a nice role
for you. Will you do it?

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:37.667
The costumes have arrived.
Mercedes is also there.

01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:42.333
Now, it's up to you and Bapu, Mani.

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:44.667
I will handle it. Don't worry.

01:17:45.917 --> 01:17:47.000
Thanks.

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:49.333
What thanks? If not for Bapu,
then I would have been..

01:17:49.417 --> 01:17:51.750
..selling eggs
at Mughalsarai station.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:54.500
Come on. This is better.

01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:59.667
If you want to trap the big fish..
then first trap the small fish.

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.667
The big fish will come on its own.

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:04.875
What do you mean?
- Vijender.

01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:10.208
Sir, you have called
at the right place.

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:12.375
Yes, sir. You don't worry.

01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:13.625
There will be
a queue of buyers, sir.

01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:14.958
Sir, I am a genuine party.

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:16.875
Yes! What?

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:19.792
Party, sir? Yes, sir.

01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:22.625
Sir, the party will come. Yes, sir.

01:18:22.917 --> 01:18:25.750
Whenever you want! No, no, sir!

01:18:26.292 --> 01:18:28.625
10 means 10! Okay, sir!

01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:31.958
Okay, sir! Okay!

01:18:36.833 --> 01:18:40.250
"Day! Day! Day! Day.
Something is happening.”

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:42.000
"Something is happening.”

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:44.458
"Something is happening.”

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:46.667
"Day! Day! Day! Day."

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:48.083
"Something is happening.”

01:18:48.167 --> 01:18:51.667
Remember.. broker..
party. Broker.. party.

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:54.917
Its 10:10! Go!
- Mobile!

01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:57.000
"Something is going on."

01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:59.708
What if it rings?
- Who knows the number?

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:02.125
Have you seen the clock?
He is waiting. Let's go.

01:19:02.375 --> 01:19:03.458
Let's go! Come on!

01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:05.292
"Something is going on."
- I love you, Bapu.

01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:07.208
"Something is going on."

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:10.375
"Day! Day! Day! Day."
- All the best.

01:19:11.292 --> 01:19:13.792
You are looking perfect.
You are looking perfect.

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:15.042
Don't feel nervous.

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:18.708
You have performed such
great roles and this NRI Sethi..

01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:20.208
It's nothing, sir.

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:21.375
It's nothing!

01:19:21.458 --> 01:19:22.542
I am feeling so nervous.

01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:24.125
Then let's go back.
- Okay.

01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:28.458
You have won 135 awards.
135 awards! This..

01:19:28.792 --> 01:19:30.375
Good morning, sir!
- Good morning.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:31.542
At least say good morning.

01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:35.208
No problem. He is
sitting there. Go! Go!

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.583
Hello, sir. I am Vijender Kumar.

01:19:50.917 --> 01:19:53.167
I was talking to you.
Welcome to India, sir.

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:54.333
Sir, come. Have a seat.

01:19:54.417 --> 01:19:55.500
Are you the broker or the party?

01:19:55.583 --> 01:19:56.667
Sir, at least have a seat.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.000
Are you the broker or the party?

01:19:58.083 --> 01:19:59.833
Sri, we will talk about that later.
- What am I asking you?

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.667
Are you the broker or the party?

01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:04.417
Sir, I am the broker.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.417
What did I tell you? I don't want
to talk to a broker.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.583
Didn't I tell you?

01:20:07.667 --> 01:20:08.750
Sir, he was supposed
to come with the party.

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:09.917
Sir, hear me out.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.167
You want me to lose my job?

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.167
Call me if you find
a buyer by evening.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.583
Otherwise get lost!

01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:16.667
Sir..
- Listen to me.. listen..

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:21.500
Bapu, you were terrific!

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.417
Don't look back! Don't look back!

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:25.000
Do you have a handkerchief?

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:26.417
Don't wipe now. He is still there.

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:30.167
Bapu was fantastic!

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:31.750
The style he used to
turn around and walk..

01:20:31.833 --> 01:20:34.417
..I felt as if Vijender
will get a heart attack.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.417
I don't know about him.
But I surely was going to get one.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.583
Shut up!

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:42.833
I think I overdid it.
Now he won't call.

01:20:42.917 --> 01:20:45.333
Even his father will call.

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:48.167
If he has reached to his father..

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:55.500
How many acres did he say?
-9,

01:20:58.083 --> 01:21:00.083
On the highway?
- Yes.

01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:03.083
Sir, if what he is saying is true..

01:21:03.167 --> 01:21:05.750
..then the rates will double
up after the highway is built.

01:21:09.667 --> 01:21:11.000
It will triple.

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:14.667
Who is the party?

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:19.167
Party.. forget the party.
For you, I am the party.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.750
You will become the
party for us? Fool!

01:21:22.042 --> 01:21:24.000
Look, he is an NRI party.

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:26.375
He has come from Dubai. He wants
to sell it quickly and return.

01:21:26.417 --> 01:21:28.958
That's why I was saying this.

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:35.250
How much do you want?

01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:39.500
You can give me..3%.

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:41.958
Has your father ever seen 3%?

01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:44.875
Look.. look, sir, according to me..

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.542
..it will be a deal of
at least 1-1.5 crore.

01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:51.083
So, even I will earn some money.

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:03.667
Nowadays you have started
demanding too much. Fool!

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.375
What is this?
- Cherry has ordered it.

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:13.958
He was saying there are
many people in the house.

01:22:14.042 --> 01:22:15.208
So don't cook.

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:18.875
Shall I cook some vegetable for you?

01:22:19.292 --> 01:22:20.375
Let it be.

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.833
Now will the food not be cooked
in the house because of them?!

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:32.417
And what are they doing?
- They are working hard.

01:22:32.583 --> 01:22:35.500
They are booking a room in
a 5 star hotel for Khurana's meeting.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:36.750
A room in a 5 star hotel!

01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:39.833
Are they their relatives?

01:22:40.583 --> 01:22:43.333
Or these actors have put
up a set for them too?

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:45.833
Who will pay for it?

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:48.333
Cherry.
- He has gone mad!

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.667
It's futile to splurge
money on something..

01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:51.333
..that we have already lost!

01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:53.500
How much have they spent?

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:57.667
Bunty was saying
around 15,000-20,000.

01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:01.458
15,000-20,000! Tell
him to stop this madness!

01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:03.125
It's futile to splurge
money on something..

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:04.792
..that we have already lost!

01:23:05.125 --> 01:23:06.208
Tell him that!

01:23:06.292 --> 01:23:07.375
Why don't you tell him personally?

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:10.375
Me? Why should I tell him?
Let him splurge!

01:23:10.917 --> 01:23:12.250
It's his money. Let him splurge!

01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:13.417
It's none of my business.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.833
Then why are you worried?

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:17.708
l.. l.. this..

01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:22.292
Do you have some chutney?

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:25.208
When I reached home,
I saw it was locked.

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:28.000
Then I saw..
- It's 9. And they haven't called.

01:23:28.917 --> 01:23:31.042
It's only 9. It will surely come.

01:23:31.125 --> 01:23:33.375
I can't even eat.
- It will surely come.

01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:37.625
You mean you lived all alone?
- All alone? - Yes.

01:23:37.792 --> 01:23:38.875
Wow!

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:40.042
What about your parents?

01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:42.208
Mummy is in Kolkata.
And daddy is in Bangalore.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.792
I see. Your daddy must
have got transferred.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:46.042
No, he lives there.

01:23:46.708 --> 01:23:49.208
Then why does your
mummy reside in Kolkata?

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.958
Actually, they are divorced.

01:23:55.625 --> 01:23:57.792
I'll take it.
- No, aunt. I will keep it. You..

01:23:57.875 --> 01:23:58.958
Cherry.

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:02.417
Mr. Khosla, come. Have a seat.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.000
No, please. You
remain seated. One moment.

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:06.667
Tell me, Papa.

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:11.500
I have heard that you
have spent 10,000-15,000.

01:24:11.958 --> 01:24:13.708
Yes, we needed some things.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.042
I know what you needed.

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.292
SIM card is coming from Dubai!

01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:22.292
Hired cars! Rooms in 5 star hotel!

01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:23.542
Papa, it's okay. I am handling it.

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:26.958
Are you doing..
are you doing a favour on me!

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.750
There is no need to
act like a tycoon.

01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:31.333
Stop dreaming. He is Khurana!

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:33.333
He is smarter than you.
Nobody is going to call you.

01:24:33.417 --> 01:24:35.750
Papa..
- Look, Cherry. I am your father.

01:24:35.833 --> 01:24:37.000
Even I know certain things.

01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:38.292
No phone is going to come.
I know it.

01:24:38.792 --> 01:24:40.792
Cherry! Cherry!
- Brother, the call!

01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:42.583
Cherry, the call!

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:45.458
Phone! Phone! Phone!

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.792
No, you take it.
- You talk. - Yes.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:50.375
You speak to him.
- Come on.

01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:55.417
Hello.

01:24:56.667 --> 01:24:57.750
Yes.

01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:00.333
Yes, yes, yes.

01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:07.750
Bring them.. to Surya hotel.
At 3 o'clock.

01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:11.042
Yes, Mr. Sethi has a suite there.

01:25:12.292 --> 01:25:13.375
You want to meet him alone?

01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:16.625
No! No! No!

01:25:17.375 --> 01:25:18.875
No, you can't meet him alone.

01:25:18.958 --> 01:25:21.375
Look, I will fix
this meeting for you.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.417
I don't want any commission.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:30.333
And don't even talk to
me like this. Understood?

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:32.167
Goodbye.

01:25:36.917 --> 01:25:38.000
What?

01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:39.333
What happened?

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:40.583
What?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.333
Great!

01:25:50.417 --> 01:25:53.583
Yes!

01:25:53.667 --> 01:25:58.750
That was great!

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:01.417
It was great fun!

01:26:05.625 --> 01:26:09.458
"The scene is
gradually being created.”

01:26:13.292 --> 01:26:17.375
"The twilight is getting
converted into dawn gradually.”

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:24.875
"The world is sleeping.
Somebody is awake."

01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:28.542
"Something is getting destroyed."

01:26:28.625 --> 01:26:34.542
"Look, look, something is happening.”

01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:38.250
"Day! Day! Day! Day."

01:26:38.333 --> 01:26:40.000
"Something is happening.”

01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:41.833
"Something is happening.”

01:26:41.917 --> 01:26:43.833
"Something is happening.”

01:26:43.917 --> 01:26:45.750
"Day! Day! Day! Day."

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.417
"Something is happening.”

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.167
"Something is happening.”

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:51.250
"Something is happening.”

01:26:51.333 --> 01:26:53.417
"Day! Day! Day! Day."

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.542
They must have
reached the suite by now.

01:26:58.625 --> 01:26:59.708
I am scared.

01:26:59.792 --> 01:27:02.333
Forget suite, Bapu has
never been to a coffee shop.

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:06.542
Rs.150 for tea!

01:27:07.625 --> 01:27:10.292
Such a grand hotel
and a printing mistake. Look!

01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:11.958
Look at this!

01:27:13.125 --> 01:27:14.750
No, Bapu. I don't
think it is a mistake.

01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:16.792
Maybe it costs Rs.150.

01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:20.125
Forget it! We don't
have to order for it!

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.125
We will have to order something..

01:27:22.208 --> 01:27:23.292
..otherwise, it will look very odd.

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:26.917
Order the cheapest thing for me.
What's the cheapest thing?

01:27:28.167 --> 01:27:29.250
Tea.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.958
Listen.. I don't think
they will come. Let's go.

01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:41.375
Bapu! Why are you shaking your legs?

01:27:41.625 --> 01:27:43.375
I can shake whatever I want!
It's none of your business!

01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:45.500
Don't I have this much freedom?

01:27:45.583 --> 01:27:47.583
Bapu, don't get nervous.

01:27:47.667 --> 01:27:48.750
I will handle everything.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:50.167
You just be in your character.

01:27:51.417 --> 01:27:53.167
Let's do one more rehearsal.
- Okay.

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:56.250
Name.
- M. L. Sethi.

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:58.167
Yes. Where do you stay?

01:27:58.833 --> 01:28:03.083
Noida. Afzal street, Hamza, Dubai.

01:28:04.167 --> 01:28:05.417
Yes. Business?

01:28:06.875 --> 01:28:08.458
Hotel!
- Hotel! Hotel!

01:28:08.542 --> 01:28:09.625
Textile!
- Textile!

01:28:09.708 --> 01:28:11.458
Software!
- Software!

01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:13.292
Sorry! Sorry!

01:28:14.042 --> 01:28:19.292
I will handle everything! You just do
what Asif has told you to do.

01:28:22.458 --> 01:28:23.583
What are you doing?

01:28:24.167 --> 01:28:26.125
You should have gone earlier!

01:28:32.625 --> 01:28:35.250
Welcome! Welcome! Come! Come!

01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:37.458
He is Mr. Khurana. He is Mr. Munjal.
- Greetings.

01:28:37.542 --> 01:28:39.458
He is Mr. Sethi's secretary.
- Come. Come.

01:28:39.708 --> 01:28:41.458
Please come.
- Come! Come!

01:28:41.625 --> 01:28:43.500
Please have a seat!
- Come!

01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:45.208
Make yourself comfortable.

01:28:45.292 --> 01:28:46.625
Come! Come!

01:28:46.708 --> 01:28:47.792
Shall I order something?

01:28:48.042 --> 01:28:49.125
Nothing.

01:28:49.292 --> 01:28:52.125
Mr. Sethi is in a conference call.

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:53.792
Ministry on one hand
and Dubai on the other.

01:28:54.542 --> 01:28:55.625
Have a seat.

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:58.375
Here! Have the offerings.
- What is this for?

01:28:58.458 --> 01:28:59.708
Mr. Khurana has got it.
- Is that so?

01:29:00.583 --> 01:29:02.583
He goes to Tirupati
before making a big deal.

01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:05.917
Great! And where does he
go after the big deal?

01:29:17.792 --> 01:29:19.708
Mr. Munjal, what do I tell you
about Mr. Sethi?

01:29:19.792 --> 01:29:20.875
I have already met him.

01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:22.375
He looks just like a film-star.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.542
Hello, everybody.

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:26.958
Hello, sir. He is Mr. Khurana.

01:29:31.792 --> 01:29:32.958
Hello.
- Hello.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.042
Sir, Mr. Khurana is
interested in buying your land.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.208
Are you a party or a broker?

01:29:43.458 --> 01:29:44.792
Sir, what are you saying?

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:50.708
I am not talking to you at all.
Are you a party or a broker?

01:29:55.167 --> 01:29:57.333
Party.

01:29:59.083 --> 01:30:00.750
Good! Good!

01:30:02.083 --> 01:30:04.083
Shall we come to the point then?

01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:19.292
The minister is very happy.
The deal is through.

01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:22.083
Great, sir! Great!

01:30:23.958 --> 01:30:25.292
So..

01:30:26.708 --> 01:30:28.958
Sir, Khurana.
- Yes. Mr. Khurana.

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:32.333
I talk clearly.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.833
I come to India twice a year.

01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:40.667
Once I go to visit Tirupati.
And once to visit Vaishnodevi.

01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:43.083
Mr. Sethi is a great
devotee of Goddess Vaishnodevi.

01:30:43.167 --> 01:30:44.750
He offers lakhs every year.

01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:45.917
Wonderful!

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:50.458
When the Goddess calls,
I can't stop myself.

01:30:51.708 --> 01:30:55.250
You might find this strange.
Am I right?

01:30:55.792 --> 01:30:57.792
No, no. Please continue.

01:30:59.708 --> 01:31:01.458
What is there to say, Mr. Khurana?

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.250
It is a small piece
of ancestral land.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.000
I just want somebody who
will take good care of it.

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:10.917
But nowadays, you
don't find such people..

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.333
..who love their land.

01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:18.167
Sir, Mr. Khurana loves land so much..

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:21.500
Will you take tea or something?
- No.

01:31:21.583 --> 01:31:23.500
Something cold?
- No.

01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:25.667
Then what will you take
to keep quiet? - No, no..

01:31:56.917 --> 01:31:59.125
They are taking so much time.
I am sure something is wrong.

01:31:59.458 --> 01:32:02.208
It's all my fault! I
shouldn't have forced Bapu!

01:32:02.292 --> 01:32:03.375
I will call up on the cell.

01:32:03.458 --> 01:32:06.125
No, no! We will wait.

01:32:06.292 --> 01:32:09.958
Only land is worth to be loved.
What else is left nowadays?

01:32:11.333 --> 01:32:15.667
Amazing! I am searching for the man..
and he is in front of me!

01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:17.167
So, shall I consider
the deal as final?

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:18.750
Of course.

01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:23.083
I just had.. a small request.

01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:25.042
Tell me.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.042
I just wanted to see the plot once.

01:32:31.917 --> 01:32:38.458
Yes, why not? When do
you want to have a look?

01:32:39.417 --> 01:32:40.500
Now.

01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:41.917
Now?

01:32:44.917 --> 01:32:46.042
Why? Any problem?

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.917
No, no.. no.. problem..

01:32:49.667 --> 01:32:51.667
There is no problem
in having a look.

01:32:51.958 --> 01:32:55.667
Actually.. actually,
sir doesn't want to say it.

01:32:55.750 --> 01:33:00.333
He finalises all big deals
on Fridays.

01:33:01.667 --> 01:33:02.833
It's the blessing of the Goddess.

01:33:05.333 --> 01:33:07.583
It's just a request.

01:33:10.542 --> 01:33:13.208
Mr. Sethi, if the
Goddess doesn't give me..

01:33:13.292 --> 01:33:15.708
..the permission then how
can I dare to look at it?

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:20.042
I will come whenever you say.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.792
But then it will be mine.

01:33:29.958 --> 01:33:32.792
Friday! Blessing of the Goddess!

01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:36.625
Keep quiet!
He wants to see the plot!

01:33:37.208 --> 01:33:40.375
And that is the problem. Where
will we bring the land from?

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:42.083
Has anybody thought of that?

01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:47.292
There is a land.
- Which one?

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.458
There is one in that area.

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:53.875
I have saved it for my retirement.

01:33:55.792 --> 01:33:57.708
You mean you are the
owner of such a big plot?

01:33:59.417 --> 01:34:00.500
No.

01:34:00.583 --> 01:34:02.333
Then how did you save
it for your retirement?

01:34:06.333 --> 01:34:07.750
I understood! I understood!

01:34:09.208 --> 01:34:10.833
But who is the owner?

01:34:12.417 --> 01:34:16.167
Fish. It is the
fisheries department land.

01:34:16.583 --> 01:34:18.833
A fish research institute
was about to be built there.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:21.417
But government doesn't
have the time for humans..

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.333
..then why will
they think about fish?

01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:24.750
It has been lying
vacant for eight years.

01:34:25.417 --> 01:34:27.000
There is nothing except a board.

01:34:28.833 --> 01:34:30.417
But we will have to do
the make-up of that land.

01:34:30.667 --> 01:34:31.750
Make-up?

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:34.917
So that everything in that
plot should look like ours.

01:34:39.958 --> 01:34:47.583
The trees.. the plants.. the birds..
the luggage.. and people.

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:49.167
"Day! Day!"

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:52.500
"Year."

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:57.167
"Year."

01:34:57.708 --> 01:34:58.958
"Day! Day!"

01:34:59.375 --> 01:35:00.792
"Count! Count!”

01:35:01.042 --> 01:35:04.042
"Year."

01:35:04.708 --> 01:35:07.708
"Day! Day! Count! Count!"

01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:10.958
"Year."

01:36:12.625 --> 01:36:13.958
Welcome, Mr. Khurana!

01:36:14.958 --> 01:36:16.042
How are you, Mr. Sethi?

01:36:16.292 --> 01:36:17.458
Come, Mr. Khurana!

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:19.792
Did you have any
problem in finding the land?

01:36:20.458 --> 01:36:22.542
I never have problem
in finding the plot.

01:36:23.625 --> 01:36:25.458
This is what I have. Have a look.

01:36:25.542 --> 01:36:28.375
Sir, he is Insaan Singh.
He is the caretaker.

01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:29.958
And she is his mother.

01:36:33.042 --> 01:36:34.792
If you don't mind,
can I look around?

01:36:34.875 --> 01:36:35.958
Yes. Why not?

01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:37.542
No, you sit. You sit.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.875
Yes, you sit.
I will show him around.

01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:40.958
You go and have buttermilk.

01:36:41.875 --> 01:36:43.375
Insaan Singh will
show me around. Fine?

01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:46.292
Okay.
- Me?

01:36:46.542 --> 01:36:49.708
Yes, you. You know the plot well.
- Is that so?

01:36:49.792 --> 01:36:51.458
Yes. Now go.

01:36:53.333 --> 01:36:54.417
Go!

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:55.583
Go! Come, sir.

01:37:03.583 --> 01:37:05.833
Come on, Satan Singh!
- Sir, Insaan Singh.

01:37:05.917 --> 01:37:07.000
Okay.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.333
How long have you been here?
- Since the morning.

01:37:13.417 --> 01:37:14.500
What?

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:17.667
I mean since years.
But I arrived this morning.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.500
Tell me about the plot.

01:37:20.917 --> 01:37:24.000
What should I tell you..
about the plot, sir?

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:31.042
It's a big plot. There are stones..
trees.. mud.. temple.

01:37:31.458 --> 01:37:33.375
Temple? Where is the temple?

01:37:33.958 --> 01:37:38.042
Temple.. it's far away,
sir. it's a big plot.

01:37:39.375 --> 01:37:40.542
Why is he selling it then?

01:37:41.208 --> 01:37:42.292
Why does he want to sell it?

01:37:42.375 --> 01:37:44.958
That is what we don't know,
sir. Why does he want to sell it?

01:37:45.042 --> 01:37:46.125
It's such a lovely plot of land.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.500
It's his land. He wants to
sell it. Why are you concerned?

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.667
Greetings.
- Greetings.

01:37:53.917 --> 01:37:56.000
They are Mr. Sethi's men.

01:37:56.333 --> 01:37:57.417
Okay! Let's move!

01:37:59.125 --> 01:38:00.958
Who named you Satan Singh?

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:03.292
No, sir. My name is Insaan Singh.

01:38:03.375 --> 01:38:05.208
You forgot your name?
- What?

01:38:05.292 --> 01:38:06.792
They were calling you Satan Singh.

01:38:07.208 --> 01:38:09.292
No, sir. I am Insaan (human) Singh.

01:38:09.375 --> 01:38:11.792
I know you are a human.
But why is your name Satan Singh?

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:13.667
Sir, what can I say?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.083
It's a good name.

01:38:16.375 --> 01:38:17.958
Katori!
- Oh, God!

01:38:18.042 --> 01:38:19.125
How are you?

01:38:20.458 --> 01:38:22.542
Greetings, sir!
- Greetings.

01:38:22.958 --> 01:38:26.208
Katori, is everything well?
- Sir, it is going on.

01:38:27.083 --> 01:38:29.083
You hardly come here nowadays.

01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:33.250
Just like that. Sir, come.

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:37.833
She comes to cut the grass, sir.

01:38:38.417 --> 01:38:40.667
She takes more than what she works.

01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:44.208
Let her do it! Go on!
Take as much as you want.

01:38:44.542 --> 01:38:48.042
Okay, sir. Fool!

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:03.333
Sir, you have seen everything.
Nothing else..

01:39:07.042 --> 01:39:09.125
Yes! Sir, there is a well!

01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:11.208
You want to take a bath?

01:39:13.542 --> 01:39:14.792
This man is mad!

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.042
Sir, what happened?
You want to take a bath?

01:39:20.625 --> 01:39:23.792
Come. Let's go.

01:39:35.542 --> 01:39:37.125
Sir, buttermilk.

01:39:37.375 --> 01:39:39.625
Sir, have it. Buttermilk.

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.125
How is it?

01:39:47.875 --> 01:39:51.375
Mr. Sethi, it is the business norm.

01:39:51.458 --> 01:39:54.208
You shouldn't praise a
thing before buying it.

01:39:57.792 --> 01:40:00.708
You didn't tell me that you
have built a Goddess' temple.

01:40:02.458 --> 01:40:05.208
Who am I to build a Goddess' temple?

01:40:05.458 --> 01:40:08.292
Where Goddess wills,
the temple is made there.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.417
We just pile up the bricks.
Nothing else.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:16.667
Correct. Correct.

01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:19.083
Mr. Sethi, I want to
sit with you some day.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:22.833
First, give me the land.

01:40:22.917 --> 01:40:25.750
It's all yours. It's
just a burden for me.

01:40:26.167 --> 01:40:28.333
Then I will shed your burden.
Let's have a look at the paper.

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:33.083
Papers? - It's just a formality.
But we have to do it.

01:40:33.417 --> 01:40:35.833
Mr. Khurana is very
strict about these things.

01:40:36.833 --> 01:40:38.333
Then when?

01:40:38.917 --> 01:40:40.833
Whenever you want. I will call you.

01:40:41.167 --> 01:40:42.917
Mr. Sethi, permit me to leave.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.167
Come on!

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:48.875
Sir, be careful.

01:40:51.292 --> 01:40:53.208
Sir, the lady is greeting you.

01:40:58.792 --> 01:41:01.542
Papa, here are the papers.

01:41:03.208 --> 01:41:04.375
Oh, God!

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.042
Power cut!

01:41:07.917 --> 01:41:09.000
Where is the torch?

01:41:18.542 --> 01:41:19.708
Where did you get this document?

01:41:19.792 --> 01:41:21.458
Papa, we got it somehow.

01:41:21.625 --> 01:41:24.542
Just think that all the people
who have worked for Khurana..

01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:28.417
..for so many years, a gift
to Khurana on their behalf.

01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:31.458
Even Khurana's father
can't find a mistake in this.

01:41:32.208 --> 01:41:34.375
You are great! Make me your student!

01:41:34.458 --> 01:41:38.208
No need for that.
Tell me the truth now.

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:39.458
Where did you get the papers?

01:41:39.542 --> 01:41:40.708
Papa, I am telling you.

01:41:41.333 --> 01:41:44.333
Mr. Khosla, if I told you the truth..

01:41:44.417 --> 01:41:46.917
..then you won't allow
us to use this paper.

01:41:47.125 --> 01:41:52.000
And if we don't use it, then
Khurana will never buy the land.

01:41:52.667 --> 01:41:55.583
And if he doesn't buy the land,
you won't get the plot back.

01:41:57.792 --> 01:42:01.375
Now you decide. You want
the truth or the plot?

01:42:01.792 --> 01:42:02.875
Plot.

01:42:06.375 --> 01:42:10.792
Mr. Khosla, the iron is hot..
and this is the hammer.

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:12.542
Hit it.

01:42:42.708 --> 01:42:49.958
Mr. Sethi, only I can
make such authentic papers.

01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:52.667
I hope it's not forged.

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:55.083
Sir, what are you saying?

01:42:56.083 --> 01:42:58.667
Will Mr. Sethi give you fake papers?

01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:01.750
No, no. Even if it's fake,
we will make it authentic.

01:43:03.417 --> 01:43:05.333
You tell me. What's the price?

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.583
Tell me, Mr. Sethi.

01:43:06.667 --> 01:43:09.667
Whatever you think is fair.

01:43:10.458 --> 01:43:12.708
No, no. You must be
expecting something.

01:43:13.125 --> 01:43:16.792
No, no. I don't have
any expectations.

01:43:16.875 --> 01:43:18.958
Still.
- 1.5.

01:43:19.208 --> 01:43:23.042
No. 1.5 is too much.
Reduce it a bit.

01:43:23.125 --> 01:43:24.583
Think something about us too.

01:43:25.458 --> 01:43:27.625
A bit.
- 1.25.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.917
Okay.
- 1.35.

01:43:31.792 --> 01:43:32.875
No, no..

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.875
Okay. Mr. Sethi.
What will I bargain with you?

01:43:37.208 --> 01:43:41.208
Neither mine, nor yours.
1 crore 30 lakh.

01:43:41.917 --> 01:43:43.083
Half in cash.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:44.583
No problem.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.250
So, Mr. Sethi. This is the advance.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.500
It's 35 lakh.
The rest after getting the land.

01:43:50.833 --> 01:43:51.917
Count it.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.333
No, please count it.

01:44:00.292 --> 01:44:01.375
No, I will make a move.

01:44:02.625 --> 01:44:03.792
No, I have to go.

01:44:03.875 --> 01:44:05.958
Mr. Sethi, at least take the cash.
- I will leave.

01:44:06.292 --> 01:44:08.208
Mr. Sethi! Mr. Sethi!

01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:11.208
Mr. Sethi! Mr. Sethi!

01:44:23.958 --> 01:44:26.458
You didn't bring the money?
- Why?

01:44:27.625 --> 01:44:28.958
Why are you asking me? Ask him.

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:31.625
Him? What to ask him?

01:44:31.708 --> 01:44:33.542
What have you done?
You spoiled a finalised deal!

01:44:33.625 --> 01:44:34.708
Papa, what the hell!

01:44:35.833 --> 01:44:40.167
35 lakh! Leaving Khurana's
12 lakh, we still had 23 lakh.

01:44:40.333 --> 01:44:41.417
23 lakh in cash!

01:44:41.917 --> 01:44:43.917
Cash! The man who has not seen
Rs.35..

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.417
..you are telling him to
bring 35 lakh in cash!

01:44:46.583 --> 01:44:47.833
Aren't you all ashamed!

01:44:47.917 --> 01:44:49.083
Papa, what are you saying?

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.750
Hang on! Hang on!

01:44:55.875 --> 01:44:56.958
Have this.

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.583
You want more?

01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:08.833
No.

01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:13.500
Mr. Khosla, I am very sorry.

01:45:14.292 --> 01:45:17.542
What you have done? Nobody
would have done even that.

01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:20.750
You are blaming him for ruining it!

01:45:22.583 --> 01:45:24.583
If he had not taken so much trouble..

01:45:24.667 --> 01:45:26.083
..then we couldn't
have even achieved that.

01:45:26.167 --> 01:45:28.083
What are you saying?
The plan has been sabotaged!

01:45:28.167 --> 01:45:32.583
What plan? Phoney land..
phoney papers.. everything phoney!

01:45:33.667 --> 01:45:35.333
Is this what you all
have learnt in this house?

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.750
Papa, even Khurana
uses phoney papers..

01:45:36.833 --> 01:45:38.417
I don't care what Khurana does!

01:45:39.167 --> 01:45:41.000
But I am not Khurana!
Do you understand!

01:45:41.083 --> 01:45:42.167
I am not Khurana!

01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:43.500
Calm down.
- I am fine!

01:45:45.667 --> 01:45:46.750
Had I been in his place,
I would have done..

01:45:46.833 --> 01:45:48.083
..exactly what he did!

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:52.708
This is called decency!
If you remember this word!

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.583
Or else even you have become..

01:45:54.667 --> 01:45:56.417
..like those who called me
uncle and..

01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:05.833
Please end this now. End it.

01:46:11.792 --> 01:46:15.458
Tell him to fill his
visa form tomorrow.

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:22.958
Khurana!

01:46:26.625 --> 01:46:30.375
Hello. Yes. Yes.

01:46:31.375 --> 01:46:34.583
Yes! No! What?

01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:39.500
Okay. Okay.

01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:43.833
Okay.

01:46:49.167 --> 01:46:50.583
It was Khurana's secretary's call.

01:46:52.333 --> 01:46:55.750
He said that after Mr. Sethi left..

01:46:55.833 --> 01:47:00.333
..we realised that maybe we
have offered very less money.

01:47:02.417 --> 01:47:05.500
Khurana is ready to
give 1 crore 40 lakh.

01:47:06.167 --> 01:47:07.333
Yes!

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.833
Whatever Bapu does, it is right!

01:47:12.167 --> 01:47:13.833
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:19.250
But he wants to pay
the advance on the plot.

01:47:19.417 --> 01:47:22.000
He wants to see the plot again.

01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:26.083
On the plot. It means again..

01:47:26.875 --> 01:47:28.292
Everybody has gone to Bangalore.

01:47:28.458 --> 01:47:30.042
Only Ghanshyam is here.

01:47:32.458 --> 01:47:33.542
Another theatre crew?

01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:36.208
No! No!

01:47:37.875 --> 01:47:39.792
It is not safe to take any outsider.

01:47:41.125 --> 01:47:45.125
Apart from Ghanshyam, we need
three labourers.. another one..

01:47:46.167 --> 01:47:48.333
..an old lady.. she
is inside the house..

01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:50.250
..50, we need at least five people.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.250
If anything is changed drastically..

01:47:52.333 --> 01:47:53.917
..then Khurana will come to know.

01:47:55.125 --> 01:47:57.292
So, whatever we have to do, we
have to do it amongst ourselves.

01:48:00.542 --> 01:48:05.375
Papa, please give us the permission.

01:48:06.458 --> 01:48:07.792
It is our last chance.

01:48:24.292 --> 01:48:25.542
Bapu, it's the last chance.

01:48:32.083 --> 01:48:34.250
Mr. Sethi!
- Mr. Khurana!

01:48:34.333 --> 01:48:35.750
Sir, I made a mistake.
- No, no.

01:48:35.833 --> 01:48:36.917
Forgive me like your
younger brother.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.333
No, no. It is my fault.
- No. It's my fault. It's my fault.

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.500
No, no.
- Sir, it's my fault.

01:48:43.667 --> 01:48:46.583
If you found the offer less,
then you should have said so.

01:48:46.833 --> 01:48:48.583
It's okay. It's okay.

01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:50.250
That Satan Singh is
nowhere to be seen.

01:48:50.333 --> 01:48:52.333
Satan Singh!
- Insaan Singh!

01:48:52.833 --> 01:48:54.583
Insaan Singh!

01:48:58.292 --> 01:48:59.375
Insaan Singh.

01:49:04.833 --> 01:49:07.917
Greetings. Actually,
my mother is not well.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.750
She has given her
greetings from inside.

01:49:09.917 --> 01:49:11.417
I had one wish.

01:49:11.833 --> 01:49:14.833
Before the deal, I wanted to
visit the temple with you once.

01:49:14.917 --> 01:49:16.333
Let's go.
- What are you saying?

01:49:16.667 --> 01:49:17.750
I am not saying. He is saying it.

01:49:17.833 --> 01:49:18.917
He is saying it,
but you too understand.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.167
You are not saying anything.
- Is there a problem?

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:24.375
Tell me.

01:49:24.417 --> 01:49:27.167
Actually, Mr. Sethi had a
omelette in the morning.

01:49:27.250 --> 01:49:28.833
So, he can't visit the temple
after eating non-vegetarian food.

01:49:28.917 --> 01:49:30.833
That too on a big deal
like today.

01:49:33.083 --> 01:49:37.083
Forget it. The land is now mine.
We will go anytime.

01:49:37.167 --> 01:49:38.833
You get that buttermilk ready.

01:49:38.917 --> 01:49:40.833
I will have a round
with Insaan Singh.

01:49:40.917 --> 01:49:42.917
I will also come.
- Why are you taking the trouble?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.750
I have already troubled
you so much. Come, Mr. Satan.

01:49:47.417 --> 01:49:48.500
Come.

01:49:49.458 --> 01:49:50.542
Satan Singh!

01:49:55.667 --> 01:49:57.167
I can't see that girl.

01:49:57.833 --> 01:50:00.000
Sir, who?
- That..

01:50:00.583 --> 01:50:03.750
Greetings. Greetings.
- Greetings.

01:50:03.833 --> 01:50:04.917
Fool..

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.167
Papa, turn your face.

01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:12.958
Vijender is nowhere to be seen.

01:50:14.083 --> 01:50:18.000
That is better. Fool!

01:50:18.708 --> 01:50:20.708
What happened to the lady?
- Who?

01:50:21.708 --> 01:50:24.125
That lady.. Insaan Singh's mother.

01:50:24.208 --> 01:50:27.375
Old age!
- Old age!

01:50:27.542 --> 01:50:29.500
What's her name?

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.125
Chamchi..

01:50:33.208 --> 01:50:35.292
Katori?
- Katori!

01:50:35.542 --> 01:50:37.708
She has gone to her village.
Her father expired.

01:50:39.208 --> 01:50:41.792
Will she come back?
- Yes, why?

01:50:41.875 --> 01:50:43.417
Nothing.

01:50:43.625 --> 01:50:46.417
If you have some work,
then tell me, sir. Imarti is there.

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:49.292
Imarti?

01:50:50.167 --> 01:50:51.250
Imarti!

01:50:53.833 --> 01:50:54.917
What happened?

01:50:55.417 --> 01:50:58.917
She is her younger sister, sir.
She is very insolent!

01:50:59.167 --> 01:51:00.250
She has just
returned from the village.

01:51:00.333 --> 01:51:02.125
When she will come,
then she will go back.

01:51:03.292 --> 01:51:06.292
Can't both of them stay?
- Both? Why, sir?

01:51:07.292 --> 01:51:08.375
Nothing. Let's go.

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:14.958
Fool! Idiot!

01:51:17.167 --> 01:51:19.333
Sir, we have reached the well too.

01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:23.958
Sir, you want to take a bath?

01:51:26.625 --> 01:51:30.625
Is there water problem here?
- Problem? No, sir. Why?

01:51:30.708 --> 01:51:34.292
Let's go. Come on!
- Okay.

01:51:42.708 --> 01:51:43.875
It's cash in advance.

01:51:43.958 --> 01:51:45.042
Sir, buttermilk.

01:51:45.125 --> 01:51:47.958
I don't want buttermilk today.
Today, we will celebrate.

01:51:48.292 --> 01:51:50.042
Sir, I desire to sit with you.

01:51:50.125 --> 01:51:52.125
Let's go to the farmhouse.
We will have a drink.

01:51:53.083 --> 01:51:54.417
Sir, it's Friday today.
You can't drink.

01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:58.417
He had an omelette. Explain to him.
You are always objecting!

01:51:59.083 --> 01:52:00.500
Last time too you left suddenly.

01:52:01.458 --> 01:52:03.375
Sir, take the money.
Munjal, take this.

01:52:03.458 --> 01:52:04.708
Yes, sir. Whether you
take the money here or..

01:52:04.792 --> 01:52:05.958
..in the farmhouse,
it is one and the same thing.

01:52:06.042 --> 01:52:07.708
No! No!
- Come, sir!

01:52:07.792 --> 01:52:08.958
Sir, listen!

01:52:09.042 --> 01:52:11.042
He had an egg by mistake.

01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:13.292
He can't drink knowingly.

01:52:13.375 --> 01:52:15.708
Sir, it's Friday today!

01:52:15.792 --> 01:52:19.625
Some other day! Sir!

01:52:23.542 --> 01:52:24.708
Oh, God!

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:29.500
Get the Mercedes! Come on!

01:52:42.375 --> 01:52:43.458
What the hell are they doing?

01:52:44.375 --> 01:52:46.375
I don't know.
- Oh, God!

01:52:47.208 --> 01:52:54.208
"This is Khosla's nest."

01:52:54.542 --> 01:53:01.375
"See to it that it doesn't scatter."

01:53:02.042 --> 01:53:03.208
Let's follow them!

01:53:04.292 --> 01:53:05.958
Bunty, go home along with them!

01:53:06.042 --> 01:53:08.250
Wait for my call! Let's go, Asif!

01:53:26.292 --> 01:53:28.375
Dear, you haven't eaten
anything since morning.

01:53:28.458 --> 01:53:30.708
You were out since 6.
Shall I make something?

01:53:30.792 --> 01:53:31.875
No, Aunt.

01:53:32.292 --> 01:53:33.625
We should have taken
the money that day.

01:53:34.292 --> 01:53:35.958
That Khurana is a cunning man.

01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:37.125
I don't know what he is up to.

01:53:39.333 --> 01:53:41.583
I understood on the
first day itself..

01:53:41.667 --> 01:53:44.583
..that you are not
what you look like.

01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:48.083
Sir, it's very late.

01:53:48.417 --> 01:53:49.500
Keep quiet!

01:53:51.583 --> 01:53:53.917
Sir, your staff is so strange!

01:53:56.625 --> 01:53:58.542
There too he was
asking me to take a bath.

01:53:58.625 --> 01:54:00.792
What is this? What is this?

01:54:02.375 --> 01:54:05.208
And he has an objection
to each and everything.

01:54:06.708 --> 01:54:11.750
That day.. when you
got up and went away..

01:54:13.625 --> 01:54:15.625
..sir, I knew that you are great.

01:54:15.792 --> 01:54:19.542
Really! What is the
value of the land for you?

01:54:21.458 --> 01:54:23.792
Zero! Nothing! Zero!

01:54:25.292 --> 01:54:29.458
Even if I were to
take the money back..

01:54:31.708 --> 01:54:33.375
..it won't make a difference to you.

01:54:33.458 --> 01:54:35.458
What is 35 lakh!

01:54:38.417 --> 01:54:44.917
Mr. Sethi, you sold the land..

01:54:45.833 --> 01:54:47.417
I bought it. Am I right?

01:54:48.458 --> 01:54:49.542
Sir..

01:54:49.625 --> 01:54:53.917
I know it's late. Keep quiet!
Eat something!

01:54:55.875 --> 01:54:59.000
I'm very impressed!
I'm very impressed!

01:55:00.792 --> 01:55:02.958
Sir, do you know what my problem is?

01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:11.125
I still goof up. Sir, it's
because of keeping low-class company.

01:55:13.375 --> 01:55:18.208
And your secretary..
the way the talks to me..

01:55:19.417 --> 01:55:20.917
..I don't even talk
to myself in that way.

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:27.792
No, no. Very good!
- Thank you, sir.

01:55:31.042 --> 01:55:38.333
Sir, partnership. Partnership!

01:55:38.625 --> 01:55:41.292
Partnership, Mr. Sethi! Partnership!

01:55:41.375 --> 01:55:42.458
Hey!

01:55:45.458 --> 01:55:50.083
What's there in these coins?!
What's there?

01:55:50.667 --> 01:55:54.500
Mr. Sethi, you keep
sending me money from Dubai.

01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:57.083
And I will keep
buying properties here.

01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.667
Fine? Secretary!

01:55:59.833 --> 01:56:03.417
Then wait and watch what we do!

01:56:03.833 --> 01:56:09.250
Shopping complex..
housing complex.. multiplexes..

01:56:11.250 --> 01:56:13.750
..going carting.. and what's that?

01:56:14.333 --> 01:56:17.917
Bowling.
- We will do everything. Fine?

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.083
And you guys are coming tomorrow.
Mr. Sethi! For lunch!

01:56:22.458 --> 01:56:25.958
Then we will talk tomorrow! Okay!
Goodnight! Goodnight!

01:56:26.042 --> 01:56:29.625
Sir, cash.
- Very good! Very good! Very decent!

01:56:29.875 --> 01:56:32.375
No, I appreciate.
- Sir, cash. Cash.

01:56:34.708 --> 01:56:35.792
Thank you.

01:56:38.917 --> 01:56:40.417
Tomorrow. Goodnight!

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.500
Hey! Go straight and
take a right turn.

01:56:46.458 --> 01:56:49.458
Come on. Be careful. Carefully.

01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:55.083
Mr. Sethi.. goodnight.

01:56:55.583 --> 01:56:58.958
I will just come.
- Sir! Sir! Sir!

01:57:25.292 --> 01:57:26.375
Are they coming properly?

01:57:26.458 --> 01:57:28.958
Yes, they are coming.
Come on. Increase the speed.

01:57:34.833 --> 01:57:36.250
Brother Asif.
- Yes.

01:57:37.167 --> 01:57:38.250
Thank you.

01:57:38.583 --> 01:57:40.917
What are you saying, Brother Cherry!

01:57:48.250 --> 01:57:49.333
Hail the Goddess!

01:57:54.083 --> 01:57:55.250
Hail the Goddess!

01:57:58.792 --> 01:57:59.875
What is this?

01:58:00.125 --> 01:58:01.667
What do you think?

01:58:06.542 --> 01:58:08.542
Did you check it?
- Can I get water?

01:58:08.625 --> 01:58:09.958
Did you check it?
- Yes.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.417
Where's he? Call him.

01:58:18.792 --> 01:58:20.708
Not here. Let's go inside.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.083
Papa.

01:58:36.667 --> 01:58:37.750
We got the money.

01:58:48.792 --> 01:58:52.875
Get the plot back tomorrow.

01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:02.583
You too come along.

01:59:06.208 --> 01:59:07.958
Now, I can't do all this alone.

01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:17.500
Keep this in the safe.

01:59:44.625 --> 01:59:46.792
"What is love?"

01:59:47.208 --> 01:59:49.042
"What is it not?"

01:59:49.708 --> 01:59:54.042
"I didn't ask."

01:59:54.875 --> 01:59:58.875
"Are you mine or not."

01:59:58.958 --> 02:00:00.042
Hi.
- Hi.

02:00:00.125 --> 02:00:03.000
Where were you?
- I was changing.

02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:05.333
We got the money.

02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:10.583
I know. Good. I have to go.

02:00:10.667 --> 02:00:14.875
Shall I escort you?
- No, I have the scooter. Bye.

02:00:18.667 --> 02:00:20.083
Meghna!

02:00:30.208 --> 02:00:33.667
Mr. Khosla, you are great!
Take this.

02:00:34.292 --> 02:00:37.792
Very good! Very good!
Is he your other son? - Yes.

02:00:37.875 --> 02:00:38.958
Very good!

02:00:39.042 --> 02:00:40.125
What does he do?

02:00:42.167 --> 02:00:43.250
He's a software engineer.

02:00:43.333 --> 02:00:45.250
Very good! Very good!

02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:48.542
You are lucky. You have two sons.

02:00:49.708 --> 02:00:51.708
One is angry son and the
other one wears spectacles.

02:00:55.792 --> 02:00:57.042
We want to vacate the plot.

02:00:58.625 --> 02:01:00.875
Tell Ombir to evacuate.

02:01:00.958 --> 02:01:03.708
The plot is empty,
sir. Ombir is here, sir.

02:01:05.083 --> 02:01:09.000
Excellent! The plot is empty!

02:01:11.167 --> 02:01:12.250
Goodbye then.

02:01:14.250 --> 02:01:17.917
At least have sweets.
You have got the plot back.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.333
No! No!
- For my sake! Please!

02:01:20.417 --> 02:01:24.167
No, no. Please, Mr. Khurana.
I don't want it. Thank you.

02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:49.708
Papa! Papa, are you okay?
- I am fine.

02:01:50.125 --> 02:01:54.875
Are you sure?
- I was feeling giddy. I am okay.

02:01:57.375 --> 02:01:58.458
I am okay.

02:02:16.792 --> 02:02:19.208
Have you thought of a name?
- What?

02:02:21.792 --> 02:02:23.042
You wanted to change
your name, didn't you?

02:02:26.792 --> 02:02:28.042
You didn't get the time.

02:02:33.375 --> 02:02:34.625
So, when are you leaving?

02:02:37.542 --> 02:02:38.625
Where to?

02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:41.833
America. Where else?

02:02:44.792 --> 02:02:46.042
I don't know.

02:02:48.042 --> 02:02:50.125
It has been a long time
since I spoke to them.

02:02:52.583 --> 02:02:54.500
Anyway they were not paying well.

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.333
She's a nice girl.
- Who?

02:03:04.875 --> 02:03:09.208
Meghna. She is a nice girl.

02:03:13.708 --> 02:03:15.792
Hi.
- Hi.

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:25.917
Meghna, I am not going to New York.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.542
I am not going to New York.

02:03:34.917 --> 02:03:37.750
Are you doing a favour on me?
- Meghna.

02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:42.917
Today, you are not going.
You will go tomorrow.

02:03:43.458 --> 02:03:48.125
You are not going day after tomorrow.
It is not a joke to you.

02:03:51.292 --> 02:03:55.875
No, Meghna! I want to stay here.

02:04:00.375 --> 02:04:02.375
I need you!
- Just don't say anything!

02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.708
I love you, Meghna!
- Shut up!

02:04:13.125 --> 02:04:14.208
Meghna!

02:04:19.292 --> 02:04:21.125
"The night is so short."

02:04:21.792 --> 02:04:23.875
"There are so many things
to be said."

02:04:24.375 --> 02:04:26.542
"Now that you have come.”

02:04:26.875 --> 02:04:28.875
"I will tell you everything."

02:04:29.125 --> 02:04:33.542
"Please hold me just once."

02:04:34.833 --> 02:04:40.500
"Please hold me just once."

02:04:40.667 --> 02:04:43.000
"The wait.. the faith.."

02:04:43.083 --> 02:04:45.750
"Il love you too so much."

02:04:45.833 --> 02:04:47.917
"The wait.. the faith.."

02:04:48.083 --> 02:04:50.917
"Il love you too so much."

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.917
"The wait.. the faith.."

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.917
"Il love you too so much."

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.917
"The wait.. the faith.."

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:03.333
"Il love you too so much."

02:05:14.167 --> 02:05:16.000
Okay, now, one minute,
let's be serious. One minute!

02:05:16.833 --> 02:05:19.333
After giving Khurana 10 lakh
we have 25 left with us.

02:05:19.417 --> 02:05:21.833
Out of that, the
expenses were around 1 lakh.

02:05:22.417 --> 02:05:23.917
So, now, what do we
do with the rest?

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:26.667
I do not know anything about it.

02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:28.500
You don't ask me
anything about the money.

02:05:29.583 --> 02:05:31.667
So, if we divide this
money into three parts then..

02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:35.583
..brother Asif, you will get 8 lakh.

02:05:40.417 --> 02:05:42.750
Thank you!
- No, thank you!

02:05:44.042 --> 02:05:46.042
And Bapu, for your
theatre group, 8 lakh.

02:05:46.292 --> 02:05:47.542
No! 10 lakh!

02:05:47.625 --> 02:05:51.208
Hey, no! - Not for you, you smoke
your bidi (Indian cigarette).

02:05:51.542 --> 02:05:53.542
Our theatre company
does not run on water.

02:05:54.583 --> 02:05:57.250
A little money will
always be of help to us.

02:05:57.333 --> 02:05:58.417
Bapu, he is right!

02:06:00.250 --> 02:06:01.333
8 will be okay!

02:06:01.417 --> 02:06:03.667
Now what remains is our 8 lakh.

02:06:04.667 --> 02:06:06.125
What are we supposed
to do with that?

02:06:33.250 --> 02:06:36.583
Sir, the hotel guys are saying..

02:06:36.667 --> 02:06:41.833
..that no Sethi ever
came there from Dubai.

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:47.583
Phone.

02:06:47.667 --> 02:06:51.792
It's Dubai's cash card number.

02:06:55.417 --> 02:06:56.500
The plot.

02:06:57.083 --> 02:06:58.792
It belongs to the fisheries board.

02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:04.833
Just forget what happened.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.250
This matter should not
be leaked out.

02:07:14.417 --> 02:07:17.250
That somebody fooled Khurana.

02:07:31.167 --> 02:07:32.583
Now, you all do it properly please.

02:07:33.250 --> 02:07:36.917

"Cheer up, buddy."

02:08:21.833 --> 02:08:23.875
"Cheer up, buddy."

02:08:30.958 --> 02:08:33.625
"lI am telling you it is very sweet."

02:08:34.708 --> 02:08:37.542
"lI am telling you it is very sweet."

02:08:40.083 --> 02:08:42.375
"Deep breath, inhale."

02:08:42.417 --> 02:08:45.083
"Breath out. Breath. Inhale again."

02:08:46.375 --> 02:08:49.875
"This world is crazy.. where is
the hand, where is the leg.."

02:08:49.958 --> 02:08:53.542
"Its very crazy.."
