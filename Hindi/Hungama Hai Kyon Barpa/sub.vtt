00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.791
PLEASE DO NOT SPIT HERE

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:33.791
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.041
Just a…

00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:37.375
Yes?

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.916
It's him, right?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.875
Yes.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.458
You're Musafir Ali, right?

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.250
<i>They ask me who Ghalib is…</i>

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.750
<i>Someone tell them</i>
<i>For I know not who I am</i>

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:56.291
I'd recognize your voice anywhere.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.541
In '85, you had a concert
at Ravindra Bhavan.

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:02.666
Yes, yes…

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.958
I've been a fan ever since.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.000
I have all your albums.

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:10.833
Thank you for the kind words.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:13.875
Just one autograph, please?

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.583
Please.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:37.375
<i>This crazy heart of mine…</i>

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:42.500
<i>A lovesick rogue</i>

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:45.583
If life permits, we'll meet again.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.916
-Amen!
-Amen to that!

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:21.083
Ladies and gentlemen…

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:26.208
On this blessed journey
from Bhopal to Delhi…

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:28.666
I, Musafir Ali,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.666
humbly welcome your presence.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.750
I would like to begin
this beautiful evening

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.791
with a couplet by the great Ahmad Faraz.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:11.458
-Let's hear it!
-Here goes…

00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:15.041
<i>Some find their destination</i>
<i>A step away from home…</i>

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.000
Wonderful! Wonderful!

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:21.416
<i>Some find their destination</i>
<i>A step away from home…</i>

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.000
<i>For others, like myself</i>
<i>All life is spent in journey</i>

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.208
Bravo! Bravo!

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.083
Sorry… Careful…

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.458
It moved suddenly… Please sit.

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:09.291
Hello. Myself Aslam Baig.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.125
Musafir Ali.

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:14.416
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.083
It feels like I have…

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.708
Yes, even I feel like…

00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.750
-We've met before.
-But where?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.041
My cousin's wedding in Gajraula--

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:26.083
At Ravindra Bhavan.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:29.708
No, I've never been there.

00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:31.708
Then where?

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:42.833
Shadaab sir…

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:46.208
Mr. Shadaab…

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:50.666
Shadaab sir, from Bhopal housing board!

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.333
No, no, you are mistaken.

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:56.833
-I am sure.
-I have no connection with Bhopal.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:59.041
I came here
for a printing press conference.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:01.375
Brother, no more jokes.

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.083
Swear to God, my name is not Shadaab.

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.125
Really!

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.416
-Really?
-Yes.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.958
Anyway, the boundless voyage
will defog our memories.

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:12.958
The what?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.000
The boundless voyage.

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.166
Meaning, the long journey
will jog our memories.

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:22.208
I see…

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:24.708
Now you're speaking Urdu.

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:27.666
Come in.

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.166
Pardon me, sir.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.583
It's you, isn't it?

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:45.083
<i>It was a full moon night</i>

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:46.750
<i>They looked at the skies</i>

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:48.958
<i>And spoke of you</i>

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:55.041
From blankets to booze,
anything you need, I'm your man.

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:58.083
-Thank you.
-For now, tea will do. Milk separate.

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:01.166
-I'll be right back, sir.
-Okay.

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:04.625
<i>It was a full moon night…</i>

00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.625
So it's you! The cassette guy.

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.958
My wife is a big fan of yours.

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:17.166
She listens to your songs all day.
What was it…

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.333
<i>I drank in the toilet…</i>

00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:21.416
From the goblet.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.083
-Same thing.
-It's not, sir.

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:27.666
Goblet is meant for wine,
toilet is for urine.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.833
Either way, it's your voice, right?

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:33.708
Even I pour myself a rum
and listen to that one.

00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:38.750
<i>I stumble and drink</i>

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.166
<i>I fumble…</i>

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.583
"I drink to escape the rancor of life…"

00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:48.458
"I drink to forget
the ink-stained black night."

00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:54.166
As long as all roads
lead to a drink, I'm happy.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.625
It's my favorite ghazal.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.000
You're not alone, my friend.

00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:00.166
Even the maestro
Ghulam Ali loves this song.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.583
Wow.

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:03.625
When he heard me live in Delhi,

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.208
he came backstage and gave me a warm hug.

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:10.458
And then the maestro himself

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:15.916
took off his ring and gave it to me.

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.708
Ghulam Ali,
the Pakistani fast bowler, right?

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:29.416
He's got a beautiful outswing.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.875
I don't know about outswing,

00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:38.375
but his voice swings in beautifully.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.500
Anyway, glad to meet you.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.791
The wife will be delighted
to hear about this.

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.000
She'll be green with envy.

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:48.750
Come in.

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.541
{\an8}Keep it here.

00:08:57.208 --> 00:08:59.125
INDIAN WRESTLING WEEKLY

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:25.208
This…

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.333
-Yes?
-What is this?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.541
Chai Noomi Basra.

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:34.375
Chai Noomi?

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:35.916
Arabian tea.

00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:40.125
You put a few pieces
of dried lime in the tea.

00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:42.166
Want to try?

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.250
Have some.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Try it.

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:50.458
My mother drank it all the time.

00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:53.458
I picked up the habit as well.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.750
Try it?

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.333
Try. Don't hesitate.

00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.708
What're you doing, my friend?

00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:10.041
-This is not a coaster.
-I'm sorry.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:13.291
This is the most popular
wrestling magazine of India.

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:14.458
Really sorry.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.666
-Seems you're not a wrestling fan.
-No, no.

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:20.541
Not at all.

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:23.583
But you love it, obviously.

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.208
Ever heard of the name Jenga?

00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:29.125
Jenga?

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.125
The Hercules of Patparganj…

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.583
Lion of Karkardooma,
Jenga the Wrestler.

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:38.041
The only wrestling I do is with my tunes.

00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:42.500
Physical wrestling I haven't encountered.

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:44.166
Yet…

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:46.666
-That was my name.
-I see.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.083
How do they say it in your circles…

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:52.875
-Synonym?
-Pseudo… Pseudonym.

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.833
Exactly, it was my nickname.

00:10:56.708 --> 00:10:58.416
I became Baig later.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.416
The world knew me as Jenga the Wrestler.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.458
I see.

00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:07.916
From Delhi to Agra,
people spoke of my "Powerslam."

00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:11.958
But time, my friend…

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:14.875
is a cold-hearted bitch.

00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:20.583
It turns like the tide
and takes your life with it.

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:25.750
But don't you dare think

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:29.500
that because it's been ten years,
Jenga won't recognize you.

00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:34.583
I know your kind very well.

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:35.958
I recognized you instantly.

00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:39.125
You stole a piece of my heart.

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:41.541
Robbed me of my destiny.

00:11:41.625 --> 00:11:43.750
My destiny, you son of a bitch!

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:44.833
Motherfu…

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:53.041
I'll be right back.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.875
Ladies and gentlemen…

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:39.375
This is the same gentleman…

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:46.833
whose Khusbakht I stole ten years ago.

00:12:48.916 --> 00:12:51.375
Oh, precious Khusbakht.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:13:00.000
If you're thinking that's the name
of his daughter or his wife, you're wrong.

00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:04.500
Nor do I have the audacity
for such a transgression.

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:09.458
Alas, Khusbakht…

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.500
is the name of his watch.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:16.000
And that watch…

00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:20.166
A beauty of a watch.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.791
God forbid, if Baig recalls that incident,

00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.291
then, no matter.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.541
Just a threat to my life.

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:37.166
But I am not the man I was ten years ago.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:41.625
Back then,
I suffered from an incurable disease.

00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:47.041
What was the damn disease called?

00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:49.291
Can't remember.

00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:52.500
It's like they say…

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:58.541
<i>Who was once the object</i>
<i>Of all my thoughts, now I can't recall</i>

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:03.625
<i>The name of that infernal ailment</i>
<i>Now I can't recall</i>

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:06.750
Wonderful! Bravo!

00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:47.583
-A-6?
-Hello.

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:51.875
Myself Aslam Baig.

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:57.083
Raju Shahwani.

00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:02.875
Raju, my friend,
care for some Chai Noomi Basra?

00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:04.750
Chai what?

00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:06.833
Noomi Basra.

00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:08.375
Arabian tea, my friend.

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:10.291
Hey, this…

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.500
You put a few pieces
of dried lime in the tea.

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:15.625
Try it.

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:16.916
Have some.

00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.166
-No?
-Thank you.

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:29.583
What do you do?

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:32.291
-I try.
-Try what?

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:34.875
Let's put it this way.

00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:40.541
I stagger in the desert in search
of a mirage called employment.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.916
-You're looking for a job, right?
-Yes.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.166
Then why are you in the desert?

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.208
Try the city, they're a dime a dozen.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.583
Mr. Baig,
the city is a desert, too, isn't it?

00:15:53.208 --> 00:15:54.250
I see.

00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:57.375
My friend…

00:15:58.208 --> 00:15:59.541
-You see this ear?
-Yes.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.625
You hold it like this, right?

00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.791
You can't hold it like this.

00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:08.333
You won't find a job.

00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:09.875
I'm speaking from experience.

00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:13.791
Thank you.

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.500
{\an8}A COLLECTION OF MY POETRY

00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.708
<i>Let the cloud burst</i>
<i>Let the wine flow</i>

00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:33.250
<i>After that</i>
<i>Whatever punishment may come</i>

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:40.833
INDIAN WRESTLING WEEKLY

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.291
-Mr. Baig…
-Yes?

00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:44.625
What do you do?

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:51.333
-Press.
-Press?

00:16:51.416 --> 00:16:54.291
Sports journalism.
I write about wrestling.

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:58.750
I could tell from your magazine
that you're a wrestling fan.

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:01.166
"Fan" is hardly the word, my friend.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.583
It is my obsession.

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:04.250
-Really?
-Yes.

00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:07.666
Ever heard of the name Jenga?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.625
What?

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.208
Hercules of Patparganj,

00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:13.916
Lion of Karkardooma,
Jenga the Wrestler.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.708
Sir, I'm a man of poetry and music.

00:17:17.791 --> 00:17:21.541
I'm not very familiar with wrestlers.

00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:25.125
I became Baig later.

00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:29.625
The world knew me as Jenga.

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:31.166
-Really?
-Yes.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.416
From Delhi to Agra,
there was talk of my "Powerslam."

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.750
I see.

00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:42.833
So how come you switched
from wrestling to journalism?

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:45.041
Thanks to
the King of the Jungle, Dara Singh.

00:17:46.083 --> 00:17:47.416
-Really?
-Yes.

00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:50.958
I had a match with him.

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:54.416
He entered the ring and I thought
there was a skyscraper in front of me.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.250
I looked closely,
and saw no doors or windows.

00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:01.416
Then I realized it was a human being.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.541
Then?

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:07.083
I took him for a man,
but he didn't take me for one.

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:08.041
Meaning?

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:11.250
He probably took me for a lady's skirt.

00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:13.208
-Skirt?
-Yes.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.791
What are you saying, Mr. Baig?

00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:18.875
The way a washerman
slams a skirt on a rock.

00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.000
Well, Dara Singh slammed me in the ring.

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:25.083
That was the sound.

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:27.666
Cracked my spine.
And I was a wrestler no more.

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.458
But the bug never left.

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:34.083
<i>It doesn't leave, my friend</i>

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.125
<i>Once you've tasted it</i>

00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:39.291
Yes, something like that.

00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:42.541
Wonderful, wonderful.

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.625
-Mr. Baig.
-Yes?

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.333
Time is like a steam iron.

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:52.083
It gradually removes
all the creases of grief.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.875
No, no…

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.625
Time isn't like an iron.

00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:00.458
Time is like a woman.

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.666
Beautiful.

00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.875
They call it Khusbakht.

00:19:25.583 --> 00:19:27.583
No less than a beautiful woman.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.875
My God!

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:32.708
The secret is…

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.416
It doesn't just tell the time,

00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:39.041
it changes it.

00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:47.083
<i>I shall keep the secrets</i>

00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:50.333
<i>You hide in your eyes</i>

00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:57.083
<i>Should I recover</i>
<i>I would rather pretend I am in paradise</i>

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:04.375
<i>Although I'm yet asleep</i>
<i>My sweet bearer of wine</i>

00:20:04.458 --> 00:20:09.375
<i>Undeserving, though, I am</i>
<i>This intoxication is no fault of mine</i>

00:20:12.416 --> 00:20:16.208
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.625
With a cracked spine,

00:20:55.666 --> 00:21:00.250
Jenga the Wrestler
was knocked down by life.

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:03.125
Wine replaced milk
as his choice of drink.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:09.250
And in that difficult time,
this Khusbakht…

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:11.541
came into my life.

00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:14.208
I said, "My life!"

00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:15.791
Control yourself!

00:21:17.458 --> 00:21:21.125
Khusbakht turned my time around.

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.291
Showed me a new path.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I got into sports journalism.

00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:29.333
And then…

00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:33.416
life started getting back on track.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.833
Mr. Baig…

00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:45.375
If the great Gulzar
were here, he would have said…

00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:49.500
<i>It tells time but is not a timepiece</i>
<i>For it is a piece of my heart</i>

00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:10.375
My friend, where…

00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:12.583
Some idiot has pulled the brake chain.

00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:15.083
It's the outskirts. I'll go check it out.

00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:18.875
I'll start packing as well.
The station's just two minutes away.

00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.333
Fine, fine.

00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:40.916
What happened?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.041
It's arrived…

00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:45.083
Who's arrived?

00:23:45.833 --> 00:23:47.208
Station.

00:23:47.291 --> 00:23:50.000
You look as if the apocalypse has arrived.

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:56.583
Mr. Baig, you're too much.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.875
Wait!

00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:13.958
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:15.750
What?

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.583
Did not expect this from you.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:23.500
No goodbye, no farewell,
you're just going to walk away like that?

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:32.208
See you.

00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:34.291
-Goodbye. What a strange man.
-Goodbye.

00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:36.208
Excuse me.

00:25:28.458 --> 00:25:29.875
Open your eyes.

00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:32.958
Eyeballs left to right.

00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:35.000
Good.

00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.208
Okay.

00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:43.833
So you saw the watch and swiped it.

00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:45.541
Yes.

00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:46.791
Now tell me,

00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:49.625
there is a thing called "Fear of God."

00:25:49.708 --> 00:25:50.708
Didn't you feel it?

00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:55.791
This stealing incident,
was this a first,

00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:59.041
or have you pulled such heists before?

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.583
My friend, take your words out of exile

00:26:03.666 --> 00:26:06.958
and speak the truth.
You will feel lighter.

00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:10.166
Doctor…

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.541
once…

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.208
Once or twice.

00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:18.958
Once or twice?

00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:22.125
My friend,

00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:28.166
you should never lie to your lover,
your priest and your doctor.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.791
If you do, then on the day of reckoning,

00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:36.416
the devil will whip your ass
until you're frothing at the mouth.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.541
Get it?

00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:39.000
What will he do?

00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:41.333
Whip my ass.

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:42.375
Whip your…

00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:43.458
Ass.

00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:45.750
Now spill the truth.

00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:51.416
I spent my childhood in Koh-e-Fiza.

00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:56.083
Father's financial situation
was less than ideal.

00:26:57.041 --> 00:26:59.125
I never got any toys.

00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:05.250
The first time I laid eyes
on my friend's Dancing Monkey,

00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:07.416
I was spellbound.

00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:11.250
<i>He had many toys.</i>

00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:15.208
<i>"One less monkey</i>
<i>won't make a difference to him,"</i>

00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:17.625
<i>is what I thought.</i>

00:27:22.166 --> 00:27:26.458
<i>I had other friends.</i>
<i>They had other animals.</i>

00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:29.833
<i>The jungle kept growing.</i>

00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:34.875
<i>At first, I would feel bad.</i>

00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:37.166
<i>But then it became a habit.</i>

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.916
<i>Sometimes it occurred</i>
<i>to me that this is wrong…</i>

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.166
<i>"I'll stop tomorrow."</i>

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:48.500
<i>But the next day, my hands</i>
<i>would pick up something again.</i>

00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:53.083
<i>As if my own hands were out of my control.</i>

00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:57.000
<i>At other times,</i>
<i>I felt as if this was my talent,</i>

00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:59.041
<i>and therefore it was my right to steal.</i>

00:28:02.208 --> 00:28:04.916
My friend, tell me something.

00:28:06.416 --> 00:28:08.166
Do you feel shame?

00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:13.083
Yes. Very much.

00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:16.416
Then consider yourself cured.

00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:20.125
This disease has a very difficult name.

00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:21.041
Right.

00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:27.166
What Rajesh Khanna had in the film <i>Anand,</i>
that had a more difficult name.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.666
-This is easier.
-What's the name?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.083
This grievous ailment is called…
Say it with me.

00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:36.166
-Ki-le-pato…
-Ke-le-pato…

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.666
-Not "Kele," "Ki-le."
-Ki-le-pato…

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.500
-Ki-le-pato…
-Ki-le-pato…

00:28:40.583 --> 00:28:42.208
-Maa-ni-ya.
-Ma-ni-ya.

00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:44.291
-Not "Ma-ni-ya," "Maa-ni-ya."
-Maa-ni-ya.

00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:46.666
-Kilepato-maaniya.
-Kilepato-maaniya.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.291
-Say it in full.
-"It in full."

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:50.583
The full name, my friend.

00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:52.708
-Kilepato-maaniya.
-Yes, yes…

00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:54.458
This is what you have.

00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:56.625
Is there a remedy?

00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:58.666
-Absolutely.
-Please tell me.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.583
Substitute this ailment with another.

00:29:01.666 --> 00:29:03.083
Another ailment?

00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:04.833
You have the stealing disease.

00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:10.291
If you were to replace this
with the disease of music,

00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:12.166
you would be cured.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.166
You sing well, don't you?

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.791
Once you catch this bug,
the other will disappear.

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.458
Now, come here.

00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:20.541
Yes?

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.833
Why do you walk around
looking like a priest?

00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:24.833
You've got to sing for an audience.

00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:29.625
A sharp moustache like Mehdi Hassan.
Sharp as a blade!

00:29:29.708 --> 00:29:31.625
And you call this a shirt?

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:35.791
Get one of those fancy silk shirts
like Ghulam Ali.

00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:38.416
With bright colors.
And this bloody name… "Raju"?

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.916
Sounds like the name of a shrimp seller.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.666
Get an elegant, poetic name.
What'll it be?

00:29:47.958 --> 00:29:49.250
How's "Musafir"?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.041
Straight to the heart… Musafir.

00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:58.416
Musafir Ali.

00:30:01.583 --> 00:30:03.750
Please listen to this Urdu couplet.

00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:06.958
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:30:07.916 --> 00:30:11.833
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.791
<i>Why the chaos…</i>

00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:20.000
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:30:20.083 --> 00:30:24.541
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:26.125
Bravo! Wonderful!

00:30:26.208 --> 00:30:30.416
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.500
<i>For I have had just a harmless drink</i>

00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:38.583
<i>Not a bandit</i>

00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:42.458
<i>Not a bandit</i>

00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:46.333
<i>And neither am I a thief</i>

00:30:46.416 --> 00:30:50.583
<i>Why the chaos, friends?</i>

00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:54.166
<i>For I have had just a harmless drink</i>

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:37.000
<i>Worthless is the wine</i>

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:41.416
<i>Which is a stranger to the heart</i>

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.208
<i>I seek only the wine</i>

00:31:45.291 --> 00:31:49.000
<i>Which springs from my own heart</i>

00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:53.375
<i>Why is there such a noise?</i>

00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:57.083
<i>For I have had just a harmless drink</i>

00:31:58.125 --> 00:31:59.125
Excuse me!

00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:03.000
Mr. Musafir!

00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:05.666
Hello! What's the time?

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.208
Mr. Musafir!

00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:08.583
What time is it?

00:32:08.666 --> 00:32:11.166
What's the time? Hello!

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.583
Mr. Musafir?

00:32:12.666 --> 00:32:14.541
Time, what's the time?

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:17.875
What time have you got?

00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.416
9:00.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.875
HMT?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.458
Even I had an HMT.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.791
It broke this morning.

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.750
Actually…

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:36.875
I'm unlucky when it comes to watches.

00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:39.583
You know…

00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:42.166
I used to have a priceless watch.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.458
Khusbakht.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.541
It was stolen.

00:32:49.083 --> 00:32:53.125
Ten years ago I was in a train
compartment like this one,

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:54.625
and this bastard…

00:32:58.375 --> 00:33:00.500
Do you know what "Khusbakht" means?

00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:01.875
Lucky.

00:33:01.958 --> 00:33:03.375
I see.

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:09.250
You could say that the thief
didn't just steal my watch,

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.791
he stole my luck with it.

00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:12.875
Lost my job.

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:15.291
Articles started getting rejected and…

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:18.791
The wife wanted a child.

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:22.083
But even after several attempts…

00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:27.208
It felt like along with the watch,

00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:29.791
I lost my manhood as well.

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:37.875
Why did that scoundrel steal my watch?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.166
I still haven't forgotten his face.

00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:48.375
His face haunts me night and day.

00:33:48.458 --> 00:33:51.500
I swear to God, if I ever see him,

00:33:51.583 --> 00:33:54.625
I will tear his jaw with my bare hands.

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:27.666
What happened? Do you have asthma?

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.083
Just a second…

00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:33.916
Here, drink this.

00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:42.083
Put some black cumin in milk and drink it.

00:34:42.166 --> 00:34:43.666
It's good for asthma.

00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:45.666
Thank you.

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:47.625
-You're okay?
-Yes.

00:34:51.083 --> 00:34:52.333
The thing is…

00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:56.291
I know about your ailment.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.125
You…

00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:04.958
You know?

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:06.416
Yes.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.625
And I know the remedy as well.

00:35:11.583 --> 00:35:12.458
What?

00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:14.541
I'll show you…

00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:16.166
What're you looking for?

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:18.958
Dagger!

00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.416
Dagger?

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.333
Goes straight to the heart!

00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:24.875
Remedy for every ailment.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.041
<i>I stumble and drink, I fumble and drink…</i>

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.166
Cheers!

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:44.750
Mr. Musafir…

00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:48.500
this was the quarter-final.

00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:51.166
-Now, semifinal.
-Sure.

00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:56.333
So I was saying

00:35:56.416 --> 00:35:58.583
that in my wrestling days,

00:35:58.666 --> 00:36:00.958
I used to do a lot of weight training.

00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:04.208
So that my arms would be strong.

00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:06.666
Chest would be strong.

00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:08.666
Human beings,

00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:13.583
we take such good care of our bodies.

00:36:13.666 --> 00:36:15.333
We try so hard.

00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:19.666
But… what about the soul?

00:36:20.458 --> 00:36:22.125
If only…

00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:25.250
If there were exercises for the soul,

00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:27.583
I'd do them, too.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.208
When a man robs another

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:37.541
of his favorite, priceless object,

00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:42.333
then doesn't he deserve

00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:45.625
to be cursed for his entire life?

00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:48.958
Yes, he does.

00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:51.875
Does he ever feel bad about it?

00:36:51.958 --> 00:36:54.083
He does.

00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:57.125
He feels terrible.

00:36:58.166 --> 00:37:00.333
Perhaps he is a good man inside,

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.791
and his circumstances are bad.

00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:06.500
Mr. Musafir, blaming
circumstances for our mistakes

00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:08.583
is a typical Indian trait.

00:37:08.666 --> 00:37:12.791
It's also possible
that he caught the stealing disease

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.083
in his childhood.

00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:18.333
-Disease?
-Yes, this is a kind of disease.

00:37:18.416 --> 00:37:19.708
Okay, it is!

00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:22.666
But there is a thing
called conscience. Conscience!

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.166
Somewhere in the narrow alleys
of his conscience,

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.333
he can find a place to cleanse his soul.

00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:31.583
What do you call it…

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:34.083
-Atonement.
-Yes, can't he do that?

00:37:34.166 --> 00:37:38.000
Of course he can,
you are absolutely right. But…

00:37:38.083 --> 00:37:41.750
What if he is afraid
of confessing his sins?

00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:46.208
-Then… there is only one remedy.
-What?

00:37:49.875 --> 00:37:50.958
A beating.

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:56.291
And we wrestlers
know how to give a beating.

00:37:56.375 --> 00:37:58.458
I am very good at it.

00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:02.250
Get him in a headlock. No eye contact…

00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:04.375
Fine, have it your way.

00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:06.083
You win, I lose.

00:38:07.208 --> 00:38:08.208
Okay.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.916
Deliver your beating. Guilty as charged.

00:38:14.958 --> 00:38:17.416
Give you a beating for what?

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.416
Since you're so very eager
to give a beating.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.416
Go on. I must have sinned, too.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.625
-So, go ahead.
-I love you!

00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:29.916
Take out your frustration. Punish me!

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Okay.

00:38:32.916 --> 00:38:34.166
Your…

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.125
punishment is…

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.333
Bottoms up.

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:48.458
Mr. Baig.

00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:50.208
As you wish.

00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:53.125
One…

00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:55.083
Two…

00:38:56.166 --> 00:38:57.083
Three.

00:38:57.166 --> 00:38:58.083
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:39:13.083 --> 00:39:14.333
<i>Mr. Musafir.</i>

00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:17.125
<i>They call it "Khusbakht."</i>

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.250
<i>Mr. Musafir?</i>

00:39:21.208 --> 00:39:22.416
Mr. Musafir?

00:39:23.625 --> 00:39:25.458
-Mr. Musafir?
-What?

00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:27.666
Return Mr. Baig's watch.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:28.916
What did you say?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.708
Nothing. I said your tea is ready.
Please have it.

00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:34.750
Delhi arrives in ten minutes.

00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:35.958
Mr. Baig?

00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:37.500
He's in the washroom.

00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.166
He's got indigestion.

00:40:17.708 --> 00:40:21.083
<i>I stumble and drink, I fumble…</i>

00:40:31.666 --> 00:40:33.583
What's going on here?

00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:35.291
What?

00:40:35.375 --> 00:40:37.791
-That's my bag.
-Yes.

00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:40.666
What's in your hand?

00:40:41.708 --> 00:40:44.791
In my hand? My hand… My fingers.

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.583
Take out your hand.

00:40:46.666 --> 00:40:47.958
Why?

00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:49.291
What're you doing?

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:53.083
This…

00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:56.833
Mr. Baig…

00:40:58.333 --> 00:40:59.750
I apologize.

00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.458
Ten years ago,

00:41:02.541 --> 00:41:05.958
that lousy, dishonest,

00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:10.125
despicable man…

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.583
was me.

00:41:16.333 --> 00:41:20.458
I stole your Khusbakht from you.

00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:28.833
Mr. Baig,

00:41:29.916 --> 00:41:33.083
if it was about money,
I'd have simply compensated you,

00:41:33.166 --> 00:41:38.000
but I stole your good fortune from you.

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:45.916
But I was not born a scoundrel, Mr. Baig.

00:41:47.083 --> 00:41:51.125
I caught the stealing disease in my youth…

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:53.791
but now I am free of it.

00:41:55.625 --> 00:42:01.458
The doctor had told me
the name of this strange disease…

00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:07.916
Now I can't remember.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.250
Mr. Baig.

00:42:10.125 --> 00:42:13.541
Your sinner stands before you.

00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.666
As the remedy for this disease,

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.291
or as punishment for my sins,

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:25.458
I accept all the beatings
you wish to give me.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.500
Go ahead.

00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:35.833
Mr. Baig.

00:42:36.875 --> 00:42:38.000
Mr. Baig?

00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:45.958
Here.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.041
Take it.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.625
It belongs to you.

00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:08.125
Forgive me if you can.

00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:09.833
-What?
-Yes.

00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:48.875
Raju!

00:43:48.958 --> 00:43:50.416
Raju, my friend!

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.833
Mr. Musafir?

00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:53.166
Hey, Mr. Musafir!

00:43:59.916 --> 00:44:01.708
What's this, Mr. Baig?

00:44:02.958 --> 00:44:06.041
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m., go to Old Delhi.

00:44:06.125 --> 00:44:09.291
Qasim Jan lane, Ballimaran street.

00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:10.708
Where Ghalib's mansion is?

00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:15.416
Don't know about that,
but there is a Ghalib snack shop there.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.833
Adjacent is a pawn shop, Rooh Safa.

00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:20.875
Give it there. Farewell.

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:22.541
But, Mr. Baig?

00:44:23.458 --> 00:44:26.583
Madam, please excuse me.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.833
Wonderful! Amazing!

00:44:30.916 --> 00:44:33.958
-It's amazing, isn't it?
-Encore.

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:36.208
GHALIB SNACK SHOP

00:44:36.291 --> 00:44:40.958
SOUL CLEANSE

00:44:51.583 --> 00:44:52.458
Greetings.

00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:54.416
Greetings to you as well.

00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:09.208
Name?

00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:11.541
They call me Musafir.

00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:12.875
No, no…

00:45:12.958 --> 00:45:14.958
Name of the person you stole this from.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:20.000
This is stolen, right?

00:45:20.083 --> 00:45:22.166
Sure you're at the right place?

00:45:22.833 --> 00:45:25.458
-No, nothing like that…
-Embarrassed?

00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:26.791
First time here?

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:29.625
Look, my friend,

00:45:29.708 --> 00:45:32.250
this isn't a shop, it's a bath.

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.333
And in a bath…

00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:36.041
-Everybody stands naked.
-Absolutely right!

00:45:36.125 --> 00:45:40.041
So leave your coat of honor outside.

00:45:40.625 --> 00:45:41.625
-Jumman!
-Yes?

00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:42.958
Keep this inside.

00:45:46.791 --> 00:45:49.500
So you buy and sell stolen things?

00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:51.208
Never!

00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:54.291
You think this is a pawn shop?

00:45:54.375 --> 00:45:58.500
We don't buy anything.
People hand them over on their own.

00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:01.000
-On their own?
-Please sit.

00:46:02.083 --> 00:46:03.250
Thank you.

00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:06.333
-There's a disease…
-Yes.

00:46:06.416 --> 00:46:07.666
Ke…

00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:12.291
Which makes a person steal.
It has a strange name.

00:46:12.375 --> 00:46:14.541
Jumman, what's that disease called? Ke…

00:46:14.625 --> 00:46:16.375
-Kleptomania.
-Yes!

00:46:16.458 --> 00:46:18.166
This…

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.916
I have the same disease.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.208
You're not alone.
Great men have had this disease.

00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:25.500
Who?

00:46:26.375 --> 00:46:27.750
William Shakespeare.

00:46:27.833 --> 00:46:29.333
Bahadur Shah Zafar.

00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:31.750
-And our very own Dada Muni.
-Really?

00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:35.541
Even if I'm lying,
it's not like you're going to go ask them.

00:46:36.583 --> 00:46:37.583
They are no more!

00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:42.541
One thing still puzzles me.

00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:46.375
Why do they return
their stolen things here?

00:46:46.458 --> 00:46:47.500
Self-respect.

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:51.000
The bite of conscience.

00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:56.208
Whatever sins a man may commit,
he is, after all, a child of God.

00:46:58.166 --> 00:46:59.583
Look at that.

00:46:59.666 --> 00:47:02.416
Someone turned in
Wajid Ali Shah's chillum.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.500
Someone dropped off
Lord Mountbatten's pajamas.

00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:06.625
And over there,

00:47:06.708 --> 00:47:10.583
Satyajit Ray's stolen short stories,
lying right there.

00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:11.958
-Satyajit Ray?
-Yes, over there!

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.041
Now, you tell me.

00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:16.708
Whom did you steal the watch from?

00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:18.625
Someone…

00:47:18.708 --> 00:47:24.625
If you don't give me his name,
your soul remains blemished.

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:27.416
Simply washing
your hands of it won't suffice.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.708
Baig… Aslam Baig.

00:47:30.708 --> 00:47:32.000
-Baig?
-Yes.

00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:33.083
Jenga the Wrestler?

00:47:33.166 --> 00:47:35.208
Right, Jenga the Wrestler.

00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:36.958
-Lion of Karkardooma?
-Yes, the Lion.

00:47:37.041 --> 00:47:38.791
-Hercules of Patparganj?
-Yes, Patparganj…

00:47:39.375 --> 00:47:44.458
Like the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
with a little tilt?

00:47:44.541 --> 00:47:45.875
Yes, he's a little askew.

00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:50.541
He's a regular client.

00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:55.208
He was a good wrestler,
but that same disease…

00:47:55.291 --> 00:47:56.375
Kele… whatever…

00:47:56.458 --> 00:48:00.250
Jumman, get Jenga's stuff.

00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:03.375
Look at this.

00:48:04.791 --> 00:48:06.166
Look.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.791
This was Dara Singh's medal.

00:48:09.416 --> 00:48:12.208
The idiot stole this. Now, tell me.

00:48:12.291 --> 00:48:16.333
Who tries to steal a lion's mane?

00:48:16.416 --> 00:48:19.541
Dara Singh slammed him on the ground and…

00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:20.791
"Kadaak" was the sound.

00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:25.083
-Yes. You were there, too?
-No, no, I wasn't.

00:48:25.166 --> 00:48:28.458
But I know what that sound feels like.

00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:31.958
Alas, that's why
Jenga had to quit wrestling.

00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:33.833
And here, check this out.

00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:36.125
See this?

00:48:37.708 --> 00:48:39.458
Maestro Ghulam Ali's ring.

00:48:43.375 --> 00:48:45.541
He handed it over yesterday.

00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:50.041
Yesterday?

00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:52.250
Straight from the station?

00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:55.833
Ghulam Ali's ring, just imagine!

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:59.166
He's hit the big time.

00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:06.500
<i>I've never been in love</i>
<i>with stolen things.</i>

00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:11.375
<i>Now, you might ask why I returned</i>
<i>my Khusbakht to Musafir.</i>

00:49:11.458 --> 00:49:17.083
<i>It's because I was never able to give it</i>
<i>to Rooh Safa myself.</i>

00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.000
<i>Yes.</i>

00:49:18.916 --> 00:49:21.875
<i>And today, after ten years,</i>
<i>when I saw Khusbakht,</i>

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:24.416
<i>I was tempted once again.</i>

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.791
-Lamp shade…
<i>-Then the thought occurred that…</i>

00:49:26.875 --> 00:49:30.375
<i>Musafir is also from the same family,</i>
<i>of the same tribe as I am.</i>

00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:32.291
Lamp… Rooh Safa.

00:49:33.291 --> 00:49:35.333
-Rooh Safa?
-Rooh Safa?

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:43.208
<i>And if we all deserve</i>
<i>a chance to atone for our sins,</i>

00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:46.333
<i>then why not poor Musafir Ali?</i>

00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:51.083
<i>Over just a harmless drink</i>

00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.916
<i>Over just a harmless drink</i>

00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:05.250
A FEW GHAZALS
