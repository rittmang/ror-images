WEBVTT

00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:53.548
There are 10 '0s' in 5000 crores.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.688
Your brother will need a lifetime
to return that kind of money.

00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:02.688
Tell him to spend 5-years
behind bars instead.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.359
It'll be over before he knows it.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.061
Why return them when he didn't take it?

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.743
Where are these 5000 crores?

00:02:09.217 --> 00:02:10.241
Did you find them?

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:14.599
Look, sir,
I think he shouldn't go to jail at all.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:17.807
Your brother has changed
the entire scenario of the city.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.861
But look...

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:22.776
It's all too clear.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.464
We won't go to jail at any cost.

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:27.949
Whatever it takes.

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:30.320
We've more money than God.

00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:34.784
Even you know
that it's no longer in our control.

00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:37.265
- We've orders from the top.
- The top?

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.461
Where were you two a year ago?

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:45.138
Go tell your superiors
that Hemant is above all.

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:48.424
Viren... think about your family.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.474
Your wife and kids...

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.962
He is speaking calculatively.

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.706
If you guys don't have decent offer

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:11.762
then at least give
a decent piece of advice.

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:24.985
'At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps'

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:28.233
'India will awake to light and freedom.'

00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:30.693
'India woke up to a mixed economy.'

00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:33.450
'The landlord system was abolished.'

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:39.564
'Then, to abolish poverty
private banks were nationalised.'

00:03:40.883 --> 00:03:42.627
In fact, even the newspapers were saying

00:03:42.707 --> 00:03:44.913
that India is on
the verge of bankruptcy.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.496
And foreign reserves are depleting.

00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:53.137
The government started
selling RBI's gold secretly.

00:03:53.217 --> 00:03:55.861
And India
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.940
The country was poor

00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:01.505
maybe it had poorer ideologies.

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:04.735
But as soon as the economy opened up

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:08.385
a small tip gave a man
some pretty big ideas.

00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:12.996
His ideas had flourished
even before him.

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:14.379
Greetings, Mr. Hemant.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.601
Hi, Mr. Baldev! How are you?

00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:18.997
Thank you very much.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.336
What for?

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.791
Taking such good care of my child.

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:26.479
But today is his last day here.

00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:29.543
I am moving him to Doon School.

00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:31.677
- Doon School?
- Yes.

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.152
- Straight to Doon School.
- Yes.

00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:37.933
That's quite a leap, Mr. Baldev.

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:41.132
Imagine, I won the jackpot.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:44.964
- What jackpot?
- Stock market.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.667
I've been investing
for the past 15-years now.

00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:52.164
But never made any good profit.

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:56.685
But last week a broker
gave me a very nice tip.

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:05.574
Bombay Textile is going to give
strong financial results in two weeks.

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:09.871
And the Singhanias want the broker
to buy one million shares.

00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:10.980
Starting now.

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:15.641
So that prices increase
when the results are declared.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.443
It's pretty simple, Mr. Hemant.

00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:23.883
I'll buy 20,000 shares
at the rate of 24 rupees.

00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:26.807
And the broker's told me

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:28.316
that once the results are declared

00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:30.982
the rate of my shares will
increase from 24 to 50 rupees.

00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:32.381
Imagine...

00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:37.430
520,000...

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.609
Yes. Profit!

00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:42.107
Sir, don't take
Mr. Baldev's tip so seriously.

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:49.034
Never interrupt a man
when he's aiming for the top.

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:54.581
Do one thing...

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.748
Find me
the Bombay Textile's Annual report.

00:05:59.934 --> 00:06:00.829
Yes, sir.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.468
Let's go.

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:16.916
Priya.

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:21.186
- Priya. Hurry up, Priya.
- Yes, dad. I am coming.

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:22.297
Which beer did you get this time?

00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:23.271
Thunderpunch.

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:24.570
Don't call it a beer.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.300
- Let's put a quarter of whiskey in it.
- Yeah! How are you?

00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:30.507
And next morning, full hangover.

00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:31.788
Just add water.

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:34.030
- Don't speak nonsense.
- You are speaking nonsense.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.467
In our budget,
whatever we buy will give us hangover.

00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:50.919
Listen, I'll arrange
a meeting with her today.

00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:53.527
You two have been watching each other
from a distance for a year now.

00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:55.153
- This meeting will happen today.
- Hey...

00:06:57.053 --> 00:06:58.535
I even said it's your birthday.

00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:01.897
Don't be upset and spoil our mood
if she refused to come over.

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:04.141
There you go, Viren. Let's start.
It's too late now.

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:06.178
He's going to sulk over Priya's denial.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.702
Pour some more.

00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:10.791
Hi...

00:07:11.903 --> 00:07:14.166
Beer? Goldspot.

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:16.173
Out here?

00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:17.317
Cheers.

00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:19.826
You're not drinking.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.345
You don't know about his tantrums.
He...

00:07:26.032 --> 00:07:29.652
I will drink.
Only when the best quality is available.

00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:34.773
"Happy birthday to you."

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:38.222
"Happy birthday to you."

00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:43.678
You have
the world's best brother and friend.

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.109
I know, but how do you know this?

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:53.732
Who else would arrange for a fake
birthday party in such a short time?

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:58.210
And you can't have
two birthdays in 7 months.

00:08:00.037 --> 00:08:01.697
Aunt had come over to give sweets.

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:11.062
Look Hemant, I don't want
to give you any wrong indication.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.706
I like you.

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:17.904
But...

00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:21.436
My mom and dad are looking
for a husband for me.

00:08:22.446 --> 00:08:24.469
And they even have a checklist.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.762
What?

00:08:28.253 --> 00:08:30.205
Meaning they have some conditions.

00:08:30.618 --> 00:08:36.460
Like the guy should own a car,
a proper job

00:08:37.074 --> 00:08:39.083
and most importantly

00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:42.903
he shouldn't be living in a rented home.

00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:45.819
He should have a home of his own.

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.579
And I've none.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:57.968
I don't believe in their conditions

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:02.710
but I can't go against them.

00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:09.015
What are you looking at?

00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:14.888
Hemant. Hemant.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.187
- Those guys are beating up Viren again.
- What?

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:22.822
- Move. Move back. Come on.
- Get aside.

00:09:22.902 --> 00:09:25.285
- Let me through. This is my home.
- Where are you going?

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.504
- What are you doing?
- One minute. One miinute.

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:30.432
- Let's just talk.
Why are you beating me? - Stop.

00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:32.667
- Leave me.
- What are you doing?

00:09:32.747 --> 00:09:34.010
- Let Viren go.
- Save me.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.191
Who are you?

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.771
I... I am his older brother.

00:09:38.092 --> 00:09:40.187
Better explain to your brother

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.758
when he borrows money from the market,
he should return it on time.

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:44.425
What did you think?

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:45.941
Hey...

00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:47.265
Talk to me. Don't hit me.

00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:48.285
I said talk to me.

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:50.194
He thinks if he doesn't answer my calls,
I'll lay off him.

00:09:51.345 --> 00:09:52.986
What is he talking about? What money?

00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:55.535
Brother, I got a tip...

00:09:55.615 --> 00:09:56.480
150,000 rupees.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.117
With interest, it amounts to 200,000!

00:09:58.553 --> 00:10:00.756
I invested the money
in the stock market and lost everything.

00:10:01.273 --> 00:10:02.709
- Hey...
- Let's talk.

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:05.086
Listen. Listen.

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:07.853
You'll get your money.

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:11.509
I assure you, just let him go.

00:10:12.348 --> 00:10:14.580
2 weeks... 200,000...

00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:16.314
Otherwise...

00:10:16.394 --> 00:10:17.502
Otherwise...

00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:20.631
You'll get it.

00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:21.735
- The entire amount?
- Please leave.

00:10:21.815 --> 00:10:23.109
- Let's go.
- Get lost.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.697
Which company did
you invest your money in?

00:10:28.964 --> 00:10:30.142
How do I say?

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:34.887
Two guys came to me with an
idea of setting up a beer factory.

00:10:36.414 --> 00:10:38.166
Basically,
it turned out to be a bogus company.

00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:41.980
Can I help?

00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:44.911
No.

00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:47.125
I'll handle it.

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:03.761
- It's not possible, Mr. Hemant.
- No, no Ashok, within a year.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.510
Come on Hemant,
if it was just 5000 or 10000...

00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:10.259
I can give you 60,000 for this.
And 6 months.

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:11.499
To get released.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.828
One lakh. Time 10 months.

00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:16.138
I can't win in negotiation.

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:18.138
80,000?

00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:20.895
- Viren!
- Yes, brother.

00:11:21.489 --> 00:11:22.989
Do one thing.

00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:27.056
Buy 5000 shares of Bombay Textiles.

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:29.139
Immediately.

00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:33.216
I visit Shirdi, stand in the queue
for 5-hours, pray for my children

00:11:33.296 --> 00:11:34.617
and what do my children do?

00:11:34.697 --> 00:11:36.128
Sell my jewellery.

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:38.186
No mom, we didn't sell.
It's an investment.

00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:40.319
Shut up! You've always been greedy.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.347
But you're the smarter one, Hemant.

00:11:44.367 --> 00:11:46.428
That's why I planned
this investment, mom.

00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:48.612
Nonsense...

00:11:48.692 --> 00:11:50.774
Brother what was your plan
behind this investment.

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:52.872
I got a tip,
I took a gamble and got screwed.

00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:54.741
You also did the same thing.

00:11:57.124 --> 00:11:59.722
There's a big difference
between a fluke and placing a bet.

00:12:00.427 --> 00:12:03.929
I planned this carefully, gathered
information, before making this bet.

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:06.449
What you did was a fluke.

00:12:07.567 --> 00:12:10.610
Bombay Textile is an enormous company.

00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:12.344
They are financially strong.

00:12:12.654 --> 00:12:13.925
They're planning for an expansion.

00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:16.037
Their share prices will rise for sure.
You just wait and watch.

00:12:16.483 --> 00:12:17.282
But when?

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:19.649
It's been five days,
and there is no hike at all.

00:12:20.002 --> 00:12:21.414
- It will.
- But when?

00:12:21.494 --> 00:12:22.752
I said it will.

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:25.191
It will just watch.

00:12:34.832 --> 00:12:37.757
- Did it rise?
- "This is a story I want everyone to see."

00:12:37.837 --> 00:12:40.219
"Watch as I crank up the jealousy."

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:43.093
"This is a story
I want everyone to see."

00:12:43.173 --> 00:12:45.400
"Because their mouths I've got to feed."

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.256
"They don't know how hard I strived."

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:50.843
"I was willing... to agree to it all."

00:12:50.923 --> 00:12:53.452
"All my life, they made me shed tears."

00:12:53.532 --> 00:12:55.873
"Everything I earned they took a share."

00:12:55.953 --> 00:12:58.606
"Even with teary eyes,
I kept their business going."

00:12:58.686 --> 00:13:00.972
"And yet they sidelined me."

00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:02.290
"It's all their treachery."

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.591
"Their trickery."

00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:06.351
"They hurt the entire country."

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.013
"They think I am a saint."

00:13:09.093 --> 00:13:10.722
You're not from the stock market

00:13:10.802 --> 00:13:12.627
and yet you took such a great leap.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.607
"Watch me closely,
I am the shackle holding you down."

00:13:16.687 --> 00:13:19.216
"Abusing in English sounds cool"

00:13:19.296 --> 00:13:22.133
"and my abusing makes
me sound like a fool."

00:13:22.213 --> 00:13:24.185
"These fools fill up the pool."

00:13:24.265 --> 00:13:27.447
"You may be the principal,
but I am the whole school."

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.238
'As expected the price of
Bombay Textile's shares hiked.'

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:33.868
'300,000 in two weeks.'

00:13:33.948 --> 00:13:36.902
'I hadn't made this huge amount
of money in three-years of my job.'

00:13:40.537 --> 00:13:45.093
[chanting prayers]

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:51.288
Viren, wake up. Come on, wake up.

00:13:51.368 --> 00:13:53.142
Viren. How does one
become a stockbroker?

00:13:53.222 --> 00:13:54.375
- I want to be one.
- What are you saying?

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:56.053
Stockbroker. Wake up.

00:13:57.881 --> 00:14:01.584
We made money from a tip that
comes once in a couple of years.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.799
We were lucky.

00:14:05.482 --> 00:14:08.521
It's a stressful job.
I am thinking of quitting.

00:14:09.409 --> 00:14:12.367
Only those with a habit of
winning become winners, understand.

00:14:12.447 --> 00:14:13.647
And you're talking about quitting.

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.585
Whose quitting what?

00:14:15.665 --> 00:14:16.911
Shoes...

00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:19.978
Nothing. Leave it.

00:14:21.103 --> 00:14:21.915
Give it.

00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:26.122
I want to be a stockbroker, and
he's talking about quitting the market.

00:14:26.487 --> 00:14:28.011
This is our opportunity
to make a fortune

00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:29.281
but he's being a wimp.

00:14:29.754 --> 00:14:30.831
Wait a second.

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.555
You can't become a stockbroker easily.

00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:34.179
You'll need a lot of money for that.

00:14:34.663 --> 00:14:37.214
You'll need connections
with renowned businessmen.

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:40.185
And no one will let you
inside the ring like this.

00:14:42.225 --> 00:14:44.000
I am done doing simple jobs.

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:48.711
Mom, please make him understand.
He's lost his mind.

00:14:49.024 --> 00:14:51.463
Hemant. Hemant.

00:14:51.782 --> 00:14:52.866
Hemant.

00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:55.911
Move. Move. Let me do it.

00:14:58.372 --> 00:15:02.543
Listen, son,
such miracles won't happen every day.

00:15:03.197 --> 00:15:05.312
People call the stock market
a gamble ground.

00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:07.557
Try to understand.

00:15:07.914 --> 00:15:10.685
This family runs on your earnings.

00:15:11.147 --> 00:15:13.946
Without that...

00:15:14.292 --> 00:15:18.133
Mom, it wasn't a fluke, please.

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.770
I took advantage of the information.

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.343
Advantage...

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.074
And information can be obtained...

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.082
Last time I did it
because I was helpless.

00:15:27.162 --> 00:15:29.180
This time I'll do it,
so we're never helpless again.

00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:31.059
Try to understand.

00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:33.642
But, listen...

00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:37.265
I've done 6 jobs in 14-years.

00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:38.679
And what do we have?

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:40.375
Priya is on the verge of getting married

00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:42.492
and this is my opportunity
to make a fortune.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.367
Don't worry. You won't regret it.

00:15:44.447 --> 00:15:45.790
- Hemant.
- Yeah...

00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:49.166
Let's go, we're getting late for office.

00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:52.046
Mom, did you make him understand?

00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:54.655
You won't quit the share market.

00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:57.694
You will support Hemant. He needs you.

00:15:59.382 --> 00:16:00.649
So, he made you understand.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.397
If brother can perform
such a miracle again

00:16:05.477 --> 00:16:08.081
then we will be sorted for life.

00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:12.591
You think, he can't do it.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.650
No.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.812
I am scared that he'll do it again.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.377
- Where to?
- Inside.

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:21.097
You can't go in. Come on.

00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:23.855
And then he won't stop.

00:16:25.657 --> 00:16:27.094
- Brother.
- "Rich are happy"

00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:28.783
- "because poor are on sale."
- Get aside. Come on.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.354
"Whose fault is it?
And who goes to jail."

00:16:31.434 --> 00:16:34.156
"Do you wanna be a Cheetah?
Or just a Snail."

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:36.635
"I'm helpless
because my plates never full."

00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:38.019
- "The society will think"
- 300 rupees...

00:16:38.099 --> 00:16:39.263
"my deeds are shameful."

00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:41.603
- "I'll alone pull the weights."
- I'll order the tea and come.

00:16:42.128 --> 00:16:44.421
"Remember,
I am the one and only Big Bull."

00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:47.112
"Let's go."

00:16:47.192 --> 00:16:49.590
"This is a story
I want everyone to see."

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.192
"Watch as I crank up the jealousy."

00:16:52.272 --> 00:16:54.674
Which treasure is he searching for,
in this scrap shop?

00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:57.563
"I've to satiate their hunger too..."

00:16:57.643 --> 00:17:00.126
"This is a story
I want everyone to see."

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:02.855
"Watch as I crank up the jealousy."

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:08.466
If fate had favoured me,
and I had more contacts

00:17:09.873 --> 00:17:12.619
I could've taken this city to the sky.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:18.344
A real man makes his own destiny.

00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:23.859
I will.

00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:26.811
And soon.

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:31.223
We'll have a grand wedding.

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:34.302
You've big dreams, Hemant.

00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:36.940
I like it.

00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:40.843
But I can't wait
for you to fulfill them.

00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:44.770
Before taking this city to the sky

00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:47.977
I want you to be
worthy enough to ask for me.

00:17:52.018 --> 00:17:55.847
We do all the work,
and Kantilal takes half the share.

00:17:56.955 --> 00:18:01.104
We'll have to get out of this small
world of sub-broking and be bigger.

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.508
We'll have to take
the membership of BSE.

00:18:07.317 --> 00:18:08.669
Are you joking?

00:18:09.853 --> 00:18:11.270
Your idea is great.

00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:14.264
But the fee for BSE's membership
is one million rupees.

00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.690
We get only 500-1000 rupees.

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:19.003
We make 12,000 in a month.

00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:20.610
Let's go.

00:18:21.054 --> 00:18:23.059
The market is unpredictable. Got it?

00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:25.476
Kanti bhai, here's your cheque for 50%

00:18:27.793 --> 00:18:28.783
Okay.

00:18:29.414 --> 00:18:32.851
Hemant, bring me a big tip.

00:18:33.515 --> 00:18:39.553
Giving me 50% out of every deal
will get you nowhere.

00:18:39.813 --> 00:18:40.613
Understood.

00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:43.217
What to do?

00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:46.625
My father didn't leave
behind a broker's card for me.

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:51.625
We've to settle the accounts
with Rajesh as well.

00:18:51.705 --> 00:18:52.667
Kanti bhai...

00:18:54.518 --> 00:18:56.650
Be careful.
You don't know what to say...

00:18:58.963 --> 00:19:01.939
Rajesh, please settle our accounts.

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:08.058
Hey, what are you doing, sir?

00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:10.735
- Viren. Let's go.
- Yes.

00:19:11.812 --> 00:19:13.090
- Where?
- I said, let's go.

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:15.642
At least tell me

00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:19.050
what you read in the newspaper

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.136
that we're going to visit
this big Union Leader.

00:19:22.969 --> 00:19:24.879
Premier auto vehicles are in demand

00:19:25.246 --> 00:19:26.851
there is 6 months
of waiting for a vehicle.

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.687
Will he get us
a dealership of the vehicles?

00:19:33.251 --> 00:19:36.769
The company is increasing
production to meet the demand.

00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:38.510
This means the share price
is going to rise.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.195
But why are we in such a hurry?

00:19:41.073 --> 00:19:45.345
Rana Sawant has instructed the company
to fulfill the demands of the workers

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:46.662
or else he will get down to strike.

00:19:47.308 --> 00:19:48.709
What is it to us?

00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:51.721
I want to know whether

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.441
he's actually going on a strike
or just a baseless threat?

00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:59.557
We're average people.
How can we question him?

00:20:07.108 --> 00:20:10.571
Raju, does Sawant carry a gun?

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.584
Not just him,
even his dozen bodyguards carry guns.

00:20:13.664 --> 00:20:14.909
And that too imported ones.

00:20:18.422 --> 00:20:20.214
Brother, I am not going. You go.

00:20:21.714 --> 00:20:25.440
You want the nectar
but not willing to churn the ocean.

00:20:26.416 --> 00:20:27.691
I don't want to die.

00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:29.591
I am scared. You go alone.

00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:32.138
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

00:20:32.218 --> 00:20:34.135
Let's go. Let's go.

00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:38.988
Hello, boss.

00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:40.709
Wait.

00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:43.520
Does this look like a carnival to you?

00:20:44.373 --> 00:20:45.216
Who is the boss?

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:47.117
He's the boss.

00:20:47.933 --> 00:20:51.850
Only the boss can meet the boss, okay.

00:20:53.091 --> 00:20:54.768
You sit here. Come on. Sit.

00:20:55.094 --> 00:20:55.934
Let's go.

00:20:58.403 --> 00:21:00.144
- Is everything safe inside?
- Yes.

00:21:08.488 --> 00:21:09.906
You have five minutes.

00:21:11.216 --> 00:21:14.640
I am a broker,
here to talk about your profit.

00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:19.068
I don't treat people
who lie to us about our benefits.

00:21:22.498 --> 00:21:25.344
I am not big enough yet to risk my life.

00:21:35.353 --> 00:21:36.213
Look.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.997
You fulfill the needs of workers

00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:44.598
so is me for the middle class people.

00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:46.385
What help do you want from us?

00:21:47.742 --> 00:21:49.081
I am here to help you.

00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:58.181
You have 2300 workers
at the Premier Auto Plant.

00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:04.311
A week's strike means
350,000 in expense...

00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:06.177
which I can give you.

00:22:09.798 --> 00:22:11.337
You'll give me 350,000 rupees.

00:22:15.478 --> 00:22:16.608
Have you seen your condition?

00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:25.701
Two things are considered
important in life.

00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:29.722
Water and Gold.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.976
A person cannot survive without water.

00:22:35.583 --> 00:22:36.464
And Gold...

00:22:37.382 --> 00:22:42.226
Gold can't be used
for man's daily needs.

00:22:43.657 --> 00:22:48.923
Yet the rate of gold
is higher than water.

00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:54.026
Come to the point.

00:22:57.157 --> 00:23:00.097
I'll build my value like gold.

00:23:16.192 --> 00:23:17.082
10,000...

00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:21.821
I can turn it into Ten lakh rupees
if you help me.

00:23:25.254 --> 00:23:30.292
Why would I have any connection
with a man who talks about turning

00:23:33.235 --> 00:23:34.483
10,000 rupees to Ten lakh rupees?

00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:36.077
Why should I trust you?

00:23:36.363 --> 00:23:39.276
Because the risk is on me. Not you.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.802
This 10,000 is my life's earnings.

00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:53.214
You just have to give me one
information, and you'll lose nothing.

00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:57.346
But if I can't take
advantage of that information

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.522
then I am finished.

00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:03.518
What information do you want?

00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:11.699
When and which plant will you call
for a strike and when will you end it?

00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:23.493
"Do you know where money belongs?"

00:24:23.573 --> 00:24:26.080
"Consider it a sin
or consider it a blessing."

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.710
"Makes and breaks lives overnight."

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.256
"Fill your pockets or make wealth."

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:33.785
"Do you want to change
to system or blame it?"

00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:36.445
"Do you want to catch me or my game?"

00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:39.056
"I am the bull you can never tame."

00:24:39.136 --> 00:24:41.657
"Their hands move
when at me they take aim."

00:24:41.737 --> 00:24:44.204
"The poor are silent
because the rich get's easy bail."

00:24:44.284 --> 00:24:46.855
"Rich are happy
because poor are on sale."

00:24:46.935 --> 00:24:49.422
"Whose fault is it?
And who goes to jail."

00:24:49.502 --> 00:24:52.200
"Do you wanna be a Cheetah?
Or just a Snail."

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.698
"I'm helpless
because my plates never full."

00:24:54.778 --> 00:24:57.327
"The society will think
my deeds are shameful."

00:24:57.407 --> 00:25:00.106
"I'll alone pull the weights."

00:25:00.186 --> 00:25:02.631
"Remember,
I am the one and only Big Bull."

00:25:06.242 --> 00:25:07.508
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

00:25:18.493 --> 00:25:19.981
So you want to be a broker.

00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:26.088
You do know
what it takes to get this card.

00:25:26.573 --> 00:25:27.534
Yes.

00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:30.632
It comes with great responsibility.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.922
Yes, I know.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.732
We know too.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.521
I know what you're doing
with Premier Auto.

00:25:51.575 --> 00:25:56.309
What are we doing, sir?
Just making some money, that's it.

00:25:56.645 --> 00:26:00.596
Making money, huh.

00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:04.816
Shall I let you in on a secret?

00:26:05.754 --> 00:26:11.449
You're investing in the market
by gathering secret information

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.115
it's called Insider Trading.

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:18.728
You're lucky this law
doesn't exist in India yet.

00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:24.079
If this was America,
you would be behind bars.

00:26:26.642 --> 00:26:30.522
There's still time.
Mend your ways. Got it?

00:26:38.053 --> 00:26:39.359
You bring the law

00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:43.148
we'll stop doing it.

00:26:48.972 --> 00:26:50.471
What a stare you gave that Mannu.

00:26:50.784 --> 00:26:51.767
He was scared.

00:26:52.209 --> 00:26:53.685
Give him the stare is not my motive.

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:55.214
Watch what I do next.

00:26:55.294 --> 00:26:57.377
Listen, our new office...

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.156
- What happened, man?
- Rana Sawant got murdered.

00:27:06.236 --> 00:27:08.280
Run for your lives.
The riot is going on.

00:27:28.782 --> 00:27:31.917
'Rana Sawant's murder wasn't
the first shock for Hemant.'

00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:41.005
'But it prepared Hemant for the ups and
downs of the market, as well as life.'

00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.333
'Today, in Hemant Shah's
case a big news will be disclosed.'

00:27:48.413 --> 00:27:50.163
Sir...

00:27:50.243 --> 00:27:51.690
- Sir...
- One question, sir. Please.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.388
One at a time.
Ask your questions one by one, please.

00:27:54.468 --> 00:27:55.518
One at a time.

00:27:55.598 --> 00:27:58.493
Mr. Ashok,
why do you think you're here?

00:27:59.488 --> 00:28:01.656
I came to have a drink at the bar.
Will you join me?

00:28:01.736 --> 00:28:04.340
Such stupid questions
deserve stupid answers. Next.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.247
- Sir!
- Yes.

00:28:05.327 --> 00:28:08.177
As Hemant's lawyer,
what is your opinion on everything

00:28:08.257 --> 00:28:09.387
that transpired in the last six months?

00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:11.986
It's very unfair to him. That's it.

00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:12.937
- Sir.
- Yes.

00:28:13.017 --> 00:28:14.986
What big expose will happen
at the press conference today?

00:28:15.066 --> 00:28:16.566
Please give us a hint.

00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:20.502
Look, when Hemant is
involved expect something big.

00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:23.414
But let me tell you, this time
there's going to be an explosion.

00:28:23.494 --> 00:28:24.652
- Explosion?
- Yes.

00:28:24.732 --> 00:28:25.507
Be prepared for it.

00:28:25.587 --> 00:28:26.837
- That's all for now. Thank you.
- Sir...

00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:35.927
Have you thought this through?

00:28:45.237 --> 00:28:47.579
We should've got married
instead of getting the membership.

00:28:49.707 --> 00:28:51.033
We've only 17,000 rupees in the bank.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.367
Do I pay the office rent or salaries?

00:28:53.447 --> 00:28:55.932
Will you ever say anything positive?

00:28:56.012 --> 00:28:57.615
We've a BR worth 40 lakh Rupees.

00:28:57.695 --> 00:29:00.769
Venkateshwar is the head
of securities and trading.

00:29:01.143 --> 00:29:02.316
I am sure it's going
to be something big.

00:29:02.396 --> 00:29:04.621
I was supposed to go
watch a film with Tara.

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:06.333
Come with me quietly.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.312
And you can watch movies on the
VCR with Tara for the rest of your life.

00:29:10.581 --> 00:29:12.543
- Does Venkateshwar sell VCRs too?
- Keep quiet.

00:29:14.592 --> 00:29:16.922
Why did you stop here?
The bank is much further ahead.

00:29:18.163 --> 00:29:21.205
We'll take a cab from here.

00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:22.745
What for?

00:29:23.609 --> 00:29:25.211
We're brokers.

00:29:25.503 --> 00:29:26.689
We've a membership worth Ten lakh rupees

00:29:26.769 --> 00:29:29.016
but they don't know that we're broke.

00:29:30.017 --> 00:29:30.871
Fix your shirt.

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:33.542
Taxi!

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.475
Hari... sent this.

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:52.223
Look Hemant and Viren.

00:29:52.303 --> 00:29:54.713
The banking system has formed a new law.

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:59.806
We're investing
our surplus funds with other banks

00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:05.304
but now those transactions
can only be done through a broker.

00:30:08.563 --> 00:30:11.568
So every bank
has to invest its surplus fund

00:30:11.648 --> 00:30:13.256
and through a broker.

00:30:13.336 --> 00:30:17.738
Yes. It's an investment between banks.

00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:22.695
So the government wants brokers
to make a small fortune too.

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:26.340
Why not?

00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:30.097
Look... if a bank needs money

00:30:30.177 --> 00:30:33.179
those banks with surplus funds
will lend it to them.

00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:36.393
For a short term,
and charge interest of course.

00:30:36.893 --> 00:30:40.654
Now they can't give security every day.

00:30:40.941 --> 00:30:41.823
Right.

00:30:42.249 --> 00:30:43.874
That's why the borrower bank...

00:30:43.954 --> 00:30:45.787
The bank that's borrowing the money

00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:48.805
will issue a BR like this.

00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:51.210
We call it a Bank Receipt.

00:30:51.988 --> 00:30:57.764
I am issuing you
a pay order today of four million.

00:31:08.928 --> 00:31:12.159
In your name, against this BR.

00:31:13.842 --> 00:31:19.093
Two weeks later Bank of Satara will
return this four million with interest

00:31:19.173 --> 00:31:22.965
and you'll transfer that money
to our bank from your account.

00:31:24.729 --> 00:31:27.428
Then we'll return
this Bank Receipt to you.

00:31:28.495 --> 00:31:35.082
For the settlement
and reconciliation of the Bank of Satara.

00:31:36.518 --> 00:31:37.659
Understood.

00:31:38.091 --> 00:31:43.960
For this,
we'll pay you a commission of 0.01%

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.974
- 0.01%
- Yes.

00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:49.444
Something big, as you said.

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:52.394
We'll get 400 rupees as commission.

00:31:54.713 --> 00:31:55.916
Our lives are changed.

00:31:59.265 --> 00:32:02.687
Look, we're giving you
a cheque of 40 lakh rupees today.

00:32:02.767 --> 00:32:05.211
Tomorrow it could be 40 crores also.

00:32:05.963 --> 00:32:09.723
The transaction between
the banks will increase every day.

00:32:10.104 --> 00:32:13.917
And our banks always have surplus funds.

00:32:14.347 --> 00:32:17.207
You can get a cheque daily

00:32:18.155 --> 00:32:20.930
from our bank or maybe another.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.736
Good luck.

00:32:29.652 --> 00:32:31.182
0.01%

00:32:31.645 --> 00:32:32.809
Something big, you said.

00:32:33.424 --> 00:32:35.645
I've a cheque for forty lakh rupees.

00:32:36.267 --> 00:32:37.526
It's any day more than one million.

00:32:37.606 --> 00:32:41.820
Look, one needs money
to start any business.

00:32:42.575 --> 00:32:43.901
This is that money.

00:32:45.124 --> 00:32:47.516
I don't have time to
arrange for working capital.

00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:50.155
You know,
I don't know how to tread slow.

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:53.311
Stop trying to be funny.
This money belongs to the bank, not you.

00:32:54.663 --> 00:32:56.189
It's mine for two weeks.

00:32:56.863 --> 00:32:59.117
Using someone else's
money as our working capital.

00:32:59.704 --> 00:33:00.936
It's risky.

00:33:02.071 --> 00:33:04.768
Show me any business
that doesn't involve risk.

00:33:04.848 --> 00:33:06.881
If there is one,
let's quit all this and take that up.

00:33:07.204 --> 00:33:08.122
Okay?

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.624
- Look, the bank's not going
to give us a loan. - Yes.

00:33:13.704 --> 00:33:16.630
But we can keep this money as a loan.

00:33:26.034 --> 00:33:29.158
Wow... it's awesome.

00:33:30.461 --> 00:33:31.537
It's my first gift to you.

00:33:32.752 --> 00:33:35.518
Don't make it the last
by saying it as the best.

00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:42.232
Hemant, I cannot accept this.

00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:44.341
Priya.

00:33:45.249 --> 00:33:46.461
Go downstairs.

00:33:52.216 --> 00:33:53.380
What's in it? Open it?

00:33:59.409 --> 00:34:00.481
How much is it worth?

00:34:02.517 --> 00:34:03.644
10,000.

00:34:04.154 --> 00:34:05.701
Why are you wasting money?

00:34:07.643 --> 00:34:10.951
Look Hemant,
I don't want to see my daughter

00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:13.877
living in these quarters
for the rest of her life.

00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:18.868
Priya knows only one Hemant,
I've seen a dozen.

00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:22.608
If you were in any other business,
then maybe I would've thought about

00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:24.586
when you'll buy home and a car.

00:34:25.993 --> 00:34:27.106
But a broker...

00:34:29.594 --> 00:34:30.753
Is a broker only, right?

00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:43.591
And don't make a scene
at Priya's wedding.

00:34:47.164 --> 00:34:48.338
Take it back.

00:34:55.608 --> 00:34:57.690
That forty lakhs belong to the bank.

00:34:58.328 --> 00:35:00.262
We can't do what you're thinking.

00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:02.523
Listen!

00:35:06.643 --> 00:35:07.982
Even that amount is too less now.

00:35:08.943 --> 00:35:10.392
I want 2 crore rupees.

00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:11.948
2 crores?

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.656
Priya only got engaged.
The wedding is six months away.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.994
[indistinct chatter]

00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:35.884
What happened?

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.038
Speak up. Stop seeking attention.

00:35:45.398 --> 00:35:47.056
I am going to lose my job.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.188
And might even go to jail.

00:35:51.488 --> 00:35:52.389
Why?

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:58.354
I sanctioned a loan for 30 lakh rupees
to a guy against a property.

00:35:59.729 --> 00:36:00.932
Now he's disappeared.

00:36:01.198 --> 00:36:02.662
I don't know what to do.

00:36:04.481 --> 00:36:06.499
Do something, Hemant.
I can't think of anything.

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:10.095
I want 30 lakhs at any cost.

00:36:11.698 --> 00:36:13.162
What's going on here?

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.666
He wants 2 crores, you want 30 lakhs.

00:36:17.144 --> 00:36:18.879
We don't have enough money
to pay the staff's salary.

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:21.490
We've turned off the AC
to save on electricity bill.

00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:23.867
What do I do?

00:36:24.647 --> 00:36:25.892
You tell me what to do? Go to jail?

00:36:26.983 --> 00:36:28.487
Talk to your seniors.

00:36:30.316 --> 00:36:32.793
No one's going to understand,
Viren, just like you.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.188
Listen... Hey!

00:36:36.385 --> 00:36:37.415
I said listen...

00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:41.879
You know about our condition as well.

00:36:43.247 --> 00:36:44.590
Have faith.

00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:47.597
We'll think of something.
We'll come up with something.

00:36:47.677 --> 00:36:48.635
Forget it, Viren.

00:36:49.327 --> 00:36:52.358
Viren sir.
Hemant sir's calling him back.

00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:59.704
Hari, issue me a BR tomorrow
for 2 crore rupees in the name of NBI.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.679
Leave it me to me on how
to get it approved by Venkateshwar.

00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:07.524
When I turn that 2 crores into 3 crores
you will get 30 lakh rupees.

00:37:08.332 --> 00:37:09.224
What?

00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:12.753
Wait a second. Wait a second.

00:37:13.787 --> 00:37:15.490
Fake BR worth 2 crores?

00:37:24.654 --> 00:37:28.248
Look... remember Premier Auto.

00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:29.533
Yes.

00:37:30.046 --> 00:37:33.788
Imagine if we had
2 crore rupees back then

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.678
where could that have taken us?

00:37:39.623 --> 00:37:42.829
Hemant,
what you're asking for is too big.

00:37:43.152 --> 00:37:44.454
Bigger than going to jail?

00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:53.141
Listen, you'll be going to jail
for two-years for this loan case.

00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:56.749
If you get caught for issuing fake BR,
you'll be jailed for 5-years.

00:37:57.153 --> 00:37:59.536
In any case, you're going to jail.

00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:01.462
I am taking all the risk.

00:38:03.286 --> 00:38:07.113
Imagine what if you don't get caught?

00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:10.725
Then you're free.

00:38:12.347 --> 00:38:13.701
And I'll be a millionaire.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.304
Think about it.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.326
I'll give you until tomorrow morning.

00:38:26.274 --> 00:38:28.050
- Sir, Mr. Jayesh...
- Call him.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.056
Okay.

00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:31.798
- Give the keys.
- Jayesh bhai, we have to buy 5000.

00:38:32.318 --> 00:38:33.581
Go to your cabin. I am coming.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.094
- Tell me, everthing after coming.
- Okay.

00:38:38.628 --> 00:38:41.311
You were supposed to go to Rawat
Consultant's office. What happened?

00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:44.943
Will 2 crores turn into 3 crore rupees?

00:38:48.257 --> 00:38:49.825
We don't even have 2 crore yet.

00:38:50.576 --> 00:38:51.769
I'll make it 3 crore...

00:38:55.044 --> 00:38:56.604
- Yes?
- Sir, can't get through.

00:38:57.179 --> 00:39:00.598
I called at their office, but the
NCC guy says we can't talk to the MD.

00:39:00.678 --> 00:39:03.272
He's very busy.
You can meet him only next month.

00:39:06.252 --> 00:39:08.037
- Can I go, sir?
- Okay.

00:39:09.301 --> 00:39:11.286
Why do you want to meet NCC's MD?

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.077
Look, our country is going
through a sensitive phase.

00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:23.596
The new government is opening up
its market for new business.

00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:26.674
Now foreign countries will invest here.

00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:30.308
The law of business is
the same as that of the sea.

00:39:31.373 --> 00:39:34.865
The big fish will swallow
small fishes like NCC.

00:39:35.858 --> 00:39:39.094
If I can explain this to the NCC's MD

00:39:39.174 --> 00:39:43.887
then I will turn this
2 crores into 5 crores.

00:39:50.128 --> 00:39:50.979
Hello.

00:39:52.175 --> 00:39:54.441
Yeah, just a minute. Hari.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.951
Yeah, Hari.

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:05.707
Okay.

00:40:26.027 --> 00:40:29.789
- Venkateshwar sir, greetings.
- Hemant, how are you?

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:30.944
Please, take a seat.

00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:34.729
- So, you'll have tea?
- Yeah.

00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:39.206
So how does the market...

00:40:42.224 --> 00:40:43.266
Please.

00:40:47.169 --> 00:40:48.486
Please... tell me.

00:40:53.352 --> 00:40:54.330
Yeah.

00:40:56.782 --> 00:41:00.154
20 lakhs, 30 lakhs...

00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:04.135
35 lakhs!

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.482
2 crores.

00:41:14.113 --> 00:41:16.478
2 crores...

00:41:30.844 --> 00:41:32.116
What is this?

00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:34.624
I don't think you remember.

00:41:36.187 --> 00:41:39.247
To save you from your wife's temper.

00:41:40.072 --> 00:41:41.847
Happy Wedding Anniversary.

00:41:46.147 --> 00:41:47.273
Oh my...

00:41:48.251 --> 00:41:50.780
All this. Please...

00:41:52.768 --> 00:41:55.513
Well, thank you so much.

00:41:56.218 --> 00:41:58.616
You remembered my anniversary.

00:41:59.144 --> 00:42:03.626
Well, I'll make pay orders
against all these BRs.

00:42:04.331 --> 00:42:05.995
Please. Have tea. Okay?

00:42:16.412 --> 00:42:18.563
Hello. The job's done.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.268
Half!

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.957
The rest lies in your hands, Hemant.

00:42:23.909 --> 00:42:25.425
Your job isn't done yet.

00:42:26.174 --> 00:42:29.721
You'll have to give me
BR's worth 20 and 50 million now.

00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:31.625
There's no stopping now, Hari.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.988
Hello. You asked me to call back at 3.

00:42:44.068 --> 00:42:49.365
Sir, I told you to call back
on the 3rd... of next month.

00:42:49.445 --> 00:42:52.770
Is he so busy that he can't spare
five minutes to make 5 crore rupees?

00:43:00.627 --> 00:43:03.677
- Hello!
- Buy 5000 shares of NCC.

00:43:03.757 --> 00:43:05.369
The rate's 300, buy it at 320.

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:07.862
Yes, Viren. Okay.

00:43:07.942 --> 00:43:09.573
NCC. NCC... buy 20.

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:10.972
74...

00:43:11.052 --> 00:43:11.918
Buy 40.

00:43:11.998 --> 00:43:13.672
NCC. NCC... buy 30.

00:43:13.752 --> 00:43:16.852
- Buy 50...
- Buy 60.

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:19.352
Buy NCC shares at a rate of 340.

00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:22.615
500...

00:43:23.765 --> 00:43:26.302
Did see the rate of NCC's
shares is at an all-time high.

00:43:26.382 --> 00:43:28.211
'Huge spike in the stock market.'

00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:31.715
'Price of NCC's shares
jumped from 300 to 500.'

00:43:34.948 --> 00:43:37.676
Sir. We just a call from NCC.

00:43:37.756 --> 00:43:39.818
Their MD wants to meet you immediately.

00:43:48.267 --> 00:43:50.316
- I'm here to meet, Mr. Singh.
- Yes.

00:43:52.513 --> 00:43:53.562
This way, please.

00:43:57.227 --> 00:43:59.030
What do you see in this painting?

00:44:00.191 --> 00:44:02.593
They look expensive to me. All of them.

00:44:03.014 --> 00:44:04.279
They look expensive to me.

00:44:06.903 --> 00:44:08.196
You didn't see the texture

00:44:09.103 --> 00:44:13.028
or the light-shadow play,
or the colour choice.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:15.749
Just the price tag.

00:44:18.879 --> 00:44:21.086
My guess about you was right.

00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:25.291
You're just a broker
who wants to meet me.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.131
We can never be equal

00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.883
then why are you trying to equal me?

00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:34.855
Why are you after my shares?

00:44:36.951 --> 00:44:38.127
Because...

00:44:40.157 --> 00:44:41.641
Even though your company

00:44:41.952 --> 00:44:45.366
is the market leader in cement
it's far too undervalued.

00:44:45.837 --> 00:44:46.875
Meaning?

00:44:47.755 --> 00:44:51.163
Something wrong with my
financials or something else...

00:44:52.024 --> 00:44:53.093
None of that.

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.045
Your company's value is 100 crores.

00:44:57.409 --> 00:45:00.254
But according to me,
it's worth 900 crores.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:06.393
Because if someone wants
to set up a company like NCC today

00:45:06.473 --> 00:45:09.614
then he'll need an
investment of 300 crores.

00:45:10.415 --> 00:45:11.624
Three times more.

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:15.008
That's my replacement cost theory.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.766
Right now you're holding
90% of your company's shares.

00:45:21.233 --> 00:45:22.264
90...

00:45:22.816 --> 00:45:26.706
If you put only 10% in the market

00:45:27.272 --> 00:45:29.894
then I can take this
100 crores to 900 crores.

00:45:30.514 --> 00:45:32.514
You'll lose some of your shares.

00:45:32.594 --> 00:45:34.120
From 90 to only 80%

00:45:34.676 --> 00:45:37.882
But their value will be 10 times more.

00:45:41.712 --> 00:45:43.807
- Sir...
- We'll talk later, Behrouz.

00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:49.600
900 crores?

00:45:51.369 --> 00:45:52.934
Have you seen 9 crores?

00:45:54.904 --> 00:45:57.637
Do you have any idea how
much money you're talking about?

00:45:59.995 --> 00:46:01.251
You've seen it, haven't you?

00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:03.449
You've an idea about it.

00:46:04.507 --> 00:46:07.162
So, am I saying anything wrong?

00:46:09.039 --> 00:46:12.315
How high can you take
the value of my shares?

00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:20.053
Your shares will make history.

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.511
I can guarantee you that.

00:46:23.152 --> 00:46:24.377
Just say yes.

00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:27.764
Such confidence.

00:46:29.759 --> 00:46:31.629
If the value goes up to 1000...

00:46:33.093 --> 00:46:34.280
I'll believe you.

00:46:35.284 --> 00:46:36.812
Can you do it in 6-months?

00:46:39.582 --> 00:46:40.953
I don't have that much time.

00:46:49.493 --> 00:46:50.383
And yes...

00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:53.867
I can see another thing.

00:46:54.958 --> 00:46:56.063
The painter's name.

00:46:58.001 --> 00:46:59.340
Khalid Dorabji.

00:47:00.179 --> 00:47:03.946
He's ill. Lying in a hospital in Paris.

00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:05.789
Less chances of his survival.

00:47:06.164 --> 00:47:10.093
So you buy the painting before I do.

00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:13.177
Because soon they
will become invaluable.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.536
'NCC's shares which were seeing
a daily jump in price of 50-80 rupees.'

00:47:22.616 --> 00:47:25.277
'It been said that NCC's shares...'

00:47:25.357 --> 00:47:28.740
'In few months,
Hemant Shah with his new and...'

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:33.757
Hemant took the price
of NCC's shares to 5000 rupees.

00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:36.860
Many industrialist and businessmen

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.469
started seeing Hemant
expecting the same miracle.

00:47:39.794 --> 00:47:41.386
What is the stock market?

00:47:41.797 --> 00:47:44.564
You've to go see an agent for that.
You know, brokers.

00:47:44.644 --> 00:47:46.032
Should I invest some money too?

00:47:46.372 --> 00:47:49.383
You should.
Investing in little money is good.

00:47:49.463 --> 00:47:51.149
You'll get results in six-months.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.644
Unbelievable Sudeep,
at least check the spellings.

00:47:54.927 --> 00:47:57.755
Some retired uncle will write a letter
to the editor and bother him again.

00:47:57.835 --> 00:47:58.955
Do you want that?

00:47:59.372 --> 00:48:00.341
Meera.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.299
Think of the devil... Sir.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:06.026
Why are we ignoring the Hemant Shah
and Stock Exchange story?

00:48:06.448 --> 00:48:07.477
- Really?
- Really!

00:48:07.557 --> 00:48:09.315
I need an answer.
Will you please answer me?

00:48:09.712 --> 00:48:11.515
I am the chief editor,
I hope you know that.

00:48:12.592 --> 00:48:13.760
- I know that.
- Yeah!

00:48:14.128 --> 00:48:17.317
We're not ignoring it. We're infact
celebrating the stock market rally.

00:48:17.707 --> 00:48:20.891
Come on, Meera,
I am sure something is happening there.

00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:22.868
Wake up and smell the coffee.

00:48:23.495 --> 00:48:26.977
Being a communist if you edit a financial
paper, you're bound to draw attention.

00:48:27.643 --> 00:48:30.133
Something's cooking there, Meera.
Come on.

00:48:30.594 --> 00:48:32.887
The middle-class is pocketing
some of the rich's money.

00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:35.248
That's all that's happening.
You should be happy.

00:48:35.756 --> 00:48:37.930
Oh! Really?

00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:42.590
'History was created
at the Stock market today.'

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.159
'The ever increasing price of
NCC's share has reached 5000 rupees.'

00:48:46.477 --> 00:48:49.150
'It's being said that every share
that Hemant Shah's bought'

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.048
'is seeing a steep incline.'

00:48:53.272 --> 00:48:57.026
MD sir, your shares
have reached record price.

00:48:57.876 --> 00:49:01.415
Now do as I say, dilute your stake.

00:49:01.699 --> 00:49:03.390
From 55% to 30%

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:06.198
and earn the biggest
profit of your life.

00:49:06.992 --> 00:49:09.710
But Hemant, the share price is going up.

00:49:10.153 --> 00:49:11.503
Shouldn't we wait?

00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:16.800
MD sir, I alone am
controlling this price.

00:49:17.653 --> 00:49:19.162
Sell them now.

00:49:22.024 --> 00:49:23.055
Yes, Hemant sir.

00:49:31.183 --> 00:49:35.450
Shekhar,
buy all the NCC shares you can get.

00:49:36.185 --> 00:49:37.584
Called me a broker.

00:49:38.545 --> 00:49:40.476
How far are you planning
to take the share's price?

00:49:41.206 --> 00:49:42.039
9000.

00:49:42.353 --> 00:49:43.363
9000?

00:49:47.155 --> 00:49:48.228
What happened?

00:49:49.203 --> 00:49:51.854
The '0's don't fit
on the calculator anymore.

00:50:23.313 --> 00:50:24.868
What the...

00:50:25.837 --> 00:50:29.048
Do you want to marry a girl
who doesn't love you?

00:50:29.463 --> 00:50:30.570
You don't.

00:50:30.919 --> 00:50:34.628
Priya and I love each other.
We want to get married.

00:50:35.486 --> 00:50:39.300
I know I took too long to tell you,
but... as the saying goes...

00:50:39.765 --> 00:50:41.127
Better late than never.

00:50:44.978 --> 00:50:46.485
You'll get to keep only one car key.

00:50:46.931 --> 00:50:49.259
The other one is for
my greedy father-in-law.

00:50:50.259 --> 00:50:53.803
'With the price of NCC
shares touching 11,000 rupees'

00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:58.584
'Hemant Shah has started
share market's biggest... Bull run!'

00:51:11.203 --> 00:51:13.664
Finally, after so long,
it feels like a Sunday today.

00:51:13.744 --> 00:51:16.514
That's true.
Both of them love 'theplas' (pancakes).

00:51:16.882 --> 00:51:18.074
You know what...

00:51:18.154 --> 00:51:20.977
Serve these theplas
before Mahabharat starts.

00:51:21.796 --> 00:51:24.999
Tara. Hurry up,
Mahabharat's about to begin.

00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:25.987
Hello.

00:51:27.488 --> 00:51:28.288
Who is this?

00:51:28.368 --> 00:51:32.052
Hemant sir. Pandey from Delhi
from the Minister's Residence.

00:51:32.647 --> 00:51:34.339
I apologise for disturbing
you on a Sunday.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:36.674
Not at all, Mr. Pandey.

00:51:37.504 --> 00:51:39.936
Sundays are usual for people like us.

00:51:40.016 --> 00:51:41.642
How can I help you?

00:51:41.722 --> 00:51:44.560
Well, our sir needs
your blessings in the market

00:51:45.308 --> 00:51:48.133
and in-exchange I'll
give you political haven.

00:51:48.408 --> 00:51:49.674
And what is this haven called?

00:51:49.754 --> 00:51:50.774
Sanjeev Kohli.

00:51:51.183 --> 00:51:53.181
Member of Parliament SP. Kohli's son.

00:51:53.261 --> 00:51:56.161
He wants to release
IPOs of his company TelAir.

00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:58.731
So he wants to enter
the world of Telecomm.

00:51:59.423 --> 00:52:04.343
Hemant sir, you alone are not responsible
for the progress of this country.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.412
Okay then,
I'll arrange for your tickets.

00:52:08.798 --> 00:52:10.150
See you in Delhi.

00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:12.630
Viren.

00:52:13.032 --> 00:52:14.183
- Yes, mom.
- Is everything alright?

00:52:15.259 --> 00:52:16.401
All good.

00:52:19.771 --> 00:52:20.681
What happened?

00:52:23.094 --> 00:52:25.344
What can be better than this, mom?

00:52:26.064 --> 00:52:27.280
Exactly.

00:52:27.748 --> 00:52:30.711
The new house. The cars parked below.

00:52:31.469 --> 00:52:33.156
Isn't this all happening too soon?

00:52:33.935 --> 00:52:37.119
Mom, you know brother can't tread slow.

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.898
I know.

00:52:39.404 --> 00:52:40.789
Since he was in school.

00:52:41.413 --> 00:52:42.617
Even in school, he...

00:52:43.343 --> 00:52:44.919
Don't worry, mom.

00:52:45.779 --> 00:52:46.941
It won't happen again.

00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:48.839
I am there.

00:52:50.426 --> 00:52:51.938
Don't worry. Just watch.

00:52:56.352 --> 00:52:57.582
So when are you going to Delhi?

00:52:59.356 --> 00:53:00.437
So you heard.

00:53:10.423 --> 00:53:11.427
What happened?

00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:13.920
We've been married for two months.

00:53:14.439 --> 00:53:15.754
What about our honeymoon?

00:53:17.117 --> 00:53:18.872
We're going to America next month.

00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:21.941
Forget America,
I haven't seen Delhi yet.

00:53:23.038 --> 00:53:24.341
You're going to Delhi
the day after tomorrow.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:26.668
Take me along too.

00:53:27.338 --> 00:53:28.372
At least show me Delhi.

00:53:41.832 --> 00:53:44.594
Welcome, welcome, Hemant sir.
Welcome. Welcome, madam.

00:53:47.612 --> 00:53:48.866
These guys will help you check-in.

00:53:49.097 --> 00:53:51.095
There's a car parked
outside for your sight-seeing.

00:53:51.175 --> 00:53:52.515
I've also assigned two bodyguards.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.184
- Bodyguard?
- Yes, you need bodyguards.

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:59.088
This is Delhi,
Hemant sir, you got to flaunt it.

00:53:59.774 --> 00:54:01.891
See you in the evening
at Sanjeev sir's party.

00:54:01.971 --> 00:54:03.072
Be comfortable.

00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:09.407
'There is a lot of anger
among the people of the Indian economy'

00:54:09.487 --> 00:54:13.261
'on the new guidelines
of the parliamentary affairs committee.'

00:54:13.341 --> 00:54:17.303
'Due to which, there has been a sharp
reaction by various economists'

00:54:17.383 --> 00:54:20.065
'and also from the
Bombay Stock Exchange.'

00:54:20.145 --> 00:54:25.953
'Parliamentary Affairs Committee...'

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:37.303
"Why ask for my heart,
take my life instead."

00:54:38.552 --> 00:54:45.989
"Just give flight to my dreams."

00:54:47.414 --> 00:54:55.180
"Why ask for my heart,
take my life instead."

00:54:56.175 --> 00:55:03.205
"Just give flight to my dreams."

00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:12.447
"Even sweet nectar doesn't taste as good
as sweet as your memories."

00:55:12.527 --> 00:55:21.190
"Our love has scaled new heights."

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:25.575
"I prayed for love..."

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:29.415
"Prayed for your love."

00:55:29.972 --> 00:55:34.296
"I prayed for love..."

00:55:34.376 --> 00:55:38.674
"Prayed for your love."

00:55:39.754 --> 00:55:44.272
"You're no longer you,
I am no longer me."

00:55:44.352 --> 00:55:47.464
"Listen to each other's heart."

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:51.761
"I prayed for love..."

00:55:51.841 --> 00:55:56.223
"Prayed for your love."

00:55:56.303 --> 00:56:00.529
"I prayed for love..."

00:56:00.609 --> 00:56:06.199
"Prayed for your love."

00:56:24.038 --> 00:56:31.877
"Since the day I saw...
I feel lost myself."

00:56:32.361 --> 00:56:36.803
"Night and day you're in my thoughts."

00:56:36.883 --> 00:56:40.349
"But where am I?"

00:56:48.915 --> 00:56:57.789
"Yes. Since the day I saw...
I feel lost myself."

00:56:58.538 --> 00:57:02.997
"Night and day you're in my thoughts."

00:57:03.077 --> 00:57:05.983
"But where am I?"

00:57:06.063 --> 00:57:15.018
"Even sweet nectar doesn't taste as good
as sweet as your memories."

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:23.106
"Our love has scaled new heights."

00:57:23.451 --> 00:57:27.772
"I prayed for love..."

00:57:27.852 --> 00:57:31.609
"Prayed for your love."

00:57:32.274 --> 00:57:36.493
"I prayed for love..."

00:57:36.573 --> 00:57:41.067
"Prayed for your love."

00:57:41.769 --> 00:57:46.375
"You're no longer you,
I am no longer me."

00:57:46.455 --> 00:57:49.656
"Listen to each other's heart."

00:57:49.736 --> 00:57:53.926
"I prayed for love..."

00:57:54.006 --> 00:57:57.750
"Prayed for your love."

00:57:58.467 --> 00:58:02.703
"I prayed for love..."

00:58:02.783 --> 00:58:08.746
"Prayed for your love."

00:58:11.509 --> 00:58:19.352
"I prayed for love..."

00:58:22.408 --> 00:58:27.648
"I prayed for love..."

00:58:30.342 --> 00:58:33.136
Others are just alive
it's these guys who are living it up.

00:58:33.869 --> 00:58:36.527
These Delhi people...
they live life like the kings

00:58:37.031 --> 00:58:40.899
Even if they do,
do they have to dress like one?

00:58:41.837 --> 00:58:44.439
What you see is what sells.

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:46.810
And if you have it, then flaunt it.

00:58:47.267 --> 00:58:49.494
You're equal to each one here.

00:58:50.167 --> 00:58:52.186
And you've as much as anyone here.

00:58:53.899 --> 00:58:58.097
Wear your jewellery to the next party.

00:58:58.177 --> 00:58:59.177
And then watch...

00:58:59.873 --> 00:59:01.666
We're not one of them, Hemant.

00:59:02.251 --> 00:59:03.228
Hi, Hemant.

00:59:03.308 --> 00:59:05.673
- I am Pranay Oberoi. Classic Motors.
- Yes.

00:59:05.753 --> 00:59:06.995
- Big fan.
- Thank you.

00:59:07.075 --> 00:59:08.706
- Come, join us.
- We will.

00:59:08.786 --> 00:59:09.986
- You will. Come.
- Yeah!

00:59:12.585 --> 00:59:13.659
Pranay Oberoi.

00:59:15.743 --> 00:59:20.312
We may not be one of them,
but they want us to be.

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:23.605
Do you know why? Because they all know

00:59:24.834 --> 00:59:30.050
I can make much more
then what their entire ancestors made.

00:59:31.312 --> 00:59:32.388
Hemant sir...

00:59:33.043 --> 00:59:34.717
Hemant sir, Sanjeev sir is calling you.

00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:36.795
Yes... Come...

00:59:37.994 --> 00:59:40.183
Just you, please.

00:59:44.033 --> 00:59:44.894
Come...

00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:46.162
Come...

00:59:53.048 --> 00:59:55.095
Sanjeev sir... Mr. Hemant.

00:59:57.459 --> 01:00:00.352
Welcome, Mr. Hemant, welcome.

01:00:00.887 --> 01:00:02.689
Welcome to Delhi.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.771
Firstly Mr. Hemant, congratulations.

01:00:09.396 --> 01:00:13.524
Your working style is
as unique as it is aggressive.

01:00:14.594 --> 01:00:15.809
Right foot first.

01:00:20.902 --> 01:00:26.529
You've helped so many companies manage
their operations in the stock market

01:00:26.609 --> 01:00:29.435
I would like you
to help us in a similar way.

01:00:31.271 --> 01:00:32.187
Go ahead.

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:36.534
Mr. Hemant, what do you
think is the future of India?

01:00:38.752 --> 01:00:41.229
It's the telecom industry.

01:00:41.919 --> 01:00:46.937
If you join us and I promise
you the sky will be the limit.

01:00:47.408 --> 01:00:51.382
You can't even begin
to imagine the growth potential.

01:00:51.977 --> 01:00:56.398
India's top 10 industrialists...
whenever you want.

01:00:57.777 --> 01:01:03.403
Mr. Sanjeev, even I want to
build a financially strong economy.

01:01:03.862 --> 01:01:10.439
But for my ideas, I don't need
industrialists, but political support.

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:16.897
Mr. Hemant,
you just made my job a lot easier.

01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:20.524
Dad's there.

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:25.059
Anyone... anytime... your call.

01:01:25.421 --> 01:01:26.221
What do you say?

01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:27.966
Let's cheer for that.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:29.511
Scotch?

01:01:56.806 --> 01:01:58.295
'Aren't you drinking?'

01:01:58.375 --> 01:01:59.332
'I will'

01:02:00.214 --> 01:02:02.336
'only when I've the best quality.'

01:02:07.961 --> 01:02:09.399
TelAir's magic worked.

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:11.189
Hemant's magic worked.

01:02:11.891 --> 01:02:16.067
Those who were in the stock market,
their pockets got a little heavier.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:21.744
This month I made 300,000 rupees.

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:34.787
People would buy shares
when Hemant would raise his hands.

01:02:35.081 --> 01:02:37.260
Viren, Kantilal speaking.

01:02:38.174 --> 01:02:39.624
"The one and only Big Bull."

01:02:39.704 --> 01:02:41.231
I've called so many times.

01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:43.500
Let me speak with Hemant just once.

01:02:53.546 --> 01:02:57.026
The world began to change
on Hemant's bidding.

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.807
"The one and only Big Bull."

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.498
He had started manipulating share
prices, and I started writing about him.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.331
This man.

01:03:11.894 --> 01:03:12.712
Do you know who he is?

01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:14.939
He's the Amitabh Bachchan
(superstar) of the share market.

01:03:15.019 --> 01:03:16.552
His name is Hemant Shah.

01:03:36.411 --> 01:03:38.825
Some of my boss' friends
work in his office.

01:03:39.259 --> 01:03:40.676
They keep giving tips.

01:03:41.274 --> 01:03:43.244
When the boss sells, I do too.

01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:45.316
Last week I made 7000 rupees.

01:03:58.881 --> 01:03:59.882
What is it?

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.431
Meera Rao's fifth article about you.

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.770
She says Hemant Shah is just a bubble.

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:07.280
I don't know what her problem is.

01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:09.567
Bubble.

01:04:11.419 --> 01:04:13.799
I thought I was like an earthquake.

01:04:14.104 --> 01:04:15.103
Disaster.

01:04:18.124 --> 01:04:19.045
Okay, fine.

01:04:20.044 --> 01:04:25.702
Give a front-page ad
in next week's newspaper...

01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:30.494
The title will be Hemant Shah is a Liar.

01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:32.720
She is calling us a liar, isn't she?

01:04:33.384 --> 01:04:35.642
We'll answer all of her questions.

01:04:35.904 --> 01:04:36.853
What else.

01:04:45.072 --> 01:04:47.645
See this... he's the real big bull.

01:04:47.725 --> 01:04:49.482
That Meera took five jabs at him

01:04:49.562 --> 01:04:52.351
but he knocked her out
with a single punch.

01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:55.170
Now we will have
to work with four hands.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.552
- Get the Indian Oil file quickly.
- Right away.

01:04:59.615 --> 01:05:01.585
Look! We have progressed.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.634
[chanting prayers]

01:05:13.714 --> 01:05:18.247
[chanting prayers]

01:05:18.327 --> 01:05:23.375
Everytime I say 'swaha',
you'll pour the incense in the fire

01:05:23.455 --> 01:05:25.232
- Okay, priest.
- with these three fingers.

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.072
Okay?

01:05:26.152 --> 01:05:29.520
[chanting prayers]

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.217
[chanting prayers]

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:36.640
[chanting prayers]

01:05:58.486 --> 01:06:00.605
Meera Rao called again.

01:06:01.226 --> 01:06:03.639
She's challenging you to an interview.
But I said no.

01:06:04.774 --> 01:06:07.209
But didn't we decide
we'll do the interview?

01:06:07.949 --> 01:06:10.635
She's trying to use
your name to gain some fame.

01:06:12.854 --> 01:06:15.102
The entire country's
making money using my name.

01:06:16.462 --> 01:06:19.143
If she wants to gain some fame,
then let her.

01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:30.087
'This ancient land
of India regains its glory'

01:06:30.167 --> 01:06:33.188
'and rightful place
in the Economy of our nation.'

01:06:33.268 --> 01:06:35.740
'This budget represents
the contribution...'

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:39.030
'It's being believed
that the liberalisation policy'

01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.524
'has been completely
inducted in the country.'

01:06:40.604 --> 01:06:43.214
'And the product
which are presently accepting'

01:06:43.294 --> 01:06:45.830
'10% rate of interest instead of 15.'

01:06:48.918 --> 01:06:51.418
Excuse me, is Viren Shah in?

01:06:51.498 --> 01:06:53.516
- Your name?
- What did I ask?

01:06:54.079 --> 01:06:56.081
Is Viren Shah in the office?

01:06:56.511 --> 01:06:57.568
Yes, sir.

01:06:57.966 --> 01:06:59.191
Come in, everyone.

01:06:59.271 --> 01:07:00.351
- Rashid.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:00.431 --> 01:07:01.955
Freeze the Accounts department.

01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:08.511
Come on, remove it.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.705
Calm down everyone and listen carefully.

01:07:12.785 --> 01:07:14.469
- Move.
- Pass this.

01:07:14.775 --> 01:07:16.347
The office has been raided.

01:07:16.627 --> 01:07:18.985
- Come on, get out.
- What is going on?

01:07:19.393 --> 01:07:21.329
- Where is Viren?
- In the office!

01:07:22.475 --> 01:07:24.744
No one's going to touch the computer,
file, or telephone.

01:07:24.824 --> 01:07:26.559
- Keep it down.
- No one will ask anything.

01:07:26.639 --> 01:07:28.383
Please bring that blue file.

01:07:29.674 --> 01:07:31.554
Sir, we're ready for you.

01:07:31.634 --> 01:07:33.897
Three. Two. One. Go.

01:07:34.726 --> 01:07:36.302
Hello, and welcome.

01:07:36.382 --> 01:07:38.944
My today's guest is the man
who's all over the media.

01:07:39.024 --> 01:07:41.270
And he's known as The Big Bull.

01:07:55.386 --> 01:07:57.821
Seize everything.
Copy everything. Fast!

01:07:58.304 --> 01:07:59.300
Rashid.

01:08:04.212 --> 01:08:06.695
Where are the records
for this entry of Indian Oil?

01:08:06.775 --> 01:08:08.989
Where is the entry
for this 5 crore rupees?

01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.953
Atul.

01:08:10.489 --> 01:08:11.658
Nikhil, did you find anything?

01:08:12.007 --> 01:08:12.954
Nothing.

01:08:13.897 --> 01:08:16.792
Okay. Get aggressive.

01:08:17.183 --> 01:08:20.619
Threaten, abuse, do whatever you can.

01:08:20.699 --> 01:08:22.987
I need the information at any cost.

01:08:23.067 --> 01:08:25.433
- But that's against the rules.
- Forget the rules, Nikhil.

01:08:25.513 --> 01:08:28.404
I need information, that's it. Clear?

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.289
Right?

01:08:34.567 --> 01:08:37.910
Mr. Hemant,
our stock market is at an all-time high

01:08:38.521 --> 01:08:40.327
with a huge contribution from you.

01:08:41.007 --> 01:08:44.525
But this sudden boom looks artificial.

01:08:45.099 --> 01:08:46.533
What's your comment on it?

01:08:56.879 --> 01:09:01.656
The shares of our big companies
are with their owner's families.

01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:03.622
That's why they are undervalued.

01:09:05.119 --> 01:09:08.764
If they release some of their stocks,
only then will their valuation increase.

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:12.917
This way, the company didn't just lower
the net worth of their companies

01:09:12.997 --> 01:09:15.355
but also of the country.

01:09:16.811 --> 01:09:19.680
Do you know
that the gold reserves of our country

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.611
which has a population of 60 crore

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.524
is mortgaged with the Bank of England
and Bank of Japan.

01:09:25.543 --> 01:09:29.726
I want to ask Ms. Meera,
isn't this embarrassing?

01:09:36.976 --> 01:09:38.925
Go handle outside. I'll handle it here.

01:09:50.373 --> 01:09:51.738
Couldn't you inform me earlier?

01:09:53.102 --> 01:09:54.338
We had a deal.

01:09:55.129 --> 01:09:56.337
Who did you make this payment too?

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.784
Didn't we have a deal?

01:09:57.864 --> 01:09:59.245
Answer me!

01:10:00.524 --> 01:10:01.845
Who did you make this payment too?

01:10:04.973 --> 01:10:07.519
I believe your replacement
cost theory is right

01:10:08.135 --> 01:10:10.696
but I don't think that can bring
such a boom in the market.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.340
Maybe it can cause something else.

01:10:16.772 --> 01:10:17.927
Hope.

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:21.726
Small word,
but it's bigger than it looks.

01:10:21.974 --> 01:10:23.297
The world clings on it.

01:10:23.562 --> 01:10:25.224
Please, Mr. Hemant, logic...

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.541
I am coming to the logic, Ms. Meera.

01:10:26.621 --> 01:10:29.751
You want to hear it in your words.
Let's explain it in her terms.

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:34.831
The new boom has ushered
in the hope of liberalisation.

01:10:36.212 --> 01:10:39.532
Believe me,
foreign investors are going to come.

01:10:39.612 --> 01:10:41.197
They will invest their money here.

01:10:41.876 --> 01:10:43.820
The industry will see a great surge.

01:10:44.444 --> 01:10:46.844
The valuation of current
will increase many folds.

01:10:47.491 --> 01:10:50.237
You're watching
the boom of India's hope.

01:10:50.317 --> 01:10:52.992
Mr. Hemant, let's talk about
the stock market and share prices first.

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:57.331
Tell me... a share that cost 20 rupees
has now reached 200 rupees.

01:10:57.781 --> 01:11:00.020
Where did the money come from?

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.021
Did this money come
from the 'bank of hope'?

01:11:02.566 --> 01:11:04.897
Even you know
that these prices are too inflated.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.838
It's just money play.

01:11:10.775 --> 01:11:13.077
Even 200 rupees is too less, Ms. Meera.

01:11:14.787 --> 01:11:16.784
Let me ask you a question. Okay?

01:11:17.488 --> 01:11:21.137
Ten years ago you bought
some shares for 20 rupees.

01:11:21.646 --> 01:11:24.501
And now that value of
those shares is 200 rupees.

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:28.035
Will you still ask me questions or sell
those shares for 200 rupees and party?

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:49.483
Why has this figure been scratched here?

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.870
What's the original figure?

01:12:17.295 --> 01:12:18.673
No matter what you say, Mr. Hemant

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:22.473
but I believe this steep increase
in share prices is not normal at all.

01:12:22.923 --> 01:12:25.330
It can prove to be a disaster
for ordinary people.

01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:28.735
Currently, you're the
biggest player in this market.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.561
What is your advice
for ordinary investors?

01:12:34.862 --> 01:12:36.252
Just that...

01:12:38.277 --> 01:12:40.137
We stopped thinking big.

01:12:43.339 --> 01:12:46.346
The British didn't just take
the Kohinoor (diamond)

01:12:46.735 --> 01:12:49.689
but even our ideologies,
our self-confidence, everything.

01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:54.175
I want to teach India to think big.

01:12:54.255 --> 01:12:57.407
I want to tell our people to think big.

01:12:57.952 --> 01:13:01.245
Don't give them dreams
that may never come true.

01:13:02.007 --> 01:13:02.963
Look, ma'am...

01:13:04.407 --> 01:13:07.015
He'll give us dreams
and also make them come true.

01:13:07.347 --> 01:13:11.990
And you know, there weren't so
many opportunities until four-years-ago.

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:14.536
Either property or gold.

01:13:14.616 --> 01:13:18.791
Thanks to Hemant sir we can
double our money in a couple of months.

01:13:18.871 --> 01:13:20.836
And we also get what we want.

01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:22.851
Like a fridge, TV, or motorbike!

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.440
And also go on holidays.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.844
Another thing, ma'am!

01:13:26.305 --> 01:13:30.896
Thanks to Hemant sir, even an
ordinary man can invest in the market.

01:13:30.976 --> 01:13:32.998
And buy shares of any company.

01:13:33.348 --> 01:13:37.815
For the first time,
even feel a part of the Indian economy.

01:13:37.895 --> 01:13:40.865
Otherwise...
only a handful of businessmen

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.194
and a couple of brokers
used to play this game.

01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:49.113
Look madam, I am selling my gold,
property, everything.

01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:50.911
Only to invest in stocks.

01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:53.510
And Hemant sir's word is the ultimate.

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:56.982
If he says that stock prices will go up,
means it will go up.

01:14:27.658 --> 01:14:29.996
I saved you today,
but I can't do it everyday.

01:14:30.337 --> 01:14:33.561
Then you keep writing
any amount of numbers on paper

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:35.144
but it won't help you.

01:14:35.501 --> 01:14:38.375
Tell your brother that
he's flying too high...

01:14:38.455 --> 01:14:40.065
And that too without a parachute.

01:14:40.497 --> 01:14:43.180
If he tries to land,
it'll be a crash-landing

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.496
straight into jail. Understand.

01:14:47.972 --> 01:14:51.997
You see, madam,
earlier businessmen like me

01:14:52.345 --> 01:14:56.929
would keep 75-90% shares
in their name or their family.

01:14:57.009 --> 01:14:59.803
We had to take a loan from
the bank to expand our business.

01:15:00.153 --> 01:15:04.912
Thanks to Hemant sir,
we didn't just learn to make profit

01:15:04.992 --> 01:15:09.155
but also on how to increase
the value of our shares by selling them.

01:15:11.538 --> 01:15:14.744
Now we feel we've got our India back.

01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:17.898
Hemant! Hemant!

01:15:17.978 --> 01:15:20.741
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:23.281
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

01:15:23.361 --> 01:15:25.799
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

01:15:25.879 --> 01:15:28.553
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

01:15:28.633 --> 01:15:31.251
Big Bull! Big Bull! Big Bull!

01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:33.874
Big Bull! Big Bull! Big Bull!

01:15:33.954 --> 01:15:37.216
Big Bull! Big Bull! Big Bull!

01:15:38.504 --> 01:15:39.672
'Are you ashamed?'

01:15:40.419 --> 01:15:41.726
'You've humiliated all of us.'

01:15:45.268 --> 01:15:47.385
'Otherwise,
God knows what else he would've done.'

01:15:47.465 --> 01:15:48.694
'Please...'

01:15:48.774 --> 01:15:50.170
- 'Get out now.
- No, no...'

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.686
'He made a mistake.
He won't do it again.'

01:15:52.766 --> 01:15:55.051
- 'Please, papa...
-Tell him. Tell him.'

01:15:55.366 --> 01:15:56.786
'You're going to sleep outside tonight.'

01:15:56.866 --> 01:15:58.630
- No one's going to feed him.
- No.

01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:01.180
Hemant, please... don't hit him.

01:16:20.049 --> 01:16:22.602
- What happened?
- Hemant sir, any tip?

01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:36.281
Do you have a car?

01:16:36.707 --> 01:16:39.478
Car? You must be joking, sir?

01:16:42.387 --> 01:16:43.503
Do you want one?

01:16:50.124 --> 01:16:53.545
Before you buy a car, buy a tyre.

01:16:57.596 --> 01:16:59.686
And only of KVG.

01:17:18.823 --> 01:17:19.890
What?

01:17:21.052 --> 01:17:22.706
This IT raid was just a warning.

01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:24.942
I had a personal chat with the officer.

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.155
We should slow down now.

01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:34.221
I can't tread slow, Viren.

01:17:36.763 --> 01:17:38.872
If the government and
system want to catch me

01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:41.452
then they will have
to increase their speed.

01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:43.976
Where will you take Mile High?

01:17:44.814 --> 01:17:45.881
It's enough.

01:17:47.249 --> 01:17:49.702
If this continues I am telling you,
I'll resign.

01:17:52.479 --> 01:17:54.237
We already have so much.

01:17:56.966 --> 01:17:58.919
You're issuing cheques
worth crores of rupees.

01:17:59.256 --> 01:18:00.931
I don't know what
banks we're dealing with.

01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:02.527
What companies are we dealing with?

01:18:03.271 --> 01:18:04.538
Maybe you don't know either.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.217
The banks don't know
where their money is going.

01:18:07.297 --> 01:18:09.485
They are all happy. Everyone thinks
they are making a lot of money.

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:14.081
This is not normal. I am scared.

01:18:15.006 --> 01:18:16.649
I want a normal life, brother.

01:18:17.185 --> 01:18:19.302
We have a family.
We'll have kids tomorrow.

01:18:22.073 --> 01:18:23.578
Why don't you understand?

01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:26.175
Last time when you did
something like this

01:18:26.255 --> 01:18:27.886
you had to sleep on your footwear.
Remember?

01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:35.311
That won't happen again. Don't worry.

01:18:36.702 --> 01:18:37.808
Because I have

01:18:41.261 --> 01:18:43.019
the ace of cards up my sleeve.

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:49.576
Who? The CM?

01:18:50.494 --> 01:18:51.755
Bigger than him.

01:18:52.906 --> 01:18:54.312
Finance Secretary?

01:18:56.742 --> 01:18:57.784
Finance Minister?

01:19:01.312 --> 01:19:02.811
Not the king of cards...

01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:05.499
I said ace.

01:19:39.315 --> 01:19:41.352
I'll be right back.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.614
Take.

01:19:50.671 --> 01:19:51.490
Take...

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.096
There's no need for this.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:00.534
You've been handing out
a lot by yourself these days.

01:20:00.614 --> 01:20:04.527
You see, where did the Robin hood
inside me have woken?

01:20:05.074 --> 01:20:05.953
In the stock market.

01:20:06.033 --> 01:20:10.113
Whatever that's inside you...
will one day send you to jail.

01:20:10.193 --> 01:20:12.725
I see...
did you bring in some new law?

01:20:12.805 --> 01:20:15.981
I haven't... the law already exists.

01:20:17.038 --> 01:20:19.262
And nothing will help you.

01:20:20.031 --> 01:20:22.185
I've already given you this advice once.

01:20:22.691 --> 01:20:23.920
I won't give again.

01:20:26.031 --> 01:20:28.883
A man who makes money
from others' failures

01:20:29.755 --> 01:20:31.604
I don't need his advice.

01:20:32.692 --> 01:20:33.747
What did you say?

01:20:34.728 --> 01:20:38.399
Doesn't matter how many times you
come to pray to this temple, Malpani

01:20:39.639 --> 01:20:41.304
that won't change the fact

01:20:41.857 --> 01:20:46.436
that you make money
when the share market slumps.

01:20:48.324 --> 01:20:52.088
The man who prays
the down fall of the share market.

01:20:53.006 --> 01:20:53.981
That's you.

01:20:55.037 --> 01:20:57.918
Your success lies in others' failure.

01:20:58.930 --> 01:20:59.880
But...

01:21:00.806 --> 01:21:06.716
Today when the market's going up,
only one man is losing.

01:21:07.326 --> 01:21:09.132
Even I can make small talk.

01:21:09.974 --> 01:21:11.136
And since I'm from the market

01:21:11.754 --> 01:21:15.097
I know this language which
you'll understand better.

01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:21.084
But since we're in a temple,
I'll give you one piece of advice.

01:21:21.632 --> 01:21:27.133
When a man goes up, up and up...
he comes down, down and down.

01:21:29.183 --> 01:21:31.014
And falls flat in the end.

01:21:31.421 --> 01:21:32.867
Remember that.

01:21:34.547 --> 01:21:35.971
I know how to fly...

01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:39.290
Learn to look up.

01:21:48.428 --> 01:21:50.914
Let's go, we'll finish this tomorrow.

01:21:51.257 --> 01:21:53.197
Give me 10 more minutes,
then we'll leave.

01:21:53.277 --> 01:21:54.746
What isn't tallying?

01:21:58.029 --> 01:21:59.296
Something's odd.

01:22:00.646 --> 01:22:04.074
We've Bank Receipts,
but I don't see the money in the books.

01:22:04.154 --> 01:22:05.363
Is that all?

01:22:05.443 --> 01:22:07.444
Forget it. We'll tally it tomorrow.
How does it matter?

01:22:09.589 --> 01:22:11.939
565 crores are missing.

01:22:12.603 --> 01:22:13.754
Are you joking?

01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:18.138
- Check it yourself.
- There might be some mistake.

01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:28.243
What's this, Meera?

01:22:28.707 --> 01:22:30.159
- What is what?
- Seriously.

01:22:31.715 --> 01:22:35.381
Now you're implying that Hemant
has links with the underworld.

01:22:35.693 --> 01:22:38.058
I am just questioning
where he's getting funds from.

01:22:38.367 --> 01:22:39.717
Somebody has to be funding him.

01:22:40.128 --> 01:22:43.030
The underworld is already funding films.
They can fund Hemant too.

01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:44.342
They can.

01:22:45.777 --> 01:22:47.809
Come here. Come, come.

01:22:49.713 --> 01:22:51.135
You see the construction cranes?

01:22:51.888 --> 01:22:55.080
I spent my entire life in this city.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.699
And I'll be honest with you.

01:22:57.903 --> 01:23:01.356
I've never seen this city
change so drastically.

01:23:03.231 --> 01:23:06.083
It's like... India is reborn.

01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:12.609
If Hemant is wrong,
then all this is wrong.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.112
Hemant is definitely wrong

01:23:16.986 --> 01:23:19.266
but you decide about the rest.

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:28.615
Cheers!

01:23:31.636 --> 01:23:32.977
Please come, sir.

01:23:34.922 --> 01:23:38.970
Wow! She's more beautiful
than she looks in films.

01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.235
- Isn't she?
- Yes.

01:23:44.315 --> 01:23:45.544
And that Vikram.

01:23:45.933 --> 01:23:47.691
We Gujaratis are on a roll.

01:23:50.207 --> 01:23:53.394
By the way,
Hemant, do you have any regrets

01:23:53.774 --> 01:23:56.691
about marrying an ordinary girl
even though you're so rich.

01:23:59.362 --> 01:24:01.697
I hadn't thought about it yet
but now when I look at them

01:24:01.777 --> 01:24:04.412
I think I should've thought about it.

01:24:05.099 --> 01:24:06.214
Hemant!

01:24:11.863 --> 01:24:15.888
By the way, Bombay is now
entirely controlled by Gujarat.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.531
They can buy one half,
and we can buy the other.

01:24:18.611 --> 01:24:22.020
Oh yes, last week my
friend Anjali was telling me

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.501
that Solanki will be
the first billionaire of India.

01:24:26.201 --> 01:24:27.989
- Really?
- Why didn't you interrupt Anjali?

01:24:28.069 --> 01:24:29.087
About what?

01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:31.394
The billionaire part.

01:24:31.474 --> 01:24:34.538
But she is right.
What did she say wrong?

01:24:42.203 --> 01:24:43.951
You should know the truth.

01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:47.972
I'll be India's first billionaire.

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:50.687
Me.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.863
Not him or anyone else.

01:25:07.475 --> 01:25:10.632
Sir! Mr. Venkateshwar
has called for you.

01:25:11.048 --> 01:25:12.911
- Mr. Venkateshwar?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:12.991 --> 01:25:14.568
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:15.696 --> 01:25:18.684
Mr. Viren, it's a catastrophe.

01:25:20.472 --> 01:25:24.424
The bank found out
that the money is missing.

01:25:25.415 --> 01:25:31.549
Please tell Hemant to return
all the money right now.

01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:33.489
How much money is missing?

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:36.164
565 crores.

01:25:36.244 --> 01:25:42.528
Please, Viren. Tell him immediately,
otherwise...I'll be ruined.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:44.676
Please.

01:25:44.756 --> 01:25:46.308
Please, for God's sake.

01:26:05.496 --> 01:26:06.648
Good to see you.

01:26:07.481 --> 01:26:09.358
Your face is everywhere.

01:26:10.003 --> 01:26:11.841
Dad was just praising you yesterday.

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:15.946
Wow... great ride.

01:26:17.885 --> 01:26:18.885
You like it?

01:26:21.157 --> 01:26:22.224
Keep it.

01:26:23.234 --> 01:26:24.310
I'll buy two more.

01:26:26.634 --> 01:26:27.962
Tell papa, I said hi.

01:26:53.973 --> 01:26:57.187
Hey... where did you find this?

01:26:57.439 --> 01:26:59.564
It was stuck under the xerox machine.

01:27:01.903 --> 01:27:03.524
Well done, Amit.

01:27:10.614 --> 01:27:16.808
Hemant Shah receives
his first BR on Monday

01:27:17.191 --> 01:27:18.512
which he

01:27:20.457 --> 01:27:25.097
doesn't dispatch to any other bank until

01:27:26.024 --> 01:27:27.990
the second week's Thursday or Friday.

01:27:30.076 --> 01:27:35.482
And we get to see this
pattern in every transaction.

01:27:37.625 --> 01:27:38.610
Hey!

01:27:41.692 --> 01:27:46.252
It was all much ado about nothing.

01:27:47.079 --> 01:27:49.050
Rascal...

01:27:50.188 --> 01:27:55.554
We thought this money's
coming from the Middle-East

01:27:56.524 --> 01:28:00.421
the Underworld, Politicians, but...

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:07.143
This turned out to be
money from our banks.

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.636
I know how to clip wings.

01:28:18.691 --> 01:28:21.938
Get used to falling, Hemant Shah.

01:28:23.452 --> 01:28:27.664
'Don't travel near the door.
And don't try to...'

01:28:37.392 --> 01:28:40.059
Hi, I am Ashima.

01:28:40.435 --> 01:28:42.969
Aren't you Meera Rao, the journalist?

01:28:43.515 --> 01:28:44.347
Yes.

01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:51.729
By the way,
what school did you do journalism from?

01:28:53.018 --> 01:28:54.648
Are you interviewing a journalist?

01:28:55.108 --> 01:28:58.541
- Are you interested in journalism?
- Yes, a little.

01:29:00.883 --> 01:29:06.140
I wanted to ask
why you chose financial people?

01:29:07.992 --> 01:29:09.356
I just had an interest.

01:29:10.135 --> 01:29:12.279
That's my station.

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:16.388
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

01:29:28.537 --> 01:29:29.511
Take.

01:29:34.623 --> 01:29:38.305
'And finally,
I received a big tip in this case.'

01:29:38.385 --> 01:29:41.674
'NBI,
from where a lot of money was missing.'

01:29:41.754 --> 01:29:45.425
'It's manager Venkateshwar
is the key to Hemant's vault.'

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:22.062
Meera, speaking.
Call Sudeep from room no. 20, please.

01:30:23.724 --> 01:30:25.031
Hurry up.

01:30:34.285 --> 01:30:35.558
From now on, you'll stand downstairs.

01:30:35.638 --> 01:30:38.453
And tell me when
Venkateshwar arrives. Okay?

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.218
Ma'am. Ma'am.

01:30:45.929 --> 01:30:47.543
Mr. Raman. Senior manager.

01:30:47.623 --> 01:30:49.871
- Your name?
- Meera Rao, India Times.

01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:50.883
Please, wait.

01:30:52.172 --> 01:30:53.468
The money will come back.

01:30:54.036 --> 01:30:56.818
We got 135 crores back.
The rest will come too.

01:30:57.131 --> 01:30:58.273
But, sir...

01:31:01.098 --> 01:31:01.911
Yes.

01:31:02.438 --> 01:31:04.068
Hello, sir, Meera Rao here to see you.

01:31:04.148 --> 01:31:05.743
She wants to talk to you.

01:31:06.666 --> 01:31:08.570
Send her in after two minutes.

01:31:10.312 --> 01:31:11.949
You must wait for two minutes ma'am.

01:31:12.429 --> 01:31:13.994
His office is on the first floor,
isn't it?

01:31:14.074 --> 01:31:15.234
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:31:15.314 --> 01:31:16.301
Wait a minute.

01:31:17.695 --> 01:31:21.079
Go now. I've an important meeting.

01:31:25.465 --> 01:31:26.277
Hello.

01:31:26.862 --> 01:31:29.079
- Sir.
- Checkout of the hotel.

01:31:30.062 --> 01:31:32.493
Stay hidden in your hometown
for two weeks.

01:31:33.146 --> 01:31:36.204
- Don't answer anyone's calls.
- I'll leave tonight, sir.

01:31:38.649 --> 01:31:40.191
I'll come straight to the point.

01:31:40.271 --> 01:31:43.278
I know about the missing money.
565 crores.

01:31:43.358 --> 01:31:45.814
And I'm doing a story on it.
I need your statement.

01:31:46.276 --> 01:31:48.002
Tea or coffee, Meera?

01:31:48.704 --> 01:31:50.014
Let's just get to the point.

01:31:56.544 --> 01:31:58.974
Someone gave you wrong information.

01:31:59.855 --> 01:32:01.429
There is no money missing.

01:32:03.193 --> 01:32:04.230
Look Meera

01:32:05.426 --> 01:32:11.175
banks invest around 60 billion
within themselves.

01:32:13.207 --> 01:32:16.484
And reconciliation takes time.

01:32:17.422 --> 01:32:18.729
There's nothing wrong.

01:32:22.048 --> 01:32:25.219
- Sir is not taking it seriously.
- I also feel the same.

01:32:42.682 --> 01:32:45.916
'I was on the right track.
The money was actually money.'

01:32:46.554 --> 01:32:48.616
'I just had to crack Venkateshwar.'

01:32:49.759 --> 01:32:50.942
Hello, ma'am.

01:33:06.793 --> 01:33:09.165
- Yes?
- Mr. Venkateshwar, my name is Rama Mir.

01:33:09.245 --> 01:33:10.901
- Madam...
- I am the bank's lawyer.

01:33:10.981 --> 01:33:13.838
The news has reached the media,
so the bank's sent me to you.

01:33:14.179 --> 01:33:15.592
But, ma'am...

01:33:16.637 --> 01:33:18.816
Don't worry,
I won't tell anyone anything.

01:33:19.113 --> 01:33:21.110
A doctor never tells
anyone about his patients

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:22.824
nor does a lawyer about his clients.

01:33:23.652 --> 01:33:25.259
Attorney-client privilege.

01:33:26.707 --> 01:33:29.071
It's okay, you can trust me.

01:33:30.726 --> 01:33:31.824
Okay.

01:33:34.124 --> 01:33:36.905
I'll tell you.

01:33:37.298 --> 01:33:40.206
Hemant is a very smart man, madam.

01:33:40.286 --> 01:33:43.909
He took advantage of
the banking system's weakness.

01:33:45.799 --> 01:33:51.552
This is Bank A, Bank B, Bank C

01:33:52.389 --> 01:33:55.161
and Bank D.

01:33:55.927 --> 01:34:00.532
Bank A gives a loan
to Bank B for two weeks.

01:34:00.925 --> 01:34:04.155
But through broker Hemant.

01:34:05.581 --> 01:34:08.663
Two weeks later when
it's time to return the loan

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:11.844
then Hemant takes a loan from Bank C

01:34:11.924 --> 01:34:13.347
and gives to Bank B

01:34:13.988 --> 01:34:17.772
then gives Bank C's loan from Bank D.

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.889
And gives Bank D's loan from Bank B.

01:34:20.969 --> 01:34:23.747
And then from this bank and so on.

01:34:24.395 --> 01:34:26.448
Then he's just rotating
the bank's money.

01:34:26.528 --> 01:34:27.577
What's the issue?

01:34:28.326 --> 01:34:30.850
He's not just rotating the money.

01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:35.106
He's investing all
the money in stock markets.

01:34:35.186 --> 01:34:37.603
The share prices are increasing

01:34:37.683 --> 01:34:40.903
and he's enjoying all the profit.

01:34:41.602 --> 01:34:47.557
Keeping the bank's money
for two week's is not a big deal.

01:34:49.832 --> 01:34:54.659
But investing that money in
the stock market is absolutely illegal.

01:34:56.507 --> 01:34:59.080
There are numerous banks,
countless cash.

01:34:59.656 --> 01:35:05.527
Reconciliation takes a lot of time,
and Hemant knew that.

01:35:06.054 --> 01:35:09.126
And he's making a fortune
by taking advantage of this.

01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:16.021
It all started with a few millions.

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.994
But his greediness grew many folds

01:35:20.074 --> 01:35:26.766
and he has to return
565 crores to the bank.

01:35:28.479 --> 01:35:31.592
Wait a second. Wait a second.
The cheques that you give to the broker

01:35:31.672 --> 01:35:33.717
I mean, where are the agreements?

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:44.472
Oh, God!

01:35:52.528 --> 01:35:59.788
It's entirely
the banking system's mistake.

01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:02.480
Absolutely.

01:36:03.805 --> 01:36:06.632
Hemant's name is on the cheques.

01:36:09.084 --> 01:36:14.292
The banking system doesn't
have a specific law.

01:36:16.995 --> 01:36:21.773
Hemant knew about this grey area

01:36:21.853 --> 01:36:25.551
and Hemant's making a fortune
taking advantage of it.

01:36:27.024 --> 01:36:30.909
Imagine that the banking system

01:36:31.707 --> 01:36:38.239
itself gifted this scam
to Hemant on a plate.

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:43.175
And it did not stop here,
the worst part was...

01:36:44.512 --> 01:36:47.823
He started issuing fake BRs.

01:36:48.403 --> 01:36:55.332
There's real BR's and fake BR's
circulated in the market.

01:36:55.412 --> 01:36:57.200
It's circulated.

01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:05.318
And we're unable to check, find
out the original from the fake ones.

01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:13.899
How much has Hemant returned
from the 565 crores?

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.923
135 crores.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.850
And where did Hemant
get this 135 crores?

01:37:25.775 --> 01:37:28.755
Central Housing Bank. CHB.

01:37:30.199 --> 01:37:32.722
So that's where he got 135 crores.

01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:37.017
But how did Hemant get access to CHB?

01:37:38.314 --> 01:37:40.143
It's the country's treasury!

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.706
Have a biscuit?

01:37:58.786 --> 01:38:01.650
I wish they were made of gold instead.

01:38:01.730 --> 01:38:04.240
- Sir!
- Meet, Mr. Manu Maalpani.

01:38:05.642 --> 01:38:06.488
Meera Rao.

01:38:08.316 --> 01:38:09.365
Hello.

01:38:09.445 --> 01:38:10.741
- Hello.
- Meera, sit.

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.077
I am alright, sir.

01:38:12.746 --> 01:38:14.414
I've some shocking news for you.

01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:17.081
It seems like Mr. Hemant Shah

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:20.918
was investing the bank's
money in the stock market all along.

01:38:21.334 --> 01:38:22.330
I know, sir.

01:38:22.932 --> 01:38:26.073
I also know that 565 crores
is missing from NBI.

01:38:26.666 --> 01:38:28.570
- Oh, really?
-Yeah.

01:38:29.048 --> 01:38:30.687
When did you find that out?

01:38:31.391 --> 01:38:32.609
It's a good thing though

01:38:33.171 --> 01:38:34.685
that you found out on your own.

01:38:36.381 --> 01:38:40.367
If you had this information, then
why come here instead of the Police?

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.735
Because Meera,
this case doesn't belong to the Police.

01:38:49.547 --> 01:38:51.312
It belongs to the CBI.

01:38:53.343 --> 01:38:58.153
And the CBI will investigate
when you print it.

01:38:58.591 --> 01:39:01.501
Or you got this information
through some illegal channel

01:39:01.581 --> 01:39:03.281
and you can't go to the Police.

01:39:03.361 --> 01:39:05.632
Meera, the source of
information doesn't matter.

01:39:07.389 --> 01:39:10.515
Our job is to investigate and report it.

01:39:11.379 --> 01:39:14.805
Exactly, sir, if this information
leaks out without thorough investigation

01:39:14.885 --> 01:39:16.851
then the markets will crash.

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:20.141
And we all know
who will benefit from that.

01:39:30.492 --> 01:39:31.800
Sorry.

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:45.630
[Indistinct catter continue]

01:39:49.213 --> 01:39:50.558
What happened, brother?

01:39:52.835 --> 01:39:54.163
Something's not right.

01:39:56.172 --> 01:39:57.522
You know what

01:39:58.623 --> 01:40:02.527
invite the entire
top management over for dinner.

01:40:03.335 --> 01:40:04.674
Why? What happened?

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.801
You said you've an ace up your sleeve.

01:40:07.881 --> 01:40:09.915
Just do as I said.

01:40:11.022 --> 01:40:12.516
Invite everyone to dinner.

01:40:22.276 --> 01:40:24.728
Sir, why are you seeing in the pool?

01:40:25.211 --> 01:40:26.525
Are you looking for hidden treasure?

01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:29.545
What an amazing pool?

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.466
I want to take a plunge
right now...with my clothes on.

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.339
Come on, I'll give you a hand.

01:40:38.419 --> 01:40:41.465
I'll invite you to lunch someday,
and you can swim all you want.

01:40:41.545 --> 01:40:44.922
- Finish your drink for now.
- Great. You're the best boss ever.

01:40:45.002 --> 01:40:45.976
Thank you so much, sir.

01:40:46.056 --> 01:40:48.217
- Guys, it's the boss.
- You're absolutely right.

01:40:50.241 --> 01:40:54.338
Why wait for tomorrow
when you can do it today?

01:40:57.883 --> 01:40:58.662
Come on.

01:41:00.556 --> 01:41:01.888
Take your clothes off.

01:41:03.864 --> 01:41:05.833
- Sir...
- You're really funny, sir.

01:41:06.063 --> 01:41:07.479
- You're really funny.
- You're really funny.

01:41:07.559 --> 01:41:09.919
Why are you all laughing
when I didn't crack a joke?

01:41:21.744 --> 01:41:25.462
Take your clothes off
and get in the pool.

01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:27.300
Now.

01:41:30.465 --> 01:41:32.092
What are you doing?

01:41:34.645 --> 01:41:40.815
One of them is recording
our secrets and leaking them.

01:41:46.422 --> 01:41:47.817
So let's find out...

01:41:49.008 --> 01:41:50.471
Who's wearing a mic.

01:41:55.227 --> 01:41:58.295
Take your clothes off.

01:41:59.092 --> 01:42:00.199
Now!

01:42:50.807 --> 01:42:53.927
Ma'am, NBI has issued a denial.

01:42:54.007 --> 01:42:55.792
-What?
- They claim there's no scam.

01:42:59.994 --> 01:43:01.580
Sir...

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:03.749
Sir, please sir...

01:43:03.829 --> 01:43:05.537
Hear-hear...

01:43:05.617 --> 01:43:08.645
There is no news here
or anything out of place.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.669
No need to panic.

01:43:10.749 --> 01:43:14.293
As the bank said,
it's just a reconciliation problem.

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.961
Everything will be
settled in a few days.

01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:19.163
- Mr. Shah...
- Sir, sir...

01:43:19.243 --> 01:43:20.278
Will it be just this bank

01:43:20.358 --> 01:43:23.661
or should we prepare for a
press conference outside all the banks?

01:43:24.671 --> 01:43:27.212
I am sure all the banks
have asked you for the accounts.

01:43:32.088 --> 01:43:33.406
Sir, sir...

01:43:33.486 --> 01:43:35.806
Sir, sir...

01:43:35.886 --> 01:43:38.618
Sir, sir...

01:43:42.565 --> 01:43:44.959
Ms. Meera... Hemant Shah.

01:43:45.335 --> 01:43:46.841
I wanted to meet you.

01:43:47.469 --> 01:43:48.475
What for?

01:43:49.006 --> 01:43:52.055
Whoever meets me is always in profit.

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:53.986
Note down the address.

01:43:54.992 --> 01:43:57.343
Swarna Bungalow, Madh Marve Road.

01:43:57.423 --> 01:43:59.319
Madh Island? Why so far?

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:01.529
What are you saying, Ms. Meera?

01:44:02.924 --> 01:44:06.940
Your journalist friends go all the way
to Switzerland, Sweden, for a story.

01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:08.995
I am only calling you to Madh Island.

01:44:09.394 --> 01:44:10.832
Come over.

01:44:10.912 --> 01:44:13.493
There's a car waiting for you outside.

01:44:27.087 --> 01:44:29.406
Welcome, Ms. Meera, welcome.

01:44:31.255 --> 01:44:34.369
Welcome to my weekend home.

01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:40.732
Come in. Come in.

01:44:48.857 --> 01:44:50.894
Do you have any interest in sports

01:44:50.974 --> 01:44:55.531
or do you only like
the game of toppling people?

01:44:58.209 --> 01:44:59.880
Why did you call me here?

01:45:06.045 --> 01:45:07.476
To celebrate.

01:45:12.136 --> 01:45:13.124
Cheers!

01:45:18.361 --> 01:45:21.744
You exposed the century's biggest scam.

01:45:23.704 --> 01:45:27.562
Aren't you scared of the consequences
when this scam gets exposed?

01:45:30.828 --> 01:45:32.365
You see, Ms. Meera

01:45:33.439 --> 01:45:35.982
sometimes the newspapers
print the facts.

01:45:39.254 --> 01:45:40.690
Look. Look here.

01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:45.285
Just today,
your newspaper printed an opinion poll.

01:45:47.053 --> 01:45:49.378
64% of people are in my favour.

01:45:49.458 --> 01:45:50.531
64...

01:45:51.885 --> 01:45:55.605
Making money is an art, not a scam.

01:45:57.237 --> 01:45:58.863
That's all I did.

01:46:00.738 --> 01:46:02.504
I'll ask one last time.

01:46:03.711 --> 01:46:05.429
Why did you call me here?

01:46:14.527 --> 01:46:16.336
Who is your informer?

01:46:21.316 --> 01:46:23.898
Who is the traitor, Ms. Meera?

01:46:26.308 --> 01:46:30.005
And don't take Venkateshwar's name.

01:46:31.792 --> 01:46:35.320
I want the name
that led you to Venkateshwar.

01:46:46.526 --> 01:46:47.637
Name.

01:46:50.491 --> 01:46:55.471
You know, for a while even
I was a part of those 64% people.

01:46:57.004 --> 01:46:59.008
But then I found out the truth.

01:47:00.224 --> 01:47:01.610
Fake BR's.

01:47:03.364 --> 01:47:06.568
So stop thinking about the traitor
and find a good lawyer.

01:47:07.728 --> 01:47:09.259
Because they are coming for you.

01:47:14.181 --> 01:47:15.181
Excuse me.

01:47:39.455 --> 01:47:40.288
Hello!

Hemant bhai!

01:47:43.619 --> 01:47:44.752
Yes, Hemant bhai.

01:47:44.832 --> 01:47:46.383
How can I let you speak with them,
Hemant bhai?

01:47:46.463 --> 01:47:49.347
Sir is not around.
In fact, he isn't even in India.

01:47:49.427 --> 01:47:50.767
He's not Hemant sir.

01:47:50.847 --> 01:47:53.506
Okay, fine.
I'll call you as soon as he returns.

- 'NBI Bank and Bank of Satara'
- Open the door.

Hemant Shah scam' - Hari, open the door.

01:48:12.421 --> 01:48:13.962

'The matter will be investigated
by JPC formed by the government.'

Hey, come on...

Come out. Come on...

01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:50.090
Come on, bring him down. Bring him down.

01:48:50.792 --> 01:48:52.569
Hemant sir's call...

01:48:53.331 --> 01:48:54.379
Yes, Hemant bhai.

01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:57.863
Pandey,
how many times do I have to call?

01:48:58.147 --> 01:49:00.444
Last time you said
Sanjeev's gone abroad.

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.004
Now he's not even attending my calls.

01:49:03.384 --> 01:49:05.060
What's going on?
Why isn't he answering my calls?

01:49:05.896 --> 01:49:07.221
He isn't even attending my calls.

01:49:07.688 --> 01:49:08.874
The situation is pretty tense.

01:49:09.385 --> 01:49:11.140
I think he's very busy.

01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.294
I'll tell him to call
you back as soon as he returns.

01:49:15.178 --> 01:49:17.806
God, make my day.

01:49:32.362 --> 01:49:34.503
Please sir, let us go...

01:49:34.583 --> 01:49:37.829
Sir, sir...

01:49:39.897 --> 01:49:42.132
- Get back. Come on.
- Sir, I...

01:49:44.937 --> 01:49:46.265
We will require 1 more box.

01:49:53.665 --> 01:49:54.683
Borkar.

01:49:58.498 --> 01:50:01.203
Mr. Hemant, you must come with us.

01:50:08.806 --> 01:50:10.728
Mom, I'll have to go with them.

01:50:11.635 --> 01:50:16.363
My only mistake was that
I became too rich too soon.

01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:21.489
Don't worry,
I'll come back to you in a week.

01:50:22.405 --> 01:50:23.380
Okay.

01:50:26.167 --> 01:50:27.301
Be careful!

01:50:47.723 --> 01:50:49.206
Come back, Hemant.

01:50:49.671 --> 01:50:51.331
This isn't your punishment alone.

01:50:51.606 --> 01:50:54.809
Until you don't come back, this
house will feel nothing short of jail.

01:50:58.803 --> 01:50:59.900
Come, sir.

01:51:02.471 --> 01:51:04.751
Sir, sir...

01:51:04.831 --> 01:51:07.976
Sir, sir...

Sir, sir...

01:51:10.406 --> 01:51:12.883
- Sir, sir...
- Move, move...

01:51:12.963 --> 01:51:16.779
[Indistinct chatter continue]

01:51:21.821 --> 01:51:24.867
'The Big Bull Hemant Shah
and his brother Viren'

01:51:24.947 --> 01:51:27.651
'were arrested by a CBI team today.'

01:51:28.359 --> 01:51:30.100
'According to sources Hemant Shah'

01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:33.086
'is the mastermind
behind the 5000 crore rupees scam.'

01:51:33.166 --> 01:51:35.247
We're standing outside
the Bombay High Court

01:51:35.327 --> 01:51:37.526
the accused
of the country's biggest scam

01:51:37.606 --> 01:51:39.112
stock market's big bull

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:40.541
Hemant Shah has been sentenced
to 14-days Police custody.

01:51:40.621 --> 01:51:43.528
'The premiere investigatory
agency has determined'

01:51:43.608 --> 01:51:47.036
'that Mr. Shah is responsible
for a 5000 crore rupees scam.'

01:51:47.116 --> 01:51:50.445
Where is all this goverment's
money which you have misused?

01:51:50.525 --> 01:51:52.405
You don't have any option, Mr. Hemant.

01:51:52.485 --> 01:51:55.010
Please, tell us the truth.
Tell us, everything.

01:51:55.568 --> 01:51:58.167
'Who else is involved
in this scam except you?'

01:51:58.247 --> 01:51:59.350
'Staying silent won't help.'

'What connection do you have
with Mr. Venkateshwar?'

01:52:01.015 --> 01:52:02.688
'What deal happened
between you two?'

01:52:02.768 --> 01:52:06.518
This case has shaken
the country's entire banking system.

01:52:34.564 --> 01:52:36.120
'Many bankers have been arrested.'

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.463
'And they have all been
sent like Hemant Shah...'

'He's been given bail,
but the case isn't over yet.'

01:52:45.577 --> 01:52:47.155
'The investigation
is still being conducted.'

01:53:06.949 --> 01:53:09.197
You just got home.
Where are you going now?

01:53:09.548 --> 01:53:10.895
Take some rest.

01:53:13.752 --> 01:53:16.264
I've rested enough for 111 days.

01:53:17.318 --> 01:53:19.150
If I don't take any definitive step

01:53:19.647 --> 01:53:21.186
then these people will bury me alive.

01:53:26.159 --> 01:53:30.265
The worst is behind us. I promise you.

01:53:31.299 --> 01:53:32.259
Hemant!

01:53:33.434 --> 01:53:36.371
This confidence is
what attracted me to you.

01:53:37.772 --> 01:53:40.543
But you must stop now, slow down

01:53:40.891 --> 01:53:42.371
admit your mistake.

01:53:43.798 --> 01:53:45.938
And together
we'll deal with the consequences.

01:53:46.018 --> 01:53:47.828
Why should I admit anything
when I made no mistake?

01:53:49.799 --> 01:53:52.076
80% of our banking system is illegal.

01:53:53.841 --> 01:53:55.621
They are just making me a scapegoat.

01:53:59.964 --> 01:54:01.481
Brother is here.

01:54:02.543 --> 01:54:04.147
Welcome. Welcome back, Hemant.

01:54:05.246 --> 01:54:07.803
Don't worry,
complete strategy is set for the next.

01:54:09.115 --> 01:54:10.597
- Viren.
- Yes, brother.

01:54:11.418 --> 01:54:13.479
Take all the case papers back from him.

01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:14.693
What?

01:54:15.331 --> 01:54:16.305
What did you say?

01:54:17.268 --> 01:54:19.914
I'll stay only a week in jail?

01:54:21.255 --> 01:54:22.146
Come.

01:54:28.945 --> 01:54:32.961
Hari's gone in hiding.
There's no clue of him.

01:54:33.988 --> 01:54:35.568
Even his wife and kids are missing.

01:54:38.391 --> 01:54:41.489
I've learned through a source that
the FM Minister is ready to make a deal.

01:54:47.899 --> 01:54:52.254
After keeping me in jail for 111 days,
I know how their deal's going to be.

01:54:56.726 --> 01:54:59.493
They thought that Hemant Shah is broken.

01:54:59.573 --> 01:55:01.385
Now he can easily bow.

01:55:03.316 --> 01:55:05.672
We still have our ace of cards to throw.

01:55:06.989 --> 01:55:10.230
Using my name to make money
is acceptable to them.

01:55:12.873 --> 01:55:15.900
But not the bad reputation
that comes with it.

01:55:17.783 --> 01:55:19.819
This time the deal will be equal.

01:55:21.063 --> 01:55:22.245
Equal?

01:55:23.396 --> 01:55:24.892
But, where are we going?

01:55:27.701 --> 01:55:29.720
Remember what I said to you.

01:55:30.979 --> 01:55:33.376
If you want to take a risk,
then take a big one.

01:55:37.623 --> 01:55:40.179
If this is the biggest scam till date

01:55:41.144 --> 01:55:43.534
then we need the biggest lawyer too.

01:55:43.954 --> 01:55:45.876
Ashok Mirchandani.

01:55:55.219 --> 01:55:57.303
Mr. Hemant, you made one mistake.

01:55:59.216 --> 01:56:00.930
Anything is possible in this country.

01:56:01.878 --> 01:56:03.625
Use fake promotors.

01:56:04.483 --> 01:56:05.911
Bribe the Police.

01:56:06.328 --> 01:56:09.614
Threaten the Media,
corrupt the Judges. Anything.

01:56:10.315 --> 01:56:11.718
Just one golden rule.

01:56:13.137 --> 01:56:14.544
Never get caught.

01:56:16.949 --> 01:56:18.318
And you, Mr. Hemant got caught.

01:56:21.347 --> 01:56:24.485
Now your best option, in this case,
is what Viren is suggesting.

01:56:25.237 --> 01:56:26.695
Make a deal with the government.

01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:30.123
I will make sure that the
CBI drops most of the charges.

01:56:30.203 --> 01:56:32.604
You'll get a little jail time.

01:56:41.063 --> 01:56:42.988
- Viren.
- Yes, brother.

01:56:44.854 --> 01:56:47.803
Call that Nair up.

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:51.089
Tell him,
we're giving back this case to him.

01:56:52.731 --> 01:56:57.137
I think we made a mistake coming
to Ashok Mirchandani and Associates.

01:57:00.283 --> 01:57:02.688
I thought I had
the biggest ego in this room.

01:57:08.744 --> 01:57:10.504
Mr. Ashok, you should know

01:57:11.732 --> 01:57:13.609
that I made a record while in jail.

01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.097
Within 111 days

01:57:18.618 --> 01:57:20.987
70 different people inquired me.

01:57:22.259 --> 01:57:23.269
Seventy...

01:57:24.816 --> 01:57:26.030
But they found nothing.

01:57:30.562 --> 01:57:34.790
You made your name by
defending people like Mastaan.

01:57:35.991 --> 01:57:37.120
I didn't commit any murder

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.843
but these people want
to make me the scapegoat

01:57:41.608 --> 01:57:43.738
in this 5000 crore scam.

01:57:46.237 --> 01:57:48.408
Whoever bails me out of this case

01:57:49.628 --> 01:57:52.431
will go down in the history of Law.

01:57:59.997 --> 01:58:02.631
I heard there's a similarity
between you and me.

01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:05.930
Whenever we drink

01:58:06.886 --> 01:58:09.239
we drink only the best. Or we don't.

01:58:16.866 --> 01:58:21.062
So logically seeing... we only took
advantage of the system's loopholes.

01:58:22.535 --> 01:58:24.125
I have all this information.

01:58:25.768 --> 01:58:28.757
There's one thing which
is confusing me and the CBI.

01:58:30.483 --> 01:58:35.556
On 2nd November 1992,
you withdrew 52 lakh rupees.

01:58:36.708 --> 01:58:38.251
52 lakh rupees.

01:58:38.881 --> 01:58:41.952
Why did you need so much money suddenly?

01:58:47.184 --> 01:58:51.829
Look Hemant, if you really
want me to go down in history

01:58:52.459 --> 01:58:56.072
then there can be no secrets
between you and me.

01:59:02.872 --> 01:59:04.654
- Viren.
- Yes, brother.

01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:09.309
Remember I told you
I've an ace up my sleeve.

01:59:09.724 --> 01:59:11.652
- Yes.
- Wait a second.

01:59:12.365 --> 01:59:14.117
Ace...

01:59:35.255 --> 01:59:36.966
Are you camera friendly?

01:59:39.329 --> 01:59:41.093
What you just told me

01:59:42.371 --> 01:59:46.254
should be recorded on camera
and played on the television.

01:59:46.999 --> 01:59:50.409
There won't be anything
more sensational than this.

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:55.135
I've a better idea.

01:59:58.529 --> 02:00:01.576
Call reporters and journalists
from every corner of the world.

02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:06.334
BBC, CNN, Times, News Week.

02:00:07.272 --> 02:00:10.166
Let's do a press conference at the Taj.

02:00:11.176 --> 02:00:12.091
Live.

02:00:31.886 --> 02:00:34.143
We must shut Hemant up at any cost.

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.245
Otherwise,
our jobs, life, will be all over.

02:00:37.919 --> 02:00:39.415
These are the Exact words from the top.

02:00:41.201 --> 02:00:42.404
We've only one option then.

02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:44.625
Let's make a settlement
with Mirchandani.

02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:46.662
Because Hemant will never agree.

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.382
Good idea, let's go.

02:01:10.902 --> 02:01:12.203
Mr. Mirchandani.

02:01:12.823 --> 02:01:14.205
Dheeraj, CBI.

02:01:14.957 --> 02:01:16.317
Don't waste my time.

02:01:16.768 --> 02:01:18.238
I can't help you.

02:01:20.733 --> 02:01:22.906
Really? What is this?

02:01:22.986 --> 02:01:26.161
Is this a school?
Am I some kid who'll be scared of you?

02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:29.821
Listen, Mr. Mirchandani.

02:01:31.313 --> 02:01:33.243
No one's trying to scare you,
Mr. Mirchandani.

02:01:34.075 --> 02:01:35.495
We just came here with a request.

02:01:36.111 --> 02:01:38.645
Tell Hemant to stop this charade
while there's still time.

02:01:39.733 --> 02:01:42.790
A compromise is still possible.
Even the Kohlis want this.

02:01:43.691 --> 02:01:45.977
Then tell them to give
a direct offer Hemant.

02:01:46.458 --> 02:01:47.801
He takes his own decision.

02:01:48.069 --> 02:01:49.242
Bravo, Mr. Ashok.

02:01:49.811 --> 02:01:51.306
Spoken like a politician.

02:01:51.621 --> 02:01:53.348
- Excuse me.
- Yes, we know.

02:01:53.428 --> 02:01:56.279
We know you're going to join
the opposition in a few months.

02:01:56.794 --> 02:02:01.129
And this charade is
just an entry fee for them.

02:02:01.486 --> 02:02:02.349
Am I right?

02:02:02.778 --> 02:02:04.368
They only wanted you to bow.

02:02:04.648 --> 02:02:07.079
But you're prepared
to prostrate before them.

02:02:11.164 --> 02:02:12.323
Excuse me.

02:02:15.352 --> 02:02:19.423
Ashok Mirchandani doesn't bow
or prostrate in front of anyone.

02:02:21.610 --> 02:02:24.017
But you did the right thing
by giving me the key.

02:02:25.828 --> 02:02:30.168
Because now I'll take your boss
to the cleaners in the conference room.

02:02:31.318 --> 02:02:32.586
Thank you for that.

02:02:33.062 --> 02:02:34.518
Please. Excuse me.

02:02:44.421 --> 02:02:45.917
Sir, call for you.

02:02:48.592 --> 02:02:50.670
Took you soon enough, Mr. Sanjeev.

02:02:51.587 --> 02:02:54.889
Hemant, what do you think you're doing?

02:02:58.319 --> 02:02:59.594
Have you lost your mind?

02:03:01.696 --> 02:03:03.321
You left me with no option.

02:03:03.597 --> 02:03:05.590
I kept a lot of patience for 15-months.

02:03:05.670 --> 02:03:09.105
Look Hemant,
you can't defeat these people.

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:15.671
If you go ahead with this,
then all the doors will close on you.

02:03:16.253 --> 02:03:17.681
You don't know these people.

02:03:18.275 --> 02:03:20.239
They don't spare their kin, and you...

02:03:21.165 --> 02:03:25.203
Just remember,
anything can happen at any time

02:03:25.283 --> 02:03:28.243
and you won't know what hit you.
Understood?

02:03:28.732 --> 02:03:30.448
They were never open for me anyway.

02:03:32.221 --> 02:03:33.798
Your biggest mistake...

02:03:34.610 --> 02:03:37.972
You thought
that barking dogs seldom bite.

02:03:39.162 --> 02:03:43.409
But Hemant Shah's bite
is worse than his bark.

02:03:44.428 --> 02:03:46.473
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

02:03:46.974 --> 02:03:49.402
Listen, it's not too late.

02:03:49.857 --> 02:03:52.624
Their people are already there.
Give me some time.

02:03:52.704 --> 02:03:54.464
I'll fix something, okay?

02:03:58.133 --> 02:03:59.476
You have three minutes.

02:04:16.065 --> 02:04:19.521
Mr. Hemant...

02:04:19.601 --> 02:04:20.663
Sir, sir...

02:04:20.743 --> 02:04:21.816
Sir, one qestion...

02:04:21.896 --> 02:04:24.576
Settle down. Settle down. Just a minute.

02:04:24.656 --> 02:04:26.409
Listen. Everyone, listen.

02:04:26.489 --> 02:04:29.311
Listen. Sit down, please.

02:04:30.502 --> 02:04:35.766
First, I'll read Hemant's detailed
admission and then give my statement.

02:04:35.846 --> 02:04:38.642
And only after that
will you ask questions.

02:04:38.722 --> 02:04:40.048
Please settle down.

02:05:24.791 --> 02:05:31.421
On November 1st 1991
Mr. Sanjeev Kohli called Mr. Hemant

02:05:31.501 --> 02:05:35.985
and asked if he can arrange
for 1 crore rupees in two days.

02:05:36.065 --> 02:05:37.962
His exact words were

02:05:38.042 --> 02:05:41.220
"This is a lifetime investment
opportunity for you".

02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:44.751
Mr. Hemant started
arranging for the money.

02:05:44.831 --> 02:05:48.820
On 2nd November 1992,
he withdrew 30 lakh rupees

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:51.841
from the National Bank of India
in 100 and 50 denominations.

02:05:52.355 --> 02:05:56.743
Then he withdrew ten lakh from
Forlay's Bank in 50s denominations.

02:05:56.823 --> 02:05:58.941
The proofs are these
withdrawal slips. Please.

02:06:02.230 --> 02:06:03.114
Look here.

02:06:03.857 --> 02:06:05.954
Then Mr. Hemant Shah's company president

02:06:06.034 --> 02:06:09.153
Mr. Srikant arranged for 12 lakh rupees.

02:06:09.233 --> 02:06:12.438
And Mr. Hemant Shah
personally had 15 lakh.

02:06:12.518 --> 02:06:14.503
Total 67 lakh rupees.

02:06:14.583 --> 02:06:18.200
Mr. Hemant Shah
informed Mr. Sanjeev Kohli

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:20.099
that's all he could arrange for.

02:06:20.179 --> 02:06:23.058
Mr. Sanjeev said
that he'll give the rest

02:06:23.138 --> 02:06:24.401
and you can return them later.

02:06:24.481 --> 02:06:27.595
He called Mr. Hemant to Delhi
on 3rd November.

02:06:27.926 --> 02:06:33.348
Mr. Hemant Shah and Mr. Srikant Kumar
put the money in two big bags

02:06:33.428 --> 02:06:37.113
and reached Delhi in the evening
with an Indian Airlines flight

02:06:37.193 --> 02:06:39.850
and checked-in
the New Holiday Inn hotel.

02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:41.503
Here's the proof. Please.

02:06:41.583 --> 02:06:42.632
There.

02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:50.104
Next morning Mr. Sanjeev
sent a Contessa car.

02:06:50.184 --> 02:06:54.435
Mr. Hemant and Mr. Srikant
got in the car with the suitcases.

02:06:54.875 --> 02:06:57.648
But shifted
to Mr. Sanjeev's Honda Accord

02:06:57.728 --> 02:07:00.575
before reaching the destination

02:07:00.655 --> 02:07:04.554
and put Mr. Sanjeev's
33 lakh in their suitcases.

02:07:05.138 --> 02:07:07.926
Now they had exactly 1crore rupees.

02:07:09.026 --> 02:07:11.379
Then they headed for the destination.

02:07:11.873 --> 02:07:13.323
The destination was...

02:07:14.486 --> 02:07:16.637
7 Race Course Road

02:07:16.717 --> 02:07:20.848
and the investment opportunity
was The Prime Minister of India.

02:07:25.323 --> 02:07:28.172
That's right.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

02:07:28.828 --> 02:07:30.725
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Listen to me.

02:07:30.805 --> 02:07:32.355
I said you all...

02:07:32.435 --> 02:07:33.586
Normally...

02:07:33.666 --> 02:07:36.232
Normally whenever there's a scam

02:07:36.312 --> 02:07:39.184
we don't address
it by the person's name.

02:07:40.122 --> 02:07:43.120
We call it the Cement Scam, Coal Scam,
that's how we call them.

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.892
If you want to give this scam a name,
then let me tell you

02:07:46.972 --> 02:07:49.182
this is not the Hemant Shah scam.

02:07:49.675 --> 02:07:51.920
It's the Prime Minister Scam.

02:07:54.018 --> 02:07:56.045
- SIr...
- Tell me something...

02:07:56.125 --> 02:07:59.496
Tell me, something...

02:07:59.576 --> 02:08:03.427
He knew what Hemant was doing,
and yet he kept quiet.

02:08:03.918 --> 02:08:05.962
He didn't do anything. Why?

02:08:06.659 --> 02:08:08.147
What's the meaning of this?

02:08:08.898 --> 02:08:10.249
It's all too clear.

02:08:10.329 --> 02:08:14.935
He kept quiet because
even he is a part of this scam.

02:08:15.015 --> 02:08:17.429
That is all. Thank you.

02:08:17.925 --> 02:08:19.458
- But sir, such a huge allegation.
- Sir...

02:08:19.538 --> 02:08:21.012
What is the source behind it?

02:08:21.092 --> 02:08:25.014
This is just an allegation, and I can
refute this allegation in a minute.

02:08:25.094 --> 02:08:26.288
I see.

02:08:27.511 --> 02:08:28.405
How?

02:08:28.485 --> 02:08:33.180
Because Mr. Hemant, you said
that the money which was withdrawn

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.548
was mostly 50s and 100s denomination.

02:08:35.628 --> 02:08:39.652
And how can you fit
1 crore rupees in two suitcases?

02:08:39.732 --> 02:08:40.783
- Tell me.
- Tell me, sir.

02:08:40.863 --> 02:08:42.515
- Tell me, Mr. Hemant.
- Tell me, sir.

02:08:42.595 --> 02:08:43.914
Tell me.

02:08:45.252 --> 02:08:46.328
Tell me, sir.

02:09:03.314 --> 02:09:04.616
Do you want to check?

02:09:05.025 --> 02:09:06.869
Check if it's 1 crore or not.

02:09:07.166 --> 02:09:09.040
I can count it for you if you want.

02:09:12.246 --> 02:09:13.189
Do you see it now?

02:09:14.584 --> 02:09:15.629
Are you happy?

02:09:17.854 --> 02:09:18.970
Can I speak now?

02:09:24.663 --> 02:09:27.479
You say that I did
a scam of 5000 crores.

02:09:29.243 --> 02:09:30.345
First of all.

02:09:32.692 --> 02:09:33.949
What scam?

02:09:34.928 --> 02:09:36.442
Whose money did I take?

02:09:37.013 --> 02:09:41.393
Yours, your... or your money.

02:09:48.672 --> 02:09:50.504
Do you even know what a scam is?

02:09:53.837 --> 02:09:56.558
I gave a tip to a lift
man to buy shares of tyres.

02:09:56.638 --> 02:09:58.293
Today he owns a car.

02:09:59.842 --> 02:10:02.059
One day I bought peanuts at the signal.

02:10:02.139 --> 02:10:04.065
Next day the rates of peanuts went up.

02:10:04.406 --> 02:10:05.646
Is that a scam as well?

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.269
Yes.

02:10:12.496 --> 02:10:15.250
I made a fortune in the stock market.

02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:17.797
Did I do anything wrong?

02:10:19.356 --> 02:10:20.747
Is it wrong to make money?

02:10:25.332 --> 02:10:26.585
Not just you

02:10:27.271 --> 02:10:30.798
but the entire country
made money because of me.

02:10:32.657 --> 02:10:34.917
But you won't accept this fact today.

02:10:35.458 --> 02:10:40.557
20-years-later you'll realise
what I did for you and the country.

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:44.121
I am not the problem, ma'am

02:10:45.024 --> 02:10:47.191
the problem is our political system.

02:10:48.328 --> 02:10:50.427
Our politicians do scams.

02:10:52.068 --> 02:10:54.607
They don't want to see
anyone else getting rich.

02:10:54.899 --> 02:10:57.282
Today they are forming
new laws to trap me

02:10:57.362 --> 02:11:00.068
because they know
I haven't broken any law.

02:11:03.608 --> 02:11:06.322
They are experts
in making false promises.

02:11:08.755 --> 02:11:12.001
They are the ones who bury your dreams.

02:11:13.649 --> 02:11:17.086
I taught middle-class India to dream.

02:11:20.177 --> 02:11:24.671
I am a broker of those dreams
and not the stock market.

02:11:31.412 --> 02:11:33.135
5000 crore, I'll tell you.

02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:37.411
If I had it,
I would've given it all back.

02:11:38.532 --> 02:11:39.594
Do you know why?

02:11:41.071 --> 02:11:48.152
Because I am and will
always be the only Big Bull!

02:11:50.224 --> 02:11:51.694
You can write whatever you like.

02:11:51.996 --> 02:11:54.193
Hemant sir, please one more question.
Sir, please one more question.

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:56.259
- Sir, one more question.
- Thank you for coming.

02:11:56.339 --> 02:11:58.399
Sir, sir...

02:11:58.479 --> 02:12:01.092
Sir, sir...

02:12:17.281 --> 02:12:19.210
'The Prime Minister
is yet to comment...'

02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:21.467
'Blame is on Prime Minister.'

02:12:21.547 --> 02:12:23.560
'Bribe amount is Rs. 1 crore.'

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:25.229
'There has been
a huge drop in the market.'

02:12:25.309 --> 02:12:26.708
'People suffered a huge loss.'

02:12:26.788 --> 02:12:29.016
'The Prime Minister has denied
Hemant Shah's accusation.'

02:12:29.096 --> 02:12:30.452
- Hemant Shah!
- Down. Down.

02:12:30.532 --> 02:12:31.971
- Hemant Shah!
- Down. Down.

02:12:32.051 --> 02:12:33.651
- Hemant Shah!
- Down. Down.

02:12:33.731 --> 02:12:37.704
Until that doesn't happen,
the PM should resign.

02:12:37.784 --> 02:12:40.494
Not at all. Hemant Shah is lying.

02:12:41.972 --> 02:12:47.017
He just wants to escape going
to jail for 5000 crore scam that he did.

02:12:47.264 --> 02:12:48.131
Wait a second.

02:13:10.769 --> 02:13:13.243
You can never prove your case to JPC.

02:13:15.167 --> 02:13:18.108
They are miles ahead, and...

02:13:18.188 --> 02:13:19.870
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:21.999
Is this why
you called me here at this hour?

02:13:23.921 --> 02:13:25.413
What you saw the other day
was just part of the evidence.

02:13:25.493 --> 02:13:26.969
We have much more.

02:13:27.049 --> 02:13:28.532
You're not listening, Viren.

02:13:29.319 --> 02:13:31.994
Your claims don't match
with the Police records.

02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:34.157
According to the PM's itinerary

02:13:34.237 --> 02:13:37.164
he wasn't at his residence
on that day and time.

02:13:38.612 --> 02:13:41.682
There is no record in the visitor's
logbook of your brother's visit.

02:13:43.429 --> 02:13:45.161
Your plane tickets, hotel stay

02:13:45.241 --> 02:13:47.256
the entire money trail
will be proven bogus.

02:13:47.621 --> 02:13:50.281
You know, what all this will mean.

02:13:51.572 --> 02:13:55.203
It means that it's your word
against the Prime Minister.

02:13:55.935 --> 02:13:57.338
And who will the people believe?

02:13:58.023 --> 02:14:00.224
The Prime Minister or two scamsters?

02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:05.330
I told you before the press conference,
don't do it.

02:14:05.666 --> 02:14:08.879
But no.
Your brother had to satisfy his ego.

02:14:09.921 --> 02:14:12.398
But now you must
convince him to step back.

02:14:13.197 --> 02:14:15.242
I don't know how you can do it, but...

02:14:19.162 --> 02:14:20.437
Convince him.

02:14:21.087 --> 02:14:23.710
Convince him to step back. Me?

02:14:26.106 --> 02:14:27.866
And who is responsible for all of this?

02:14:28.823 --> 02:14:30.693
Hemant Shah
is the richest man in the country.

02:14:31.185 --> 02:14:32.079
The highest taxpayer.

02:14:32.159 --> 02:14:34.487
They will arrest you
under the narcotic's case, Viren.

02:14:35.864 --> 02:14:36.719
What?

02:14:36.799 --> 02:14:39.021
When or how don't even ask.

02:14:39.541 --> 02:14:40.786
But they will do it.

02:14:42.962 --> 02:14:45.781
Trust me, my sources are never wrong.
And you know it.

02:14:46.607 --> 02:14:48.855
But we've no connection with narcotics.

02:14:49.137 --> 02:14:50.522
What are you saying, Meera?

02:14:50.602 --> 02:14:54.005
You should know how powerful
people in our country

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:57.955
manipulate the system
for their own advantage.

02:14:59.156 --> 02:15:00.400
You're out on bail now.

02:15:00.955 --> 02:15:03.063
But there's no bail
in the narcotic's case.

02:15:04.997 --> 02:15:10.072
If you keep up this charade, then
I guarantee you that you'll go to jail.

02:15:11.473 --> 02:15:13.390
And for a long time.

02:15:19.981 --> 02:15:22.986
By the way, our scores are not settled.

02:15:41.863 --> 02:15:44.149
- Is brother still awake?
- Yes, he's inside.

02:15:51.734 --> 02:15:55.956
Listen,
JPC doesn't believe our evidence.

02:15:56.279 --> 02:15:59.170
Forget JPC. They are going
to arrest us for narcotics.

02:15:59.582 --> 02:16:00.743
Narcotics?

02:16:00.823 --> 02:16:02.025
The news is confirmed.

02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:04.052
What are you saying?

02:16:04.132 --> 02:16:07.090
I don't want to go to jail again,
for narcotics or the stock market.

02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:09.406
Please handle this.
I won't go to jail again.

02:16:09.486 --> 02:16:11.228
What's wrong?

02:16:11.555 --> 02:16:14.092
You promised you'll handle everything.

02:16:15.421 --> 02:16:17.788
I don't want to go to jail.
I don't want to go to jail.

02:16:18.689 --> 02:16:23.092
I wanted a normal life
as we had in Kalbadevi.

02:16:23.172 --> 02:16:26.253
We used to be small time brokers
and a small office. Do you remember?

02:16:27.404 --> 02:16:28.985
We were so happy with little money.

02:16:30.570 --> 02:16:33.308
I warned you to tread slowly,
tread slowly.

02:16:33.388 --> 02:16:34.677
Don't fly too high, don't...

02:16:34.757 --> 02:16:36.138
First,
you said you're doing itfor Priya.

02:16:36.218 --> 02:16:37.321
Then you said you're
doing it for the company.

02:16:37.401 --> 02:16:38.730
Then you said you're
doing it for the family.

02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:40.290
Then you said you're
doing it for the country!

02:16:40.736 --> 02:16:42.644
You were actually doing it for yourself!

02:16:44.229 --> 02:16:46.154
Why didn't you listen to me?

02:16:47.527 --> 02:16:48.886
I told you that Meera
let go off with a warning

02:16:48.966 --> 02:16:50.297
but she wrote an entire article.

02:16:58.099 --> 02:16:59.253
What did you say?

02:17:02.174 --> 02:17:03.160
Meera, what?

02:17:27.351 --> 02:17:28.258
You?

02:17:31.091 --> 02:17:32.794
A small leak sinks a great ship.

02:17:34.267 --> 02:17:35.716
But I don't want to sink the ship.

02:17:39.149 --> 02:17:41.233
I want to curb his limits from growing.

02:17:43.675 --> 02:17:45.524
I want to tell you the truth.

02:17:47.517 --> 02:17:49.308
I sent that girl on the train.

02:17:50.051 --> 02:17:53.505
But then I realised maybe Venkateshwar
won't tell you the entire truth.

02:17:54.717 --> 02:17:56.061
That's why I am here.

02:18:02.695 --> 02:18:04.391
No one can stop my brother.

02:18:06.333 --> 02:18:08.395
He's reached the country's treasury.

02:18:09.413 --> 02:18:11.581
He wants to be a billionaire
as soon as he can.

02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:13.462
And he can do anything for it.

02:18:14.851 --> 02:18:16.538
Doesn't make a difference to anyone.

02:18:17.268 --> 02:18:19.334
No one can see what he's doing.

02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:23.831
Maybe no one wants to see because their
pockets are filled, except for you.

02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.349
You're the only person
who is not on his payroll.

02:18:36.434 --> 02:18:37.891
That's why I came to you.

02:18:46.699 --> 02:18:49.352
I had no intention
of sending you to jail.

02:18:51.235 --> 02:18:55.039
I only wanted to slow you down a little.

02:18:56.355 --> 02:18:59.369
You were issuing cheques
worth 5-6 billion.

02:19:00.692 --> 02:19:04.221
I thought
that you're not breaking any law.

02:19:04.659 --> 02:19:08.531
Maybe you'll be fined,
or be suspended for a couple of months.

02:19:10.219 --> 02:19:13.144
I didn't know it will come to this.

02:19:16.191 --> 02:19:18.337
I ruined everything.

02:19:37.537 --> 02:19:38.986
You'll be fine.

02:19:42.688 --> 02:19:44.205
I'll fix everything.

02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:49.362
I won't let anything happen to you.

02:20:07.592 --> 02:20:08.979
You don't look surprised.

02:20:11.475 --> 02:20:12.798
You don't look worried.

02:20:15.517 --> 02:20:17.804
What's the point of
looking worried anymore?

02:20:20.077 --> 02:20:26.767
Ms. Meera, you've done many
breaking stories on me and earned fame.

02:20:27.716 --> 02:20:30.222
But we had a partnership, didn't we?

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:35.089
Your source was from my own family,
my own brother.

02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:39.645
I settled that account with Viren.

02:20:41.188 --> 02:20:44.518
I gave him information
in exchange for information.

02:20:48.819 --> 02:20:50.357
Then those books are closed.

02:20:51.841 --> 02:20:53.018
Let's open new ones.

02:20:54.336 --> 02:20:55.221
Which ones?

02:20:58.103 --> 02:21:00.114
I want you to write my story.

02:21:00.968 --> 02:21:03.585
But not small articles
like you did earlier.

02:21:03.930 --> 02:21:06.120
This time I want you
to write an entire book.

02:21:09.206 --> 02:21:10.889
Because Ms. Meera

02:21:13.855 --> 02:21:17.973
nothing happens
because of one man alone.

02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:22.292
Stories are born out of circumstances

02:21:23.062 --> 02:21:24.524
and not character.

02:21:29.893 --> 02:21:32.683
If we had better laws,
and a better system

02:21:33.953 --> 02:21:35.917
then I would've
never taken advantage of it.

02:21:37.072 --> 02:21:38.160
That's not true.

02:21:38.530 --> 02:21:40.277
If given a chance again

02:21:40.651 --> 02:21:43.465
you'll find new loopholes
and take advantage, Hemant.

02:21:44.770 --> 02:21:45.688
No.

02:21:46.913 --> 02:21:47.916
Not today.

02:21:49.016 --> 02:21:51.456
Because India doesn't need it anymore.

02:21:53.451 --> 02:21:58.515
If you take me back to 1988 again,
then definitely.

02:21:59.284 --> 02:22:01.677
I'll do it all over again.

02:22:03.977 --> 02:22:10.028
And why do you think I'll write
a book on a selfish man like you?

02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:12.349
Selfish?

02:22:17.861 --> 02:22:19.531
Ms. Meera,
let me tell you another story.

02:22:22.833 --> 02:22:27.459
One day I went to Apollo Bunder instead
of Worli Seaface for my morning walk.

02:22:27.539 --> 02:22:28.538
Just like that.

02:22:29.031 --> 02:22:30.472
Do you know what happened the next day?

02:22:30.816 --> 02:22:33.439
The share prices of Apollo tyre went up.

02:22:36.185 --> 02:22:39.276
I've made many such good mistakes,
Ms. Meera.

02:22:42.001 --> 02:22:44.844
And the common man
made a little fortune.

02:22:47.241 --> 02:22:49.193
Some other accidental tip.

02:22:50.761 --> 02:22:53.152
So, I can invest my money as well.

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:57.765
No tips for free.

02:22:58.792 --> 02:23:00.989
For that you need money.

02:23:04.653 --> 02:23:06.226
Write this book, Ms. Meera

02:23:07.484 --> 02:23:08.861
it will be a best-seller.

02:23:12.318 --> 02:23:14.103
That's Hemant's Shah's prediction.

02:23:15.562 --> 02:23:17.394
And it's never wrong.

02:23:23.933 --> 02:23:27.665
'Hemant couldn't prove
his allegations to the JPC.'

02:23:28.039 --> 02:23:29.802
'PM gets a clean chit.'

02:23:33.781 --> 02:23:37.445
'Hemant Shah has quit the stock market
and assured he'll never return.

02:23:38.359 --> 02:23:40.778
'He's taken
full responsibility of the scam'

02:23:40.858 --> 02:23:43.075
'and Viren Shah has been acquitted.'

02:23:43.733 --> 02:23:47.586
'Around 27 cases are pending
against Hemant Shah.'

02:24:26.885 --> 02:24:28.147
Five years.

02:24:31.637 --> 02:24:34.996
1825 days without me.

02:24:37.987 --> 02:24:39.115
You're going to have a ball.

02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:42.576
Why do you feel that way?

02:24:48.612 --> 02:24:51.640
My feelings don't count anymore.

02:24:55.883 --> 02:25:00.967
I never felt that Viren
will make such a mistake.

02:25:03.351 --> 02:25:04.996
And I never felt that...

02:25:09.244 --> 02:25:11.953
Hari will betray me
and become an approver.

02:25:18.053 --> 02:25:24.821
I don't know what Viren
and Hari did was right or wrong.

02:25:26.211 --> 02:25:32.625
I don't know what the government
did was right or wrong.

02:25:35.533 --> 02:25:37.284
But I do know

02:25:38.721 --> 02:25:44.637
that what you said to me
in Hanging Garden, you did it.

02:25:48.662 --> 02:25:51.309
Today there are many buildings in Mumbai

02:25:51.953 --> 02:25:54.355
have scaled heights because of you.

02:25:59.405 --> 02:26:06.870
You gave new hope to the people,
to see a new world.

02:26:09.505 --> 02:26:11.916
And they will never come out of it.

02:26:18.468 --> 02:26:19.575
Forget about the people

02:26:22.982 --> 02:26:24.846
you just wanted a husband
who owned an apartment, a car

02:26:24.926 --> 02:26:30.272
and a stable job. And look at this now.

02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:31.943
Hemant...

02:26:34.694 --> 02:26:42.129
Most of the people in this world
have their destiny written.

02:26:43.782 --> 02:26:46.869
But only few write their own destiny.

02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:50.397
You're one of them.

02:26:58.172 --> 02:27:02.275
You can fulfill those dreams
when you come back.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:18.923
Let's go, sir.

02:27:37.665 --> 02:27:41.575
Next day I heard that
he died of a heart attack.

02:27:43.718 --> 02:27:45.448
Was it a conspiracy?

02:27:46.425 --> 02:27:50.716
Was it political motivated conspiracy
by some people to hide something?

02:27:52.451 --> 02:27:55.573
Was it the biggest cover-up
of this country?

02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.739
Maybe yes, maybe not.

02:28:37.865 --> 02:28:42.142
The truth is Hemant Shah's
life was a big controversy.

02:28:44.556 --> 02:28:46.208
But 2020...

02:28:47.245 --> 02:28:48.584
This world is very different.

02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:53.383
Our country is in the hands
of professional MBAs like you.

02:28:54.896 --> 02:28:57.570
And it's more for relief
if I'm being honest.

02:29:06.842 --> 02:29:10.541
But before I go, I want to say
that it wasn't always like this.

02:29:11.753 --> 02:29:14.998
30-years-ago, our country
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

02:29:16.316 --> 02:29:21.993
And 25-years-ago Hemant Shah
reminded me of this in an auditorium.

02:29:23.859 --> 02:29:26.623
I know you believe
he's a scamster. But...

02:29:27.439 --> 02:29:28.956
He wasn't a scamster on that day.

02:29:30.248 --> 02:29:31.392
He was the hero for the people.

02:29:32.649 --> 02:29:36.219
For the people sitting there,
and those waiting outside for him.

02:29:36.555 --> 02:29:37.733
Excuse me, ma'am.

02:29:39.058 --> 02:29:40.142
What about you?

02:29:40.431 --> 02:29:41.987
Was he a hero for you too?

02:29:45.085 --> 02:29:48.765
Even 5-years after independence,
development was nil.

02:29:49.272 --> 02:29:50.566
That was a crime.

02:29:52.144 --> 02:29:54.591
What Hemant Shah did was also a crime.

02:29:55.731 --> 02:30:00.693
And as strange as it may sound,
maybe we needed a crime like this.

02:30:00.773 --> 02:30:02.560
To emerge from that crime.

02:30:03.351 --> 02:30:05.814
And Hemant was the perfect candidate.

02:30:07.664 --> 02:30:09.651
If he was a little less egoistic

02:30:10.177 --> 02:30:11.881
if he knew how to tread slow

02:30:12.966 --> 02:30:14.605
then he could've survived
for a longer time.

02:30:15.949 --> 02:30:17.233
But he was a dreamer.

02:30:17.313 --> 02:30:22.000
So it's important to tell his story,
which I did today.

02:30:23.079 --> 02:30:25.222
The face which lit up on the screen

02:30:26.422 --> 02:30:28.534
whether it belongs
to a hero or a villain

02:30:29.074 --> 02:30:32.665
you can make your assumptions
by reading my book.

02:30:34.965 --> 02:30:36.836
But there are no two opinions
about one thing...

02:30:38.302 --> 02:30:43.384
He was and always will be...
the only Big Bull.

02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:23.007
"My beloved's like a prayer of hope,
maybe that's how God is..."

02:31:23.418 --> 02:31:34.003
"You're like drops of water,
giving me fresh breath of air..."

02:31:34.894 --> 02:31:44.446
"My beloved's like a prayer of hope,
maybe that's how God is..."

02:31:45.252 --> 02:31:55.619
"You're like drops of water,
giving me fresh breath of air..."

02:31:57.855 --> 02:32:08.831
"On the verge of love my heart believes,
this is a relation of generations..."

02:32:09.390 --> 02:32:14.862
"In a city of turmoil..."

02:32:14.942 --> 02:32:20.308
"You're the one I believe in..."

02:32:20.388 --> 02:32:25.689
"With you life feels worth living..."

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:31.212
"Without you there's no living..."

02:32:31.292 --> 02:32:36.367
"Without you there's no living..."

02:32:59.245 --> 02:33:09.053
"My beloved's like a prayer of hope,
maybe that's how God is..."

02:33:09.783 --> 02:33:20.379
"You're like drops of water,
giving me fresh breath of air..."
