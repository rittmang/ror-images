WEBVTT

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.124
"You dwell in my heart."

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:49.624
"Whether its dusk or dawn."

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:52.624
"Whether in light or darkness."

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:55.457
"You're always with me."

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.249
It was my mother's dying wish..

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.915
..to take the entire 'Bhajan Mandli'
group along with their family..

00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.165
..on a trip to Badrinath.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.207
Please do come.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:11.332
Of course.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.374
Please join us on the trip..

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:16.832
..and pray for my mother's soul.

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:28.665
Why do souls become
restless after they die?

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.040
I mean, once you're dead
it's the end of all problems.

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.207
Why become restless?

00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:34.665
That's not it.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:40.249
Suppose the deceased
has a unfulfilled wish.

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:42.207
Then his son will fulfil it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.374
You won't go on the trip.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:47.874
Get that.

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:50.540
Her mother was in the
hospital for two years.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.207
And he didn't even
come take a look.

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:54.540
He was making dollars in America.

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:57.540
This charade is for the world.

00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:00.207
Not for his mother's soul.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.999
No need to look so depressed..

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.540
..you won't get an off.

00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:05.707
Get that.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.665
Just one idol left!

00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:19.249
By the way,
where's the trip headed?

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.290
I can't believe
you're coming with us.

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:31.999
The children are so happy.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.249
She thinks I'm going
for beholding the Lord.

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:40.249
"Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare."

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.749
"Hare Rama; Hare Krishna"

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:47.540
"Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare."

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:54.915
Where is he?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.957
A dozen of pot-bellied Ganesh idols.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.665
What!

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.749
And those 250 a peice Krishnas.

00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:08.332
Eight of those brawny Hanumans.

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:11.124
What are you saying?
- And five of those 'Sherawali'.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:12.207
The lady sitting on the tiger.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:14.915
What's the total?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.790
Three dozen, sir.
- Three dozen, right!

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:19.499
Then, three Sai Babas bonus.
- What?

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:21.290
They are in a big demand.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:24.207
Send it to the white
Volvo parked there. - Okay.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.540
Great, wine shop.

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:49.749
"Hare Rama; Hare Krishna."

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:51.374
What did you give him?

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:53.290
Give me too.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.624
Funny people, they're distributing
alcohol like holy water.

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.290
What's that?

00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:06.915
What should l say?

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.457
Water of Ganges.
- Yes, yes.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:09.707
Oh, give me some.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:15.957
Why is it so bitter?

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.582
Because the Ganges is polluted.

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:19.040
Oh!
- Yes.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.124
"Hare Rama; Hare Krishna."

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.957
"Krishna;
Krishna; Hare; Hare." - Mother.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.374
"Hare Rama; Hare Krishna."

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:38.999
"Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare."

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.165
Apologise. They were fasting.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.124
Hello.
- We were fasting.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:49.624
And you gave us alcohol.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.499
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.

00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:53.749
It's made from sugarcane.

00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:59.207
It fills you with energy,
and makes you lightheaded.

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:02.624
Rascal. Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.957
Abusing in the month
of 'Shravan' (pious month).

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:09.040
See. Truth sounds
bitter than liquor.

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:10.624
There's a limit to cracking jokes.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.749
Papa, please.

00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.957
What you did yesterday,
is a sin in mummy's view.

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:17.999
And mummy's fasting
today to repent for it.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.749
I want to know.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.040
How can she repent
for my sins by fasting?

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:27.665
Sushila, it's like
your phone's on charging..

00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:29.290
..and my battery's getting charged.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:30.874
Like wi-fi?

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.165
Chintu, careful.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.249
Papa.

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:37.082
Get down.

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.165
Papa, we're practising.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:40.915
Today's 'Janmastami'.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.499
You've your exams tomorrow.

00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:43.999
Who will write that?

00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:45.665
Get down!

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.665
Why do you always stop
for religious things?

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:49.540
He'll be absolutely fine.

00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:51.582
My son's playing Govinda.

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:54.790
My son won't become
Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.

00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.624
He'll grow up to
become a cricketer.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:07:58.915
Get down. Get down.

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:00.249
Put me down.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.999
Mahadev.
- Coming.

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.249
Let's go.
- Come soon.

00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:11.874
Listen. Remove the
tag of Rs.250 from..

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.290
..all the new idols that we bought

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.082
Just watch how l sell
them for 10-12 thousand.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.332
And keep one idol
from each on display.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:24.249
Understand?
- Yes.

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:26.624
Come on.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.832
One and only one
piece in the world.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.415
This idol appeared
from the ground..

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.249
..when the temple at
Badrinath was being built.

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:39.999
What are you saying?

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:43.874
A great sage from Dwarka
set out for a journey on foot..

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:46.790
..and that afternoon
the sun was really scorching..

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.582
..I gave him a jug
of water to drink.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.207
He was so pleased.

00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.790
And gave me this idol.

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:57.915
And this idol turned
my luck around.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.415
I bought this, once a rented shop..

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.124
..and a three room
house in Bhooleshwar.

00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:06.707
With terrace.

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:07.832
Amazing!

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:10.832
Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me.

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:14.707
I am in big trouble.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:18.624
I'll rot in hell if I
even think of selling my Lord.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.249
Sell the Lord?
Look at what he's saying.

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:23.207
Mischievous... Lord.

00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:25.915
Listen carefully.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.707
You can hear His flute.

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.832
It's time for him
to play His flute.

00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.207
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.

00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.165
Listen. you can hear
the echo of Gokul.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.332
Heard it?

00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:46.374
Can you hear?
- Yes, yes.

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:48.749
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.957
Please, Mr. Kanji.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.124
I'll let this idol
out of my sight..

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:53.999
..only when that
special person arrives.

00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:55.415
The chosen one.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.707
Who is that?

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:00.999
The sage had said that
"A great devotee of Sai..

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:05.040
"..from Rajasthan
will come for His Idol".

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:07.290
That's amazing.
- What?

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:09.457
That's me.
- No, no.

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.790
Look, there's my car.

00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:12.040
RJ, Rajasthan.

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:15.499
And it also has
an 'Om Sai' sticker.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:16.874
That's true.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.415
What did you say your name was?

00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:20.957
Bhanwar Lal.
- Bhanwar Lal?

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.707
Mahadev...it's him?

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.624
Who?
- It's him?

00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.249
What happened? - The sage
had written your name himself.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:31.499
Look.

00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:32.957
Bhanwar Lal.

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:36.249
I don't understand
a word that's written here.

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:37.624
It's written in Madrasi.

00:10:37.916 --> 00:10:40.749
He was a Madrasi. Though
he lived in Dwarka but, look..

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:42.832
Great.

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:44.665
This idol now belongs to you.

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:46.374
Thank you.

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.665
Great.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.540
Kanji Money?
- Bhanwar Lal.

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.457
You only listen,
but don't understand.

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.999
I said l won't charge
you for this idol..

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:56.374
..but I will have to pay the sage.

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:57.957
Yes, of course.

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:01.749
Here you go. 100 rupees.

00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:04.874
Only 100..
- Mahadev. Mahadev.

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:07.790
This is a question of devotion.
We cannot force anyone.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.540
Do you how much I had at that time?

00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:11.874
Only 20 rupees.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.207
Only 20 rupees. Remember?

00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.332
So do you know what I did?

00:11:14.416 --> 00:11:18.374
I was wearing a similar gold chain.
And l gave that to him.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.457
It's all about faith.

00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:23.374
Anything you give is less.

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:25.124
Wow. What a thought.

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:28.832
Not just my gold chain,
I will give up my gold ring too.

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:30.624
That's it.

00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:32.207
Here. Here you go.
- Great, great. Discard your burden.

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.915
Discard all your burden.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.290
Great, great.

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:39.540
Glory to..
- Lord Krishna!

00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:41.540
Glory.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.874
Now, where will
this idol emerge from?

00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.665
From the holy land of Mathura,
where else?

00:11:46.166 --> 00:11:49.790
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.665
Glory to you.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.165
As long as people believe
in toys like this..

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.832
..our business will prosper.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:12:00.374
Kanji. This is the God's idol,
don't call it a toy.

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:04.624
The Lord is only a delusion.
- Yes, let's go.

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:11.624
Isn't that Chintu?

00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.165
Yes.

00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:15.707
Yes, that's him.
- Yes.

00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:19.332
Yes. He's dancing so well.
Serpent dance.

00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:21.332
I'll put an end to all this.

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.999
Shut down the shop
and get the scooter. - Yes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.374
Come on. Kanji.
- Yes.

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:29.082
Look after my shop for a month.

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.540
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.457
I suggest that you
get your shop fixed..

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:33.749
..rather than going on a Haj.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:34.957
God save me from devils.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.624
Your shop will come crashing
down even if anyone sneezes.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.249
Let's go.
- Coming.

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:48.999
Give them seeds worth rs.10.
- Okay.

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.749
Come on, start it quickly.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.374
Glory to..
- Siddeshwar Maharaj.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.457
Let the 'Janmastami'
festivities begin.

00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:32.290
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:35.874
"You're so striking."

00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.707
"lf you're fire, I am water."

00:13:37.791 --> 00:13:40.457
"lf you're the sky,
we're the stars."

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:43.124
"You're so striking."

00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.999
"lf you're fire, I am water."

00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:48.082
"lf you're the sky,
we're the stars."

00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.707
"Even if we've to
lay down our lives."

00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:52.540
"But we promise."

00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:55.415
"We won't let you go."

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.249
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:10.457
"Go...go...go...Govinda"

00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:14.082
"You're so striking."

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:15.874
"lf you're fire, I am water."

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.999
"lf you're the sky,
we're the stars."

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.332
"You're so striking."

00:14:21.416 --> 00:14:23.165
"lf you're fire, I am water."

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.499
"lf you're the sky,
we're the stars."

00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:28.874
"Even if we've to
lay down our lives."

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.707
"But we promise."

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:34.540
"We won't let you go."

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:48.582
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:52.207
"1 1, 12, 13. The heat's rising."

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:54.040
"ln my body."

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:55.749
"1 1, 12, 13..."

00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.499
"1 1, 12, 13. The heat's rising."

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:01.332
"ln my body."

00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:02.249
"Don't look now."

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.999
"My eyes are spitting fire."

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:08.582
"This sight looks so colourful."

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.249
"You're so talked about,
you're so unique."

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.290
"Even if we've to
lay down our lives."

00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:16.124
"But we promise."

00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:19.249
"We won't let you go."

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:26.832
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:37.707
Just one more place left to visit.

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:40.124
Mishra.

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:42.707
You call me from Kashi for a day..

00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:44.457
..and make me travel
the entire day.

00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:47.332
It's a small area.

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:49.457
Once you give them your blessings..

00:15:49.541 --> 00:15:51.249
..they'll cast their votes for me.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.832
Glory to..
- Siddeshwar Maharaj.

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:05.374
"What's this fervour?"
"What's this obsession?"

00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:07.249
"What's this craze?"

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.082
"What's this fervour?"

00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:10.915
"Tell me. Tell me."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.707
"What's this fervour?"
"What's this obsession?"

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.415
"What's this craze?"

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:18.165
"What's this passion all around?"

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.915
"We'll lose ourselves in yourjoy."

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:25.332
"We'll lose ourselves
in your devotion."

00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.499
"Even if we've to
lay down our lives."

00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:29.082
"But we promise."

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.332
"We won't let you go."

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:39.999
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.499
Look, Sonakshi Sinha.

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:45.415
She is Rowdy,
my Rathore's in the next alley.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.540
Let's go. Come on.
- Yes.

00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:52.874
"Break the pot."

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:04.707
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.082
Begin with the festivities.

00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:29.707
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:32.707
What's going on here. Move.

00:17:34.625 --> 00:17:35.624
Get down.

00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:40.749
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:43.707
Come here.
- Yes, yes.

00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:52.874
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.124
break it. Break it.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.957
Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.707
Calm down! Calm down!

00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.207
It's the Swami's orders.

00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:02.290
Calm down!

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:04.290
Calm down! Calm down!

00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:06.207
What orders?

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:10.999
Sri Siddeshwar Maharaj
has just said..

00:18:11.666 --> 00:18:15.165
..that Lord Krishna
is very pleased..

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:17.707
..to see the crowd
that has gathered around..

00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.582
..for the 'Janmastami' festivities.

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:24.624
And today He'll eat milk
and butter from His devotees.

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:27.874
Yes, he'll drink
milk and eat butter.

00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:30.040
And Siddeshwar Maharaj
also says that..

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:33.624
..this auspicious opportunity
will last only for an hour.

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:35.374
Only one hour.

00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:38.165
So, your time begins now.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.207
Go. Go.
- Who is that imposter?

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:42.374
Hello, hello, hello.

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:43.749
Play. Play.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.915
Go ahead, feed Him.
- What's wrong with the mic?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.790
See what's wrong?

00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:50.124
What's wrong with the mic?
- Where's everyone going?

00:18:50.208 --> 00:18:51.499
Go, go.
- No, wait.

00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:54.499
Where are you going?
- Go.

00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:58.957
Play, play harder.
- Wait everyone, wait.

00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:02.707
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj
is asking you to go.

00:19:04.041 --> 00:19:06.457
Go, leave.
- Wait.

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.749
What have you done?

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:11.290
No, papa. No. - Stupid fool,
breaking pots during your exams.

00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:13.874
Stop it, stop it.

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:15.749
Go and feed Him butter.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.999
I won't spare you next time.

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:22.290
Stop you fool!

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.249
You'll be punished
for your unpardonable sin.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.624
He will punish you Himself.

00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:31.832
Punish me?

00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:35.707
Don't try to scare
me in the name of Lord.

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:38.832
I'll see what He does to me.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.457
Go home, it's going to rain.

00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:45.749
You'll get drenched.

00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:52.124
It's an earthquake.

00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.082
Swamiji Rain?

00:19:55.708 --> 00:19:56.707
Rain?

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.040
My hand's paining.

00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:05.540
I won't be able to
write my exam tomorrow.

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:06.707
I'll slap you.

00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:08.874
I'll make you hold the pen
in your mouth and write your paper.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.165
You're scolding him.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.374
But what about you?
- What did I do?

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:14.540
What?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.040
The festivities
were left incomplete.

00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:18.665
You've to admit that there's God.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.915
You spread the rumour..

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.290
..and immediately
there was an earthquake.

00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.124
Remember.
- What earthquake?

00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:25.415
Even the utensils didn't budge.

00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:27.540
Papa.

00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:30.999
I think they took your
announcement too seriously.

00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:34.999
This news just came in
from parts of the country..

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:38.874
..that the idol of Sri
Krishna's eating butter.

00:20:39.125 --> 00:20:40.790
Is the Lord eating butter?
- No.

00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.957
Priest, offer the
Lord some buttermilk.

00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:47.624
People are offering cheese,
cottage-cheese..

00:20:47.708 --> 00:20:50.040
..butter, buttermilk to
the idol of Krishna. - Oh, God!

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.999
The rumour has spread so far.

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:53.707
Please, eat it.

00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:55.874
This is low-cholesterol cheese.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.874
The Lord's so lucky.

00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:00.832
Look at the things He's getting.

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:02.790
Earlier, people would
keep it in a covered platter..

00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:03.874
..in front of Him.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.749
But now they're feeding Him.

00:21:06.458 --> 00:21:07.457
Let Him enjoy.

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:09.040
It's your fault.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.624
Mumbai just experienced
a slight earthquake tremor..

00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:16.249
..of 3.5 Richter scale,
which didn't cause..

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:18.624
..any harm to life or property.

00:21:18.708 --> 00:21:20.082
See. Heard that?

00:21:20.833 --> 00:21:23.749
But a shop in the flea
market has collapsed..

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:25.207
..which was closed at that time.

00:21:25.583 --> 00:21:27.999
Must be Mohammad's shop.

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.874
According to our sources..

00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:33.665
..the shop was registered to Mr.
Kanji Lalji Mehta.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.165
It's really surprising, because..

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:45.499
..there are other old shops in
this market which are still intact.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.582
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop
has been completely destroyed.

00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:53.749
This is Shweta Tiwari, with
cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.707
Sister, switch on ABP News quickly.

00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:57.957
We saw.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.749
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
It's collapsed.

00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:02.124
Pravin!
- Calm down, father.

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:04.415
No, sister.
Come there with the children.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.707
I'm coming there with
father and the others. - Yes.

00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:07.749
Yes, we're coming.

00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:08.832
We're coming.

00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:14.999
The idols of Gods
have gone underneath.

00:22:27.416 --> 00:22:28.915
The shop is completely ruined

00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:31.707
Doesn't seem like there
was ever a shop here.

00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:33.165
What are you saying?

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:35.415
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.

00:22:35.583 --> 00:22:38.040
And we'll have to
pay the scrap dealer..

00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:39.582
..to have this cleared.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.790
Why pay?

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.040
We'll give him one
of the broken idols..

00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:45.290
..and say "It appeared
from the ground in Amarnath".

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:47.249
What are you saying,
brother-in-law?

00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:49.040
You'll soon be bankrupt.

00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.290
Do you know the losses
you've incurred?

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:52.790
40 lakhs.

00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:54.915
Goods worth 25 lakhs
bought on credit..

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.999
..and 15 lakhs spent
on renovation last month.

00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:00.082
40 lakhs? Where did
you get that kind of money?

00:23:00.458 --> 00:23:04.832
We borrowed a part of the
amount by mortgaging the house.

00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:09.707
And l borrowed 10
lakhs from a friend.

00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:11.665
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket..

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.665
..for earning 18% interest.

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:15.249
Pravin, you fool.

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:16.832
You didn't even ask me.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.957
How will we arrange
for such a huge sum?

00:23:22.166 --> 00:23:24.540
There's hardly 30-40
thousand in the bank.

00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:27.415
And we don't even have jewellery.

00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:31.999
Sushila. We'll manage.
- How?

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.332
Why don't you understand?

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.665
If you hadn't spoken
ill about the Lord..

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.540
..He wouldn't have
caused this earthquake.

00:23:40.916 --> 00:23:43.999
His justice is silent.

00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:46.290
Will you please stop preaching?

00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:49.832
You mean to say, that the Lord..

00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:53.332
..who doesn't exist,
razed down my shop..

00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:55.040
..because I spoke ill about Him?

00:23:56.583 --> 00:24:00.040
So, just to prove Himself..

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:03.749
..he razed down just
my shop in a fit of rage.

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:06.207
And if I still don't
believe in Him..

00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:09.124
..he will make me
incur more losses? - Yes.

00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:10.249
What yes?

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.040
I still don't believe in You?

00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:19.207
I haven't incurred any loss.

00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:24.332
Look.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.957
What's he doing?
- What..

00:24:30.458 --> 00:24:32.249
Everything's lost, Kanji.

00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:35.165
Only thing left
is this Godrej safe.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:01.665
Rolex.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.249
It's a Rolex.
- No.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.457
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that
a Rolex watch you're wearing?

00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:14.665
Must be worth 1 .5 -2 lakhs.

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:16.249
It's worth 10.

00:25:18.708 --> 00:25:19.707
Mr. Kanji.

00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:22.665
I am sure you read
the terms and conditions..

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.332
..before reading the policy.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.207
Not at all, sir.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:29.957
Your officer asked me
to sign at the places marked..

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.290
..and I did so.

00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:32.874
How irresponsible you are.

00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:34.915
What happened, sir?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.665
Your policy insures you against..

00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:42.040
..accidents like theft,
fire, fraud.

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:44.040
Right. That's what we opted for.

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.957
But not against Act of God.

00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:47.499
Act of God?

00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:51.124
See, it's written here clearly.

00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.290
Conditions apply.

00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:55.749
My glasses.. - In the event
of loss or damage to the property..

00:25:56.416 --> 00:25:59.665
..the insurance company
is not liable to pay..

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:05.457
..any amount if the damage
is caused by act of God.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.165
And here are your signatures.

00:26:09.833 --> 00:26:12.332
It's written in such small letters.

00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:14.082
And nobody reads that.

00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:16.415
What is 'Act of God'?

00:26:16.833 --> 00:26:19.540
Incidents that are
not caused by humans.

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:24.040
Like? - Like earthquake,
Tsunami, Thunder.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:27.457
You cannot claim
insurance in such cases.

00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:29.374
Because these are
natural calamities.

00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:30.874
But I don't believe in God.

00:26:30.958 --> 00:26:31.957
Tell him.

00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:34.582
I don't care if you do or don't.

00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:36.749
You're signatures are right here.

00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:38.415
I am so sorry.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.124
Sorry? What sorry?

00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:42.499
Sir.

00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:44.749
Sir, I've invested my
entire earnings in the shop.

00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:46.082
Even my house is mortgaged.

00:26:46.166 --> 00:26:47.082
And you're saying sorry.

00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:49.749
I know, but your claim
cannot be approved.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.624
You may go now.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.790
No, sir. I won't leave
until my claim isn't approved.

00:27:01.083 --> 00:27:02.082
Security.

00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:05.374
Sir..
Sir, why are you calling security?

00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:08.082
I'm talking to you decently.
- Yes, sir.

00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:09.790
Take him away, please.
- Why call the security..

00:27:09.875 --> 00:27:11.540
Come on.
- Just a minute.

00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:12.790
Just a minute.

00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:13.790
Come on.

00:27:13.875 --> 00:27:15.624
You just know how
to swindle our money.

00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:16.832
Mind your language.

00:27:16.916 --> 00:27:18.999
You should be publicly beaten.

00:27:19.041 --> 00:27:20.207
Throw him out.

00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:21.457
Get out! Get out!

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:27.082
You get this for
2000 in the flea market.

00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:30.999
Don't you understand?

00:27:31.041 --> 00:27:32.207
It's Act of God.

00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:35.207
You want money, don't you?
Go and ask God. Take him away.

00:27:35.291 --> 00:27:36.290
Act of God.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.582
Just a second. Just a second.

00:27:40.666 --> 00:27:41.665
Leave me.

00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:43.957
Act of God.

00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:46.957
So, you believe in God.
- Yes.

00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:50.665
You believe that God
is present everywhere.

00:27:51.041 --> 00:27:54.165
In him, him, that madam, him.

00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:56.040
God dwells in everyone.
- Yes.

00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:57.124
And me?

00:27:57.666 --> 00:28:00.040
Mr. Dinesh, you believe
that God dwells in me too.

00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:02.457
Yes.

00:28:02.541 --> 00:28:03.540
Thank you.

00:28:03.666 --> 00:28:05.124
Act of God. I didn't do it.

00:28:05.208 --> 00:28:06.374
God did. It's 'Act of God'.

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:09.707
God slapped him again.
I didn't do it.

00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:16.124
And now God will shoot you..
And you will die.

00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:18.249
Later, will your
family get the claim..

00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:19.999
..or will that be
'Act of God' as well?

00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:21.915
Tell me.
- No.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.082
Kanji, what are you doing?

00:28:23.166 --> 00:28:24.957
Why are you scared? Take the gun.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.082
Get down now, come on.

00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:51.624
The phone's ringing again.

00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:53.082
Forget it.

00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.415
You switched of your mobile..

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.457
..that's why they're
calling on the landline now.

00:28:57.583 --> 00:28:59.457
Tell them I am not at home.

00:29:00.666 --> 00:29:02.915
They say if we don't
arrange for the money..

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.374
..we'll have to vacate
the house in a month.

00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:11.457
I had so many dreams.

00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:14.415
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.

00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:16.290
And my son a cricketer.

00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:20.624
But soon I'll even lose this house.

00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:24.540
Everything's lost.

00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:28.874
Everything will be fine.

00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:30.957
What will be fine?

00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:34.082
All l have is the shop property.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.749
I'll sell that and
repay the mortgage.

00:29:38.916 --> 00:29:42.957
"Om Jai Jagdish Hare."

00:29:43.208 --> 00:29:45.332
"Swami.."

00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:48.374
Yes. Yes, he's here.

00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:50.915
It's Nimish.
- Who?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.332
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.

00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:55.332
Oh yes.

00:29:56.875 --> 00:29:59.582
Yes, Nimish. Go ahead.

00:30:01.916 --> 00:30:03.665
Did you find a buyer
for that property?

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:10.499
What are you saying?

00:30:10.583 --> 00:30:12.915
What happened?

00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:17.624
He's saying, there are broken
idols of God on that land..

00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:19.165
..so it's become inauspicious.

00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:22.207
The place has become cursed.
- Oh, God!

00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:23.999
No one will buy this land..

00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.874
..that's the rumour in the market.

00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:30.415
Nimish. 100 years later,
when people find..

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.790
..idols of God under that land, the
prices will shoot up by 4 times.

00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.124
Four times.

00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:39.207
And people will construct
a temple there as well.

00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:40.957
If anyone wants the
buy the land he can..

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.124
..otherwise I care a damn.

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:44.499
What now?

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.540
I've an idea.

00:30:57.875 --> 00:30:59.165
What are you doing, Kanji?

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.332
Suicide!

00:31:00.416 --> 00:31:02.082
Sister-in-law, suicide..

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:03.999
Papa.
- Where?

00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:05.374
Leave me.

00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:06.999
What are you doing?
- Papa..

00:31:07.041 --> 00:31:08.415
I am not a coward.

00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:13.332
I will file a case.

00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:16.457
Have you lost it?

00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:19.374
He's gone crazy.

00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:23.124
You will file a case
against an insurance company..

00:31:23.208 --> 00:31:24.374
..worth 3000 crores!

00:31:24.666 --> 00:31:27.124
I'm sure there are
many others like you..

00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:28.999
..who have filed a case
against the insurance company.

00:31:29.458 --> 00:31:32.957
There must be others like
me who might have filed a case..

00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:37.874
..but no ever filed
a case against your Kishen.

00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:45.832
I...will...file a
case against your God.

00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:47.040
What are you doing?

00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:52.999
"Who controls this world?"

00:31:54.291 --> 00:32:00.207
"Who's that sitting
high up in the sky?"

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:08.624
"Why are You hiding
behind the clouds?"

00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:14.165
"Why are You afraid of being seen?"

00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.624
Kanji.
- Yes.

00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:17.165
How will you fight the case?

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.290
That's simple.

00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:21.040
If your Lord can
appear in the temple..

00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:24.874
..from 9-12 and 4-7,
then he's free from 12-4.

00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:26.874
He can appear in
the court at that time.

00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:30.540
What do you need? Tell me.

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:32.082
Agreement,
affidavit, anything you need.

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:33.749
I will make it. Come with me.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.999
One minute.
- I've high contacts.

00:32:38.083 --> 00:32:39.790
Just tell me what you need?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.415
High contacts?
- Yes.

00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:43.374
I want to send a notice.
- Come with me.

00:32:44.791 --> 00:32:45.790
Come on.

00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:49.582
So, who do you want
to serve the notice to?

00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:51.707
'Bhagwan' (God).

00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:54.957
So, Mr. Bhagwan

00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:59.207
Surname?

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:01.874
He must have a last name?

00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:05.207
Sharma, Verma,
Kapoor, Khanna, Desai, anything.

00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:07.290
Don't know, because we haven't met.

00:33:07.916 --> 00:33:08.915
I see.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.915
No.
- You two haven't met?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.082
No.
- That's fine.

00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:15.915
What's his crime? Crime.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.207
He has ruined me.

00:33:17.291 --> 00:33:20.415
What? You just said
you two haven't met.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.290
This Mr.Bhagwan
must live somewhere.

00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:24.415
Resident?
- Who do I send the notice too?

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.290
People say that
He lives in temples.

00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:27.457
I see...

00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.290
What?

00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:32.957
Which 'Bhagwan' are
you talking about? - Sit.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.040
He has many names,
which ones should I say?

00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:37.999
Krishna,
Ram, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.874
Sai Baba.
- It's a sin.

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.665
Hanumanji. Balaji...

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.874
And ladies too.

00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:45.999
Durga, Saraswati,
Parvati, Santoshi.

00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:47.415
You've lost your mind!

00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:49.040
Wasting my time.

00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:50.624
Get lost. Come on.

00:33:51.583 --> 00:33:52.665
Mad man.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.582
The nerve he has. Come on.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.624
Don't trouble me.

00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:01.082
Leave me alone.

00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:02.832
Go to someone else.

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:03.999
I plead you.

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:07.874
Wait a minute, I'm a Hindu.

00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:12.540
"Hari Bol."
"Speak now, reveal the secrets."

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.540
The person we're going
to see now is a famed lawyer.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.290
If he says yes,
ourjob will be done.

00:34:19.541 --> 00:34:21.165
Yes, sir. Which floor?

00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:22.874
Lift's out of order?

00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:24.165
1 1th floor.

00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:26.874
I forgot the key to the scooter.
I'll be right back.

00:34:26.958 --> 00:34:28.124
Come on.

00:34:29.583 --> 00:34:33.207
"He's witty, sells lies."

00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:36.957
"Kanji's cleverness
is known everywhere."

00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:47.999
"He's witty, sells lies."

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:51.624
"Kanji's cleverness
is known everywhere."

00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:53.540
"He locked horns with God."

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:55.415
"And invited trouble for himself."

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.207
"He always speaks the truth."

00:34:57.291 --> 00:34:58.665
"His honesty is unique."

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.124
Mr. Lawyer.
- Yes.

00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:08.374
Religious.

00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.374
Kanji. - Go back,
we're at the wrong place.

00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:15.874
Are you with him?

00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:24.374
Stop, stop.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.999
Excuse me, where does
advocate Hanif Qureshi live?

00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:30.457
Up ahead.

00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:39.249
Is Hanif at home?
- Yes.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.082
Come. Father's inside.

00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:45.165
Hello.

00:35:54.166 --> 00:35:55.624
You seem to be in trouble.

00:35:57.291 --> 00:36:02.207
In the last riots,
I defended some innocent Hindus.

00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:06.790
And my own people did this to me.

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:09.624
Father cannot walk.

00:36:12.958 --> 00:36:15.290
But you want to fight..

00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:18.165
..with the One who created
your entire community.

00:36:21.083 --> 00:36:22.332
Will you flee?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.415
I've no other option left.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.082
I won't run.

00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:31.082
Look, l cannot fight your
case in this condition..

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.124
..but if the lawyers
refuse to take up your case..

00:36:37.458 --> 00:36:40.124
..then according to the law
you can defend your own case.

00:36:40.208 --> 00:36:42.749
Is that possible?
- Yes, there's a provision in the law.

00:36:45.125 --> 00:36:47.999
If you want I can
prepare your legal notice.

00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:50.124
I'll be grateful to you, Hanif.

00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.457
Thank you.

00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:57.457
Hanif. Do you believe in Allah?

00:36:58.291 --> 00:36:59.457
Of course.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.332
God, Allah, they are all the same.

00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:05.874
So, I am fighting against Him.

00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:08.040
So, why are you helping me?

00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:10.915
You're not the only pleader.

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:12.874
Everyone does.

00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:16.582
Some pleads to Him,
and some against Him.

00:37:20.125 --> 00:37:21.582
Where do you want
to send this notice?

00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:26.624
I don't have his...
Address.

00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:28.582
No.
- Then.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.665
The judge will dismiss your
case in the first hearing.

00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.790
I mean, I don't have His address..

00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:37.665
..but of the places
where people look for Him.

00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:43.207
"You're our benefactor,
our friend."

00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:44.957
"So scare us."

00:37:45.083 --> 00:37:48.582
"Why ruin our present, by telling
us about an unknown future."

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.999
"You're our benefactor,
our friend."

00:37:58.041 --> 00:37:59.790
"So scare us."

00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:03.124
"Why ruin our present, by telling
us about an unknown future."

00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:05.249
"Your saints and sages,
spread shams in Your name."

00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:07.165
"They put a price tag on you."

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:11.082
"What's money got
to do in devotion?"

00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:18.040
"Hari Bol."

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.957
"Speak now, reveal the secrets."

00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:22.165
"Speak up."

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.540
"Hari Bol."

00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.457
Hello. Relax, just relax.

00:38:29.916 --> 00:38:31.124
The shop in flea market..

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.999
..which collapsed a few days
ago due to the earthquake..

00:38:33.083 --> 00:38:34.915
..the owner of that shop,
Kanji Lalji Mehta..

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.332
..has filed a case against God.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.165
This is the reaction of
people over the matter.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.999
Down with..
- Kanji!

00:38:41.083 --> 00:38:42.249
Just relax.

00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:45.082
This case won't be
accepted in the court.

00:38:45.333 --> 00:38:46.332
Trust me.

00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:48.040
Just leave it to me.

00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:51.082
You won't even have
to come to the court.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.999
Relax.

00:39:04.083 --> 00:39:20.749
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:22.082
Greetings.

00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:26.124
I feel we should
meet that person once..

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.540
..and listen to his problems,
and try to understand.

00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.540
Well, I..

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:49.124
Although we all hold
different positions..

00:39:49.208 --> 00:39:50.665
..in different communities.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.665
But our God is one.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.749
Later.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.040
And today, a human
has accused our God.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.124
This is not a personal war.

00:40:06.625 --> 00:40:08.374
Instead, it's a
battle for all humans..

00:40:08.458 --> 00:40:10.874
..who have faith in God.

00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:15.374
So l've decided that l,
Siddeshwar Maharaj..

00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:18.415
..and Gopi Maiyya,
will go to the court..

00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:24.207
..to give that shameless
human a fitting reply.

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.415
Down with..
- Kanji!

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.874
Yes, it's a democracy, where
everyone is treated equally.

00:40:33.125 --> 00:40:34.582
And now, even God.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.707
Even God will have to stand in
the High Court's witness box..

00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:39.874
..where the most dangerous
criminals stand for trial.

00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:41.457
Strange, but true.

00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:44.415
I still say, think about it once.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.290
I already have.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.874
Today's the first hearing..

00:40:49.958 --> 00:40:51.499
..and the judge
will decide whether..

00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:53.790
..such a case can
be accepted or not.

00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.207
It's a good omen.

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:14.165
Really nice. Let's go.

00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:22.665
Many believers are standing outside
the court shouting slogans against Kanji.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:31.499
Down with..
- Kanji!

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.999
Many 'dharma gurus'
have come to the court..

00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:36.999
..to give a reply of
Kanji's baseless allegations.

00:41:37.083 --> 00:41:39.999
Very few people have been
allowed in the courtroom as well.

00:41:40.458 --> 00:41:41.790
Swami, give me your blessings.

00:41:43.458 --> 00:41:45.624
Move aside, no one
will touch the swami.

00:41:45.708 --> 00:41:47.040
Move aside, move aside.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:59.874
Down with..
- Kanji!

00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:03.457
Kanji, people say you're
doing this for publicity?

00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:08.999
Down with..
- Kanji!

00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:17.040
You?
- You will sit here.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.749
Sit, sit.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.249
Hey insurance..

00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:27.874
How's the Rolex?

00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:29.499
Working fine.

00:42:29.583 --> 00:42:34.832
Relax.

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:37.999
He's the one who spread
the rumour about God eating butter.

00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:45.707
All rise.

00:42:48.958 --> 00:42:50.124
Kanji, get up.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.832
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
- Yes, sir.

00:43:12.458 --> 00:43:15.874
We've been informed that
you'll defend your own case.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.249
Yes..

00:43:18.416 --> 00:43:20.499
I don't have any other option,
Your Honour.

00:43:21.708 --> 00:43:23.082
The other lawyers are scared.

00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:25.999
So, I'll have to defend this case..

00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:27.457
My lordship, this is
a baseless appeal.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.540
A publicity stunt.

00:43:30.166 --> 00:43:32.499
There's no cause of action
that can be proved in court.

00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:37.540
So l suggest, under
order 7 rule no.1 1 ..

00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:39.207
..of the code of civil procedure.

00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:41.790
This case be
straightaway dismissed..

00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:43.457
..for out of cause action.

00:43:45.791 --> 00:43:48.749
Your Honour,
my English isn't that good..

00:43:48.833 --> 00:43:51.790
..but I do
understand that he's asking..

00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:53.665
..to shut down this
case immediately.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.207
Right? You're right.

00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:58.040
I don't want to get into
this hassle in the first place.

00:43:58.291 --> 00:44:00.082
I'm a Gujarati, businessman.

00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:03.374
Whether the Lord exists or not,
doesn't make a difference to me.

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:05.040
The insurance people said that..

00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.790
..God has razed down my shop.

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:09.165
Or, he's the One behind
your shop's destruction.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.374
So, I said fine. Ask God
to compensate for my losses.

00:44:11.458 --> 00:44:12.374
Case closed.

00:44:12.458 --> 00:44:14.290
But why will God
raze down your shop?

00:44:16.666 --> 00:44:17.582
Fool!

00:44:17.666 --> 00:44:18.665
Please.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.665
Please come to the
witness box and speak.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:37.165
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

00:44:37.666 --> 00:44:39.499
Why will God raze down my shop?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.415
Exactly, why will
God raze down my shop?

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.415
He has other important
things to do.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.665
So, tell the
insurance company to pay me.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.332
End of matter.

00:44:51.416 --> 00:44:53.249
Why will the
insurance company pay you?

00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:55.374
You've agreed to the
terms and conditions..

00:44:55.458 --> 00:44:56.624
..of the insurance company.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.957
Exhibit no.1, sir.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.540
Right. Then God will
have to compensate for it.

00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.124
Call upon,
Lord Ram, Shiva, Ganpati..

00:45:03.208 --> 00:45:05.207
..Whoever you get
along better with.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.540
Do some of your hocus-pocus, or..
- Fool!

00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:12.832
The only way to find
God is through salvation.

00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:16.165
God won't descend down on earth..

00:45:16.541 --> 00:45:18.124
..for a ordinary man like you.

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:21.082
He would only if He exists.

00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:26.957
You're turnover is in millions,
and this is a small settlement.

00:45:27.166 --> 00:45:27.999
Just say yes.

00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:31.165
I will even give you
cash discount. Really.

00:45:33.791 --> 00:45:34.999
I object, Your Honour.

00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:40.665
Mr. Kanji is calling
service to God a business.

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:44.040
Of course it's business.

00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:46.540
Take a visit to
any religious place.

00:45:46.625 --> 00:45:48.249
First you've to pay for parking.

00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:51.415
Then, pay for standing
in the smaller queue.

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:54.499
Then pay for the flowers,
blanket, candle.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.999
And the donation box is
kept right before the idol.

00:45:57.083 --> 00:45:59.040
As soon as you bow down,
you've to put something in it.

00:45:59.125 --> 00:46:02.165
And they even charge
for the offerings of God.

00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:06.707
Just like we're charged for
seeing wax statues in the museum.

00:46:06.791 --> 00:46:10.249
Similarly, they charge us for
seeing the stone idols in temples.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.249
And the priests
have salaries as well.

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:14.832
His is less, and his is more.

00:46:14.916 --> 00:46:16.874
And you even have
income tax benefits.

00:46:17.083 --> 00:46:18.457
Right?

00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:20.457
So, where's the service?

00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:24.457
And, Your Honour, there's never
recession in this business.

00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:25.332
No.

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:27.665
In fact, they do better
business during recession.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.665
"Oh, God! Oh my, God!"

00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:31.124
Relax.

00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:33.124
Consider that it is a business.

00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:34.999
Still, why are you
asking them for compensation?

00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:37.165
You pay premiums
for your insurance..

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.832
..so you can ask
them for a compensation.

00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:40.582
But why will the temple pay you?

00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:45.332
Because...l've paid premiums
in their temples as well. - What?

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.707
What nonsense?

00:46:47.416 --> 00:46:50.040
I knew you won't believe me..

00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:53.540
..so I have brought
all the proofs along.

00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:56.874
Look. These are the
receipts of the premium..

00:46:56.958 --> 00:46:59.249
..I've been paying
for the last 18 years.

00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:01.332
On my wife's advice.

00:47:01.625 --> 00:47:02.624
Look

00:47:02.708 --> 00:47:05.374
My first premium
was for 1501 rupees..

00:47:05.875 --> 00:47:09.165
There's a well-known temple
in the South. l paid it there.

00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:13.665
Then, l've been paying
1000 rupees every year..

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:15.374
..at Lord Ganesha's stall.

00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:17.540
It's called a mandap.

00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:22.415
And, your honour, my mother-in-law
used to be very sick.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.249
So, the temple
authorities said, "Pay us 1 1,000.."

00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:28.415
"..perform a veneration
and watch the miracle".

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.040
We performed the veneration
and my mother-in-law passed away.

00:47:32.166 --> 00:47:34.457
That was a good thing,
but I also lost 1 1,000.

00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:37.332
And they didn't
refund a single rupee.

00:47:38.583 --> 00:47:40.665
And then, donation at the mosque..

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.915
..blanket at the shrine,
candle at church, alms for beggar..

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.290
..incense sticks,
veil for Mother Goddess.

00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:50.457
In total l've paid around 10
lakhs in all these stores.

00:47:50.541 --> 00:47:53.457
Enough!

00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:57.499
Don't call it a store.

00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:59.582
It's called a temple.

00:48:01.125 --> 00:48:04.082
And people donate
willingly at the temple..

00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:07.207
..for the peace and
prosperity of their family.

00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:09.207
Even I gave this amount..

00:48:09.291 --> 00:48:11.540
..for the peace and
prosperity of my family.

00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:13.749
And not for fun.

00:48:14.416 --> 00:48:17.040
But your God snatched
all the peace from my life.

00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:19.124
Because only God can
cause earthquakes.

00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:21.040
Humans cannot do it.

00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:24.165
So tell me, don't I've a right
to ask God for compensation?

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.290
Mr. Kanji.

00:48:25.833 --> 00:48:27.457
You've a tiff with God, don't you?
- Yes.

00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:29.290
So why don't you ask Him
directly for compensation?

00:48:29.416 --> 00:48:30.582
Why are you asking the temples?

00:48:32.125 --> 00:48:37.082
Which company supplies
electricity to your home?

00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:39.207
Reliance.
- Reliance.

00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:41.707
So if there's an
electricity problem in your home..

00:48:41.791 --> 00:48:43.999
..you will call up the
Reliance office, won't you?

00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:46.207
You won't call
Anil Ambani directly.

00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:50.540
Mr. Anil,
we've a electricity problem.

00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:53.124
Silence.

00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:56.749
What do you mean?

00:48:57.166 --> 00:49:02.249
These priests, the saints
are officers of God. - No.

00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:03.999
They aren't officers.

00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:06.124
Officers are educated people.

00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:08.957
They are...

00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:11.165
They are salesmen, Your Honour.

00:49:13.208 --> 00:49:14.915
They are collection agents..

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.790
..because they own God's franchise.

00:49:16.875 --> 00:49:18.207
Your Honour.

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.082
This man's an atheist.

00:49:25.041 --> 00:49:29.249
He doesn't know what he's saying.

00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:33.540
But, we are saints.

00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:35.665
We will forgive him.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.415
But the world will never
forgive him for this grave sin.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.874
You won't be able to set
foot out of your house..

00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:47.207
..if you say anything else.

00:49:47.541 --> 00:49:50.999
Is that your concern for me..

00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:53.374
..or are you threatening
me in front of the judge?

00:49:55.416 --> 00:49:58.290
We...are concerned for you.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.540
They pay me up quickly.
End this matter.

00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:02.540
My lord, this is enough.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.624
The donation receipts,
the submissions.

00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:07.707
There's no agency agreement
between God and my clients.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.457
Kanji is saying baseless things.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.207
We cannot file a case
against God for such a small thing.

00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:15.290
Small?

00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:18.374
My lord, this isn't small issue.

00:50:18.833 --> 00:50:20.415
That shop means everything to me.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.165
My means of earning.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.082
The only way to support my family.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.624
And l built that
shop with hard work.

00:50:29.208 --> 00:50:31.582
Now, it's just a piece of land.

00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:33.999
And no one's ready
to buy that as well.

00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:37.665
These people say,
"Donate with faith.."

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.499
"..and you'll never be wronged".

00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:43.124
And the insurance people say
"Pay your premiums on time.."

00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:44.999
"..we're there in
your troubled times".

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:48.082
I gave donations and
also paid my premiums.

00:50:48.416 --> 00:50:50.332
But none of them are
willing to help me.

00:50:51.083 --> 00:50:52.749
I am an ordinary human.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.457
A middle-class man.

00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:55.999
My family, my wife and children..

00:50:56.041 --> 00:50:57.499
..will be forced
to live on streets.

00:50:58.125 --> 00:50:59.249
No, my lord.

00:50:59.458 --> 00:51:02.707
You'll have to give me a chance
to defend my case in this court.

00:51:03.166 --> 00:51:06.124
And the constituency of
India gives me the right..

00:51:06.208 --> 00:51:08.124
..to voice my plea in this court.

00:51:09.125 --> 00:51:10.582
So please, my lord.

00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:25.582
One crore is a big amount
for a middle-class businessman.

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:29.582
And especially, when it's
a question of his survival.

00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:37.082
So, the court accepts
Kanji Lalji Mehta's case.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:44.749
Silence.

00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:49.124
And only after
carefully examining..

00:51:49.833 --> 00:51:51.457
..all the evidences and arguments..

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.165
..the court will give
its verdict, whether..

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.499
..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will
get his compensation or not.

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:59.124
And if he does,
then who will pay him?

00:51:59.958 --> 00:52:03.040
The insurance company or,
the temple.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.332
The court's adjourned for the day.

00:52:13.291 --> 00:52:14.790
Wait. Wait.

00:52:16.291 --> 00:52:19.999
You can perform all
the veneration you want..

00:52:20.333 --> 00:52:22.957
..and ring those bells
as many times you wish.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.832
Your God razed down my shop.

00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:32.540
And now, I will alone
shut down all his shops..

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:35.540
..or my name isn't
Kanji Lalji Mehta.

00:52:36.083 --> 00:52:39.582
And this isn't my concern for you.

00:52:40.041 --> 00:52:42.207
It's a direct warning.

00:52:42.708 --> 00:52:43.957
Yes.

00:53:27.041 --> 00:53:32.124
You're safe here,
it's a government property.

00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:35.040
But how will you escape them?

00:53:45.083 --> 00:53:57.415
Down with..
- Kanji!

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.874
Sir. The case has been accepted.

00:54:00.958 --> 00:54:02.624
I'm worried about
Sushila and the children.

00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:03.874
I'll take a cab, you go.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.624
But how can l leave you alone.

00:54:05.708 --> 00:54:07.915
I'm going to the police station,
for protection.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.415
Drop her home as well. Go.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.957
Be careful, dear.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.790
Go, go, go.

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.915
Are the boys ready?

00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:19.540
Remember.

00:54:20.458 --> 00:54:23.374
Kanji shouldn't get
to see daylight. That's it.

00:54:26.291 --> 00:54:27.707
There he is.

00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:57.290
Catch him. There he goes.

00:54:58.125 --> 00:54:59.749
Don't let him go.

00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:10.249
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:55:11.166 --> 00:55:13.832
"govinda aala re.."

00:55:15.416 --> 00:55:32.124
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.582
Let's sit down and talk.

00:55:50.833 --> 00:55:52.374
All l did was file a case.

00:55:52.875 --> 00:55:55.249
If you try to talk
they'll cut you in half.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.499
Look behind.

00:55:56.833 --> 00:55:58.249
Catch him.

00:55:58.333 --> 00:55:59.707
Faster!

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.249
Who are you?

00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:05.999
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.

00:56:06.333 --> 00:56:07.249
What?

00:56:07.333 --> 00:56:10.374
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.457
So you're from UP.

00:56:12.666 --> 00:56:15.165
You can call me Kanhaiyya.

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:16.540
Catch him, catch him.

00:56:19.416 --> 00:56:20.415
Catch him.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.207
Careful.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.832
Are you a man or a stuntman?

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.874
You can call me a stuntman as well.

00:56:49.375 --> 00:56:51.915
But people call
my stunts a miracle.

00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:54.499
Miracle.
- Hold on.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.915
You aren't wearing a helmet either.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.749
There he is.

00:56:58.833 --> 00:57:00.790
There's a lot of traffic on earth.

00:57:05.875 --> 00:57:07.832
Where do you think you're going,
go that way.

00:57:09.666 --> 00:57:11.040
Drive on the road.

00:57:24.625 --> 00:57:25.624
Faster!

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.707
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:31.665
That was a narrow escape.

00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:33.999
Now, take me to Brahmanwadi.

00:57:35.416 --> 00:57:40.707
Go straight then take a left,
then right and another left.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.957
And you'll be home, go on.

00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:45.499
You brought me this far,
so drop me home as well.

00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:47.082
My job's to show the way..

00:57:47.166 --> 00:57:49.124
..it's yourjob to
get to the destination.

00:57:54.375 --> 00:57:55.249
Keep it.

00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:56.040
Thank you so much.

00:57:56.125 --> 00:57:57.874
You're so kind.
- Thank you.

00:57:58.166 --> 00:58:00.665
Take care.
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

00:58:10.208 --> 00:58:12.999
Papa!
- Sushila.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.915
Is everything fine?

00:58:15.708 --> 00:58:17.582
Go up and take a look in the house,
you'll know.

00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:19.624
Thankfully we survived, otherwise..

00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:21.290
No, I'll talk to the police.

00:58:21.375 --> 00:58:22.207
Don't worry.

00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:26.915
They hurled stones and
acid bottles in our house.

00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:29.665
I don't care lf I die.

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:31.040
But the children.

00:58:31.791 --> 00:58:34.499
If Jigna would've
been hit by that acid..

00:58:34.583 --> 00:58:35.957
I won't let anything
happen to them.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.165
I am their father. Please.

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:38.749
So, understand the
duties of a father.

00:58:38.833 --> 00:58:40.665
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.874
I'm about to lose my house.

00:58:45.166 --> 00:58:46.582
Where will we stay?

00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:49.207
On the streets, or in their house?

00:58:50.333 --> 00:58:52.874
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?

00:58:52.958 --> 00:58:54.582
Come on, Jigna. Sit in the car.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.374
He's made a mess of things.

00:58:57.458 --> 00:58:59.040
I won't leave papa.

00:59:00.208 --> 00:59:01.707
I'll slap you if you refuse.
- No, mother.

00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:03.624
Come inside, sit inside.

00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:07.707
Please..

00:59:52.166 --> 00:59:55.332
Hello.

00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:57.999
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).

00:59:58.083 --> 00:59:58.874
What?

00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:02.165
If you were a Muslim,
I would've said Allah.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.415
If you were a Christian,
then Jesus Christ.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.124
You're a Hindu, so Krishna.

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:14.415
You, here?

01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:19.249
You're an excellent stuntman,
really.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:20.082
Very good.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.165
I'm sure you're
acting is decent as well.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.582
Why don't you approach
some television channel?

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:30.165
They keep remaking
Ramayan and Mahabharat.

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:32.165
Krishna.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:35.999
Suited-booted Krishna.

01:00:36.541 --> 01:00:38.082
Here to teach me a lesson.

01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:41.082
Look.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:43.374
Look there.

01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:45.165
Gods are bare-bodied.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.790
Like this.

01:00:47.291 --> 01:00:49.624
They're never fully covered.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.707
That's your wedding photo, right?
- Yes.

01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:54.040
Wearing that traditional attire.

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:56.374
So, did you only wear
a traditional attire..

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:57.665
..since your wedding?

01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:59.290
No, right?
- No.

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:02.624
See. That's our older image.

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:05.207
Conch in one hand,
mace in the other.

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.999
Where are yours?

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:10.040
If l keep holding them all day,
won't my arms hurt?

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:13.832
Think.

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:16.874
Actually, our latest photos
haven't been updated on Facebook.

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:18.957
People still use the
older ones, and we let them.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.999
We don't have a problem.

01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:21.999
Let them.
- That's enough.

01:01:22.208 --> 01:01:23.915
You're boring me now.
Get out, leave.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:28.457
Mahadev!

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:33.582
Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.999
Yes, coming. Coming.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.957
Mahadev!

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.624
What happened?
What happened, Kanji?

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:44.915
See him.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.790
He calls himself God.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:48.832
I can see him.

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:50.374
He can see you.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.457
My name's Krishna,
your new neighbour.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.415
Neighbour?

01:01:57.666 --> 01:02:00.040
The person Kanji had
mortgaged his house to..

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.457
..has sold it to me.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.249
Here are the documents.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:11.040
And, Kanji bhai,
sorry for that joke about God.

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:14.124
What's this?

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:16.832
How can he sell my house to him?

01:02:17.041 --> 01:02:18.915
I was about to pay him on time.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:19.999
I already paid him.

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.290
This isn't done.

01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:22.624
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.

01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:25.124
Relax. Chill.

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:28.707
When you get your
compensation from God..

01:02:28.791 --> 01:02:32.624
..you can repay me, I will leave.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:35.707
And anyway, l always leave
after my project is over.

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:39.124
Why buy the house
when you want to leave?

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:40.707
Are you a agent?

01:02:42.666 --> 01:02:44.124
I am not that low.

01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:45.832
I've a consultancy firm.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.415
I give advice to people.
- Advice.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.499
Anyone who thinks of me.

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.249
Public service.
Service open to all.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:55.040
A solution to every problem.

01:02:55.666 --> 01:02:58.124
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.957
But...I always get there on time.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:01.749
There's delay but not denial.

01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:03.790
Just like l came here,
to help Kanji bhai.

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:05.582
Help me?

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:07.040
I found out about your condition..

01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:08.582
..only after I brought the house.

01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:10.874
The court case, lost your shop..

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.165
..and your wife and children too.

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:14.124
Kanji bhai, don't worry.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:15.915
You can stay here.

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:19.249
In return,
I will only use your things.

01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:20.957
Television, fridge, etcetera.

01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.290
Fine, but remember..

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.374
..one day I will
buy this house back from you.

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:29.665
So be it!

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:31.832
I mean, I promise.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:35.290
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:37.332
No, just.. Cheers.

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:41.457
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.

01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:45.540
Thank you, for letting
me stay in my own house.

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:47.040
Thank you so much.

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:49.457
Thank you.

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:53.332
I will sleep outside
on the terrace.

01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:55.165
And you can sleep
wherever you want.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.290
It's your house.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.165
Thank you. Goodnight.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.749
And yes,
the light switch is at the back.

01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:02.415
Switch off the lights
before you go to sleep.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.540
Another power failure.

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:13.707
No. you switched it off.
- No, I didn't.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.040
You're drunk.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:16.124
So?

01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:19.790
I see.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:47.790
"Go...go...go...Govinda."

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.874
Case on God admitted. Paper,
paper, paper.

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:16.624
High Court has put it's seal on it.

01:05:23.166 --> 01:05:25.915
Through the notice prepared
by advocate Hanif Qureshi..

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.790
..Kanji Lalji Mehta's case
on God has been accepted.

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:29.999
I think he's mad.

01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:31.207
I'm leaving.

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:32.457
Hey Jigna, what happened?

01:05:38.916 --> 01:05:40.999
See, his wife ran away.

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.790
Who can live with that madman?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.040
I don't even talk to him.

01:05:45.125 --> 01:05:47.124
Or the Lord might
punish us as well.

01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:54.957
What a splendid bike.
- But, who is he?

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.874
I think he arrived just last night.

01:05:58.958 --> 01:06:01.915
Who's playing this classical music?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.582
I've heard that the new
guest is really handsome.

01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:08.624
Don't l look handsome?

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:10.415
Get inside.

01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:18.832
Hey, Hari Prasad.

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:22.540
Hey, Chaurasiya.

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:25.040
What's all this?

01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:27.040
I was waking up the birds!

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:28.124
What? Who?

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:29.999
I was waking up the birds!

01:06:30.416 --> 01:06:32.082
Practice. I was practising.

01:06:32.625 --> 01:06:33.999
It's a good thing to
do in the morning.

01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:36.249
Don't do it.
Don't do all this in my house.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:40.582
It's your house you can
play anything you want.

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:42.749
Good morning.
- What?

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.832
Not me,
there's a lady in your house.

01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:49.249
Hello.

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:51.582
I brought breakfast.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:53.832
I thought since sister-in-law
isn't home, so.. - No need.

01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:55.540
I'll have bread and butter.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.124
Where's the butter?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.249
I ate it.

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:07.290
There was half a kilo of butter
in there, you ate it all.

01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:09.665
It's my favourite thing.
So l ate it.

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:10.999
Tell me one thing.

01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:13.082
Why do they make it so salty?

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.165
Just like his name.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:17.832
Are you all alone?

01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:19.540
Your wife?
- Of course.

01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:20.999
Sixteen thousand..
- What?

01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:22.124
She lives in Sholapur.

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:26.457
What did you hear?
- Sixteen thousand.

01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:29.165
No, she lives in Sholapur.

01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:30.957
He can't handle one..

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.624
..how can I have sixteen thousand.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:34.957
Please go. He's a big liar.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.249
He was boring me yesterday.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:38.582
Please go.
- Give it.

01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:42.707
If you eat all that
you'll get a stomach ache.

01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:44.457
First half a kilo of
butter and now this.

01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:46.082
I'll be fine.

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:51.499
Hello.
- Sir, I'm speaking from ABP News.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:53.499
I am standing below your house.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:55.749
Sir.

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:59.207
Look, l don't want to be
a piece of news for you.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.582
And don't call me again.

01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:04.165
Sir, just one interview.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:09.332
Since he filed a case
against God, he's become alone.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.499
One has to tread
on such a path alone.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:17.332
Let's see how far our friend goes.

01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:22.374
The advocate who
prepared Kanji's notice.

01:08:22.458 --> 01:08:23.999
He lives that way.

01:08:24.083 --> 01:08:26.040
Excuse me, advocate Hanif Qureshi.

01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:27.790
He lives right there.

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:30.249
Where does advocate
Hanif Qureshi live?

01:08:30.333 --> 01:08:31.749
He lives right there.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.082
Advocate Hanif Qureshi lives there.

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:43.374
155 letters, and calls too.

01:08:44.083 --> 01:08:47.457
Bhuj, Latur, Vishakapatnam.

01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:50.624
Their claims haven't
been approved..

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:54.249
..for the past few
years due to 'Act of God'.

01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:59.582
All they all want you
to defend their cases.

01:09:00.458 --> 01:09:05.457
Son, I've lost my
house in the earthquake.

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:11.874
My son and his wife died too.

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:17.499
This is my grandson.

01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:20.665
His cancer needs to be operated.

01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:25.457
If l get the insurance money,
everything will be alright.

01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:28.249
This is Aslam.

01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:29.332
Hello.
- Hello.

01:09:29.708 --> 01:09:31.707
He lost everything in the Tsunami.

01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:36.082
He lost all the money he had
saved for his sister's marriage.

01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:40.040
So you file a case too.

01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:41.665
I'll be cast out..

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:45.749
..if l go against
the priest or community.

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:48.165
Look, Aslam.
You aren't going against anyone.

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:52.915
Those who taught you religion,
taught you to pray..

01:09:53.208 --> 01:09:57.499
..you're just questioning
them why Allah did this to you.

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:01.540
But, the priest..
- Aslam.

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:04.874
When you lose your home..

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.290
..will the priest let
you stay in his house?

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:13.832
Religion is for people,
people aren't made for religion.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:23.540
Hanif, how long will it
take to ready their papers?

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:25.957
As long as it will take me to type.

01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:28.290
Let's begin.

01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:53.165
First one crore, and now
claims worth 400 crores.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:54.665
Kanji Mehta!

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.707
Advocate Sardesai
is caught between..

01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:58.915
..the insurance company
and religious organizations.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.165
For God's sake,
prove that God exists.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:03.499
And...and...
make God pay all this!

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:07.040
The temples, mosques, churches,
they will pay everything.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:08.124
Kanji.

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:10.624
Wasn't your fight with your God?

01:11:10.708 --> 01:11:12.957
Silence please!
- So why call me here?

01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:18.665
Priest, how can I say
which God of which religion..

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:23.082
..was behind this earthquake,
or that Tsunami?

01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:25.124
That's your department.

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:28.915
Your Honour, they're in
constant touch with God.

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:30.832
They're always in contact.

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:34.999
Why don't you tell me
Who was responsible?

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:38.665
Why would our God harm
people of our own religion?

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:40.249
God will never do such a thing!

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:41.999
Silence.
- He loves his children!

01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:44.749
Allah doesn't hate
his followers either!

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.582
Relax.
- Please be seated.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.124
The court needs some time
to study all these cases.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:58.207
Anyone related to this
case cannot leave the country.

01:11:58.291 --> 01:11:59.374
What?

01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:00.457
Court is adjourned.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:15.249
Long live..
- Kanji!

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:21.457
This is government property,
you're safe here.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:30.207
But how will you escape them,
in temples, churches and mosques?

01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:51.499
What are you thinking, Leeladhar?

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:54.790
This has gone beyond the limit.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.999
Stop all the shams that you're
running in the name of faith.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.040
Otherwise, the day isn't far when..

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:09.707
..no one will even spare
alms in the name of God.

01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:12.832
Thank you.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.999
You don't understand, Leeladhar..
- Thank you.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.499
This is actually a serious matter.

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:45.249
People are making him a hero..

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:48.999
..and the claim
amount is increasing.

01:13:49.041 --> 01:13:51.332
Will you just tell us about
the problems or do something?

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:54.374
Next week,
I've a religious programme..

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:56.124
..on the Star Cruise, in Singapore

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.999
And the judge says
I cannot leave the country.

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:00.999
Do something.
- I would.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:03.207
But it's the court,
not the parliament..

01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:06.165
..where we can break a few
chairs and the job's done.

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:07.999
It's the court.

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:09.540
Let me think.

01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:11.832
Well, there's one way.

01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:13.124
I know it's an old idea..

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:15.207
..but these days
it's a lot in fashion.

01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:17.874
Laxman Mishra guarantees..

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:19.624
..that you'll get
the sympathy of people.

01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:21.040
I guarantee it.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.499
Thank you.

01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:26.040
Lord blessed us with everything.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.332
The earth, the air, water,
the flora, fauna, everything.

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:36.540
Did He ever ask us for service tax?
- No?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.040
Did he ever ask us for sales tax?
- No.

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:45.249
And today, a madman has
dragged Him to court..

01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:50.207
..so, will we stay quiet?
- No.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.499
We will fight.

01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:54.707
We will fight together.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:15:00.707
And so, guiding us on
this path, our beloved..

01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:09.749
..and revered Sri Siddeshwar
Maharaj will fast unto death.

01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:12.499
He will go on a hunger strike.

01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:16.874
Glory to..
- Siddeshwar Maharaj

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:20.915
Today's the third day of
Siddeshwar Maharaj's hunger strike.

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:23.332
Many religious
organizations and devotees..

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:27.665
..from different parts of the country
have supported this movement.

01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:30.290
On the other hand,
Kanji Lalji Mehta..

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:32.915
..has refused to talk to the media.

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:34.874
He won't take a sip of water.

01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:36.082
He won't stop.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.082
He's an ascetic.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:47.499
Repeat after me, Glory
to Ram, glory to Sita-Ram!

01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:04.957
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.332
And what does God say?

01:16:07.666 --> 01:16:10.249
Awaken the power of your devotion.

01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:14.790
And go tell Kanji, you
can do anything you want.

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:19.415
We will continue..

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:22.499
They're defaming me
taking Krishna's name.

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.332
Mine too.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:26.082
What have you got to do with this?

01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:27.165
I do.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.290
When they're defaming you,
they're defaming me too.

01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:31.832
You're my friend after all.

01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:35.582
Look, Kanji bhai, it's
the era of publicity.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:39.457
These imposters like to show off.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.957
I am fighting for my right,
that's all.

01:16:42.666 --> 01:16:45.874
And you will win this fight
only when you expose their lies..

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:50.040
..and that's possible only
when you speak to the people.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:55.165
Even Krishna had to
enter the ring to kill Kans.

01:16:55.833 --> 01:16:58.207
Enough of your fairytales.

01:16:59.458 --> 01:17:01.665
But I did understand one thing.

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:07.790
Now watch...
how I expose them and their God.

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.624
He's not going to spare me.

01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:19.624
Hello, and welcome to
a very special episode..

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:20.999
..of Oh My God!

01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:22.957
Why is this episode special?

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:25.707
Because Kanji Lalji Mehta..

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:30.624
..is finally here to
answer all your questions.

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:35.540
Many of you think
he's crazy and cynical.

01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:39.999
He's the person who...
filed the case against God.

01:17:41.041 --> 01:17:42.582
Kanji bhai, welcome to our show.

01:17:42.666 --> 01:17:44.499
My first question is..

01:17:44.916 --> 01:17:46.915
Why are you after all
the religious sects?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.832
You media personnel, I tell you..

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:54.082
Your questions sound
more like allegations..

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:56.165
..and make us sound guilty.

01:17:57.416 --> 01:18:00.624
I respect all religion
and don't believe in any.

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:02.207
This man will never change.

01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:04.832
And if God exists,
he will answer all my questions.

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:07.707
Not just that,
he will support me in my fight.

01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:09.540
How?

01:18:12.708 --> 01:18:14.957
When you were small, a small child.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.749
What would you do to ask
your papa for chocolate?

01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:22.582
I mean, would you chant his name.

01:18:22.666 --> 01:18:24.499
"Papa, give me chocolates."

01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:26.999
Or, did you venerate
him with incense sticks..

01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:29.040
..or throw flowers...
- No, I didn't do any of that.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.332
I would directly ask him
whatever I wanted. - Exactly.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.040
Exactly. I'm doing the same thing.

01:18:34.541 --> 01:18:39.332
People have always told me,
that God is like a father-figure.

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:43.499
Maybe? But how can I believe,
as long as I don't see Him.

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:47.124
You're an atheist,
how can God appear before you?

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:50.457
Eat. Eat.

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:55.790
Kanji bhai, even I believe that
God's like a father-figure. - Yes.

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:57.707
So, will he appear before me?

01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:00.040
Do you believe in temples,
idols etcetera?

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:03.082
Yes, I do.
- Then He won't.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:04.249
But why?

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.499
Because you're searching
for Him in temples and idols.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.374
Then why does
He have to come personally?

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.165
No, this is wrong.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.874
God does exist.

01:19:11.958 --> 01:19:13.790
I couldn't find
a decent job for two years.

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:17.582
I prayed that if I find a job,
I will shave my head.

01:19:17.666 --> 01:19:19.374
And see, I found a job.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.582
Oh, you shaved
off the entire thing.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.374
Just imagine.

01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:28.665
You're all dressed and
leaving for work in the morning..

01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:30.957
..and as soon as
you open your door..

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.540
..you see a pile of hair.

01:19:33.916 --> 01:19:36.999
Black hair, white hair,
some with dandruff.

01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:38.624
Some have lice.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.749
There's a pile of
every kind of hair.

01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:43.999
Tell me how you will feel.

01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:45.540
I won't like it at all.

01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:48.665
Isn't it? So,
imagine how bad God feels.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.915
God opens his door,
and there's hair scattered around.

01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:54.874
Kanji bhai always
has the right logic.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.540
Do you know what's
done with all these hairs?

01:19:57.541 --> 01:20:00.207
They are sold.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:04.124
These hairs are sold in America,
London, etcetera...

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:08.082
In short, your faith is sold.

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:09.332
That's it.

01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:12.165
He is right.

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:14.082
He's got a point.

01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:17.332
But that money is used to
run schools, orphanages..

01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:19.415
..hospitals, charitable trusts.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.790
Do you have a problem
with that too?

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:24.499
It's just like a tobacco
seller builds a cancer hospital.

01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:28.540
They have to do
these things, madam.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.832
Because all this
is unaccounted money.

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:33.540
If you don't show
any legal transaction..

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.999
..then the Income Tax
people will put you behind bars.

01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:39.582
I've a problem with their
way of extracting the money.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.290
Just like the mafia
scares us with a gun..

01:20:42.375 --> 01:20:44.124
..these people scare us
in the name of the Lord.

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:45.124
That's a good one.

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:47.040
"Your child's stars
are unfavourable."

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.415
"He's unlucky."

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.290
"There's an inauspicious
issue in his horoscope."

01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:52.457
"Saturn's influencing his stars..."

01:20:52.541 --> 01:20:53.540
What is this?

01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:57.499
He is just born, let him breathe.

01:20:58.125 --> 01:21:01.999
And this is where all
their religious hoaxes begin.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.707
Not just this lifetime,
but they also scare you..

01:21:04.791 --> 01:21:06.707
..in the name of
your next life. Yes.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.749
If you don't do this and this..

01:21:08.833 --> 01:21:10.832
..then you'll become a
dog in your next lifetime.

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:14.624
Or, if you do this,
you'll be born as a insect..

01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:15.707
..and go to hell.

01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:18.707
And then, they read out an
entire itinerary of hell.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.749
You'll be made to
sleep on a bed of nails.

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:23.457
Thrown in the sea of fire.

01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:25.415
Fried in hot oil.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.832
Am I a man or a fritter?

01:21:30.875 --> 01:21:32.999
Wonderful, Kanji.

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:37.790
Too good.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.207
So, what's the definition of
religion according to you?

01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:44.832
I believe, where there's religion..

01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:46.832
..there's no place for honesty.

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:50.874
And where there's truth,
you don't need religion.

01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:52.207
He's absolutely right.

01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:54.165
What's the role..

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.290
..of caste and
religion in a person's life?

01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:09.415
They do just one thing, madam.

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:12.040
Either it makes them helpless.

01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:13.665
..or a terrorist.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:21.332
He's too good.

01:22:21.416 --> 01:22:22.749
He'll never change.
- Sister.

01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:24.374
Oh my God.

01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:26.915
Oh my God, Kanji bhai.

01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:30.499
Really, you've changed
my concept about God.

01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:31.582
Honestly.

01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:33.540
No matter what the
verdict of the court is..

01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:35.957
..the young generation today,
not just the young..

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.582
..but every generation
needs to think like you.

01:22:38.666 --> 01:22:39.665
I applaud you.

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:42.332
Hey, guys. He's my father.

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:55.707
"Sanskrit chants."

01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:57.165
Just a minute, priest.

01:22:57.541 --> 01:23:01.207
Explain us the
meaning of these chants.

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:03.624
Priest, your fees is
500 rupees, right.

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:04.749
We will pay you that.

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:08.707
We'll pay you 5 rupees for
every mantra you explain.

01:23:08.791 --> 01:23:09.624
Let's go.

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:11.290
They've seen Kanji
bhai's interview as well.

01:23:11.375 --> 01:23:13.415
Let's go from here, come on.
- Priest.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.707
Someone placed a big stone
in the middle of the ground.

01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:20.165
And a few people anointed that
stone and adorned it with garlands.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.040
Now, people call this
the temple of Hanuman..

01:23:22.125 --> 01:23:23.832
..they tie bells here and pray.

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:26.707
This is the only ground.
Where else can we play?

01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:27.790
If the BMC doesn't do anything..

01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:30.207
..then we will talk to Kanji bhai..
- Yes, yes..

01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:34.374
No, no. That man spares no one.

01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:35.749
I will move this temple.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:55.915
"Hail Krishna."

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.790
"Hail Krishna."
- Miracle.

01:23:59.291 --> 01:24:01.499
Swami.
- Yes.

01:24:02.166 --> 01:24:03.999
Relieve me from this hunger-strike.

01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:06.707
Each time l've to go to the
toilet for eating the fritter.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.332
Manage a few more days..

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:11.832
..otherwise you'll have to
starve for the rest of your life.

01:24:12.458 --> 01:24:15.332
You've rented such a big ground.

01:24:15.416 --> 01:24:17.040
But now nobody comes here.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:19.290
The few that are here..

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:20.874
..are the ones who
rented this dais to us.

01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:24.665
I fear that if people
start believing in Kanji..

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.540
..then they will
lose their faith in us.

01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:29.790
What if they stop
coming to the temple?

01:24:30.291 --> 01:24:31.749
That won't happen.

01:24:33.166 --> 01:24:35.915
In this country,
people visit the temple..

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.665
..more than they visit the school.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:44.999
The High Court has
accepted 455 cases..

01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:47.665
..but we'll have
to wait and watch..

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.832
..Kanji Lalji Mehta's
argument in the court.

01:24:52.041 --> 01:24:53.332
Siddeshwar Maharaj.

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:57.874
What's the area of your temple?

01:24:59.208 --> 01:25:00.499
22 acres.

01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:04.957
It has 322 small temples of God.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.290
Meaning, there's an entire
shopping mall of Gods inside.

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.499
Silence.

01:25:14.833 --> 01:25:19.915
There are 142 priests to serve
the Lord in all these temples.

01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:24.165
Do you know how many
beggars are outside your temple?

01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:26.249
What?
- Beggars.

01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:30.707
You remember the 320
idols and 142 priests..

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:36.124
..but you do you know how many
beggars sit outside your temple?

01:25:36.416 --> 01:25:39.457
Your Honour, the beggars
outside their temple..

01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:41.499
..are restricted
from coming inside. No!

01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:43.707
Whether its scorching heat, or
rains, just keep rotting outside.

01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:44.999
Don't set foot inside.

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.040
Don't say no.

01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:49.124
A priest from your
temple told me so.

01:25:49.791 --> 01:25:51.874
And he also said to me..

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:56.707
"..Kanji bhai, if you
want to win this case.."

01:25:56.791 --> 01:25:58.332
"..then come here every Monday."

01:25:58.791 --> 01:26:00.790
So l asked "Where should I come".

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:02.957
He said, "Come to
Lord Shiva's temple".

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.624
"Offer a bowl of
milk and then watch".

01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:08.332
I thought, fine, let's try it.

01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:10.374
Your Honour, I went
there on a Monday..

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.832
..with a bowl of milk,
standing in the long queue.

01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:16.249
Everyone was holding
bowl in their hands.

01:26:17.083 --> 01:26:19.415
I thought there must be
someone inside to drink the milk.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.832
All of them aren't fools to
stand in the line holding a jug.

01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:24.124
It was my turn, Your Honour.

01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:26.207
I went inside, but
there was no in there.

01:26:26.291 --> 01:26:28.082
No one to drink the milk?

01:26:28.958 --> 01:26:31.499
Just then I noticed black stone.

01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:33.874
It's called 'Shiva's phallus,
you fool.

01:26:33.958 --> 01:26:36.165
Yes, there was a 'Shiva's phallus.

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:37.707
And that stone.

01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:39.540
That stone was
completely immersed in milk.

01:26:39.916 --> 01:26:44.874
And right besides the phallus,
through a small drain..

01:26:44.958 --> 01:26:47.124
..the milk was going outside.

01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:50.499
I thought "Yes, there must be
someone outside to drink the milk".

01:26:50.916 --> 01:26:52.499
But when I saw there was
no one outside as well.

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:59.082
All the milk was
going into the sewers.

01:26:59.166 --> 01:27:00.165
The sewers.

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:01.665
Total waste.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.415
And there was a beggar
standing right besides the sewer.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.582
He must've been hungry
for the past 4-5 days.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.624
He was shivering.

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.999
Maybe he wanted to drink the milk..

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:13.707
..but he couldn't do
so from the sewers.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.457
I gave that beggar my bowl of milk.

01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:19.999
And do you know what
he said after he drank the milk?

01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:23.124
God bless you!

01:27:29.958 --> 01:27:32.040
If every person
visiting the temple..

01:27:32.125 --> 01:27:35.665
..gives the milk
to a needy instead..

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.499
..then they will earn more merits.

01:27:37.583 --> 01:27:38.582
Right?

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:47.374
If you donate
blankets to a poor beggar..

01:27:47.666 --> 01:27:52.499
..instead of offering it to shrine,
it will make Allah happy.

01:27:55.916 --> 01:27:58.790
And if you light a candle
in some poor man's hut..

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:03.082
..instead of the church, they he'll
never have to live in the darkness.

01:28:06.375 --> 01:28:09.665
Don't you believe in God?
- I am God.

01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:11.915
And l am Amitabh Bachchan!

01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:15.665
Look, Kanji.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:20.665
Offering milk, candles,
blanket is a tradition.

01:28:21.166 --> 01:28:23.124
Worshipping the Lord.

01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:27.665
But you won't
understand their value..

01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:29.249
..because you are an atheist.

01:28:30.041 --> 01:28:32.915
You're still bounded by
the illusions of this world.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.374
But you aren't.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.790
You're at the
threshold of salvation.

01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:40.374
So, why not stop the shams under the
pretext of rituals and traditions?

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.582
Do you know how much oil
is wasted on Saturday..

01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:45.249
..on Lord Shani's idol?

01:28:46.208 --> 01:28:50.624
People stick coins
on the idol like this.

01:28:51.208 --> 01:28:53.165
What will Hanuman do
with all that change?

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.332
Kanji is absolutely right.

01:28:56.208 --> 01:28:59.999
Sai Baba lived in poverty
all his life, for the poor.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.999
As long as he was alive..

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:05.540
..he wandered around
for a drop of oil.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.540
And today, after he's dead.

01:29:08.166 --> 01:29:09.832
Throne worth millions.

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:14.999
Gold crown. What for?

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:18.999
Tell me one thing.

01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:24.040
Anyone who is a
faithful devotee of the Lord..

01:29:24.458 --> 01:29:27.749
..is blessed with His grace.

01:29:27.916 --> 01:29:28.915
Right?

01:29:30.166 --> 01:29:33.499
Right?
- Yes.

01:29:33.583 --> 01:29:36.624
So tell me,
why does a bus heading..

01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:41.749
..for a trip to Amarnath or
Vaishno Devi falls in the ravine?

01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:44.665
They were going to serve the Lord.

01:29:45.166 --> 01:29:47.915
They were going with complete faith
and singing religious discourses.

01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:49.790
So, the Lord called them directly.

01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:52.999
And show me one car
which met with an accident..

01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:56.499
..and doesn't have God's
idol or photo kept inside.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.165
Speak.
- I object, Your Honour.

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:03.707
From day 1 this man's
trying to twist the case around.

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:06.374
Mr. Kanji, this isn't
a debate about good and bad.

01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:08.540
This is the court,
we only believe on proofs here.

01:30:08.916 --> 01:30:11.999
And we have proof, your signatures
on the insurance papers.

01:30:12.916 --> 01:30:14.290
And legally you have no right
to ask for any compensation..

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.415
..from the insurance company.

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.124
And as far as we're concerned.

01:30:18.958 --> 01:30:21.749
We don't believe in the
insurance company's conditions.

01:30:23.666 --> 01:30:27.332
If they say that the
judge caused the earthquake..

01:30:27.666 --> 01:30:29.457
..will the judge have
to pay you compensation?

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:32.374
Similarly, if God's name
is written on the policy..

01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:35.124
..he isn't liable to
pay the compensation.

01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:39.374
If you want God to
give you compensation.

01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:42.332
Then prove that God
caused this earthquake.

01:30:42.666 --> 01:30:44.749
He did..
- But, in writing.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.999
Do you have it...in writing?

01:30:49.625 --> 01:30:51.207
Do you have it? Any proof?

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.957
Your Honour..
- Mr. Kanji, the court of law..

01:30:58.208 --> 01:31:00.290
..cannot give a verdict
on just arguments alone.

01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:05.915
Your arguments maybe
valid for the common people..

01:31:06.416 --> 01:31:10.832
..but if you cannot
prove them, it has no value.

01:31:11.916 --> 01:31:13.332
Do you have any proof?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.540
No. - In that case, the
court gives you a month's time..

01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:22.665
..which is your last chance.

01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:26.374
On the next hearing, if you
cannot produce any evidence..

01:31:26.708 --> 01:31:31.832
..then l'm afraid you will have
to rest your case and all others.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.540
Court is adjourned for the day.

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:39.624
Relax.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.249
Next time I see you
in this courtroom..

01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:44.665
..I will sue you for defamation,
and you'll lose..

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:46.499
..whatever you have left.

01:31:48.208 --> 01:31:49.207
Relax.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.749
What will you do now? How will
you prove it in the court now?

01:32:09.083 --> 01:32:10.624
Because you're not alone,
Mr. Kanji.

01:32:10.708 --> 01:32:12.165
It's a matter of crores of rupees.

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:14.165
Many people have hopes with you.

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:17.082
Sir, how will you get a proof in writing?
- Sir, what about these people now?

01:32:31.833 --> 01:32:33.540
You aren't playing
your flute today.

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:36.499
You don't like it,
so l'm sitting quietly.

01:32:37.291 --> 01:32:40.499
I like it. You play it well too.

01:32:41.083 --> 01:32:42.415
Thank you.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.290
You look worried.
- Yes.

01:32:45.375 --> 01:32:48.999
The court says get us proof,
and in writing.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.707
How do I get proof?

01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:53.249
There's a consultant sitting
right next to you, ask me.

01:32:55.083 --> 01:32:57.332
This isn't some housing loan issue.

01:32:58.416 --> 01:32:59.665
It's a court case.

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.124
It's a big problem.

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:02.540
I've a suggestion.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.665
Give me the alcohol.

01:33:07.166 --> 01:33:08.249
You drink this milk.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:09.832
You want me to mix them.

01:33:09.916 --> 01:33:11.999
No, no, just drink the milk.

01:33:12.458 --> 01:33:13.999
And l will give you the solution.

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.332
You know, Kanji,
where's the solution..

01:33:19.416 --> 01:33:22.540
..to all the problems,
tensions and trouble written?

01:33:22.875 --> 01:33:24.874
Where?
- In this book.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:28.499
'Shrimad Bhagvad Gita.'

01:33:28.583 --> 01:33:30.582
Have your read it?
- Who can possibly read it?

01:33:30.666 --> 01:33:31.874
It's such a thick book.

01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:33.207
And not a single photograph.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.540
How can anyone read it,
it's not interesting at all.

01:33:37.416 --> 01:33:38.665
I used to keep it in my shop.

01:33:38.916 --> 01:33:40.040
But it would fetch a small margin.

01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:42.374
Plus it catches termites.

01:33:42.458 --> 01:33:44.582
It causes problems.
So l threw it out.

01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:45.915
Threw it?
- Yes, l threw it.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.749
You threw the Bhagwad Gita out.
- Yes.

01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:48.832
Wow!
- Why?

01:33:50.833 --> 01:33:53.749
Kanji, the Gita,
Bible, Koran has answers..

01:33:53.833 --> 01:33:55.874
..to every problems of humans.

01:33:56.541 --> 01:33:58.582
I know you don't
believe in all this.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:03.082
But for your own good,
read this book once.

01:34:04.875 --> 01:34:05.999
And see the result.

01:34:06.291 --> 01:34:07.957
And if the result isn't good..

01:34:08.708 --> 01:34:10.040
..then you can throw it out.

01:34:12.083 --> 01:34:14.874
Kanji bhai read it once,
and then see.

01:34:30.125 --> 01:34:34.874
"l am not human."

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:38.832
"l am sold in stores."

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.707
"l created the world."

01:34:44.958 --> 01:34:48.999
"Not with mud,
but with my emotions."

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:52.207
"l am wandering around.."

01:34:52.291 --> 01:34:58.040
"..looking for my signs,
where are they."

01:34:58.291 --> 01:35:02.874
"Where are my signs?"

01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:05.249
Stop begging in the name of Allah.

01:35:05.708 --> 01:35:07.540
Stop begging and do some hard work.

01:35:10.291 --> 01:35:15.249
"My signs."

01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:55.540
"l was always with
you as your shadow."

01:35:55.916 --> 01:36:00.874
"l gave you shade when
the heat was strong."

01:36:00.958 --> 01:36:09.207
"l was your
companion in yourjourney."

01:36:10.625 --> 01:36:15.124
"Still you're confused."

01:36:15.458 --> 01:36:19.957
"Looking for your
answers in the question."

01:36:20.416 --> 01:36:24.624
"Where are you lost?"

01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:36.374
"Where are my signs?"

01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:58.124
"My signs."

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:14.374
Wear your slippers.
- Oh.

01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:17.374
Thief.

01:37:17.791 --> 01:37:19.124
Those are my slippers.

01:37:20.416 --> 01:37:23.124
"Where are my signs?"

01:37:23.208 --> 01:37:25.165
Sir, shoe polish.
- No.

01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:26.957
Sir, recognise me.
The beggar outside the shrine.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.457
You told me to make
an honest living.

01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:30.082
Shake hands, shake hands.

01:37:32.291 --> 01:37:36.249
"My signs."

01:37:44.958 --> 01:37:47.707
Today's the last hearing on
the case filed against God.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.832
The claim amount
is 400 crore rupees.

01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.999
Can Kanji bhai win this case?

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.040
We'll have to wait and watch.

01:37:56.333 --> 01:37:57.915
You can please proceed.

01:37:58.458 --> 01:38:01.457
Your Honour,
before Mr. Kanji can express..

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:03.999
..his sharp and witty
views before the court..

01:38:04.083 --> 01:38:06.707
..without any reference,
I would like to ask..

01:38:07.208 --> 01:38:09.040
..does he have any evidence,
to prove..

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:11.290
..that God has demolished his shop?

01:38:12.166 --> 01:38:15.749
Your Honour,
I require a learned man..

01:38:16.208 --> 01:38:19.540
..for the next
question I'm going to ask.

01:38:20.291 --> 01:38:23.124
So, whoever amongst you is
the learned one can come here.

01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:25.665
The learned one, please come here.

01:38:28.333 --> 01:38:29.707
Please sit down.

01:38:35.208 --> 01:38:36.207
Come.

01:38:49.083 --> 01:38:53.332
You sages always speak
about the scriptures..

01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:54.957
..in their preaching.

01:38:55.166 --> 01:38:57.999
Is everything written
in the scriptures true?

01:38:58.375 --> 01:38:59.582
Absolutely.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.999
It's not written anywhere,
you're saying that.

01:39:02.666 --> 01:39:03.957
It's written in the Gita.

01:39:04.208 --> 01:39:06.374
It is.
What's written in the Gita?

01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:11.749
Chapter four, verse forty of Gita.

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:25.832
"Sanskrit chants."

01:39:25.916 --> 01:39:27.915
Meaning?
- It means..

01:39:28.166 --> 01:39:34.957
Any illiterate, or faithless
person that doubts the Gita..

01:39:35.791 --> 01:39:37.582
..is destined to ruination.

01:39:38.375 --> 01:39:42.499
He stays devoid of
sanctity on earth and on heaven.

01:39:42.583 --> 01:39:44.082
Understood?

01:39:46.333 --> 01:39:48.165
He's an interesting character.

01:39:50.166 --> 01:39:56.249
Do you understand anything written
in The Gita or the Scriptures?

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:58.999
Or are you blindly agreeing..

01:39:59.083 --> 01:40:01.124
..to whatever Leeladhar is saying.

01:40:01.583 --> 01:40:03.915
Your Honour, small
children in school..

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.582
..don't remember the entire prayer.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.040
So they just close
their eyes and...

01:40:08.125 --> 01:40:09.665
Move their lips.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:11.499
They move their lips and
you're moving your hands.

01:40:11.583 --> 01:40:12.999
Kanji.

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:18.374
You've insulted a learned sage.

01:40:18.458 --> 01:40:21.082
So?
- You won't get refuge even in hell.

01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:23.082
How can I?

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.957
You've already
reserved places there.

01:40:32.041 --> 01:40:36.165
How dare you?

01:40:36.625 --> 01:40:38.332
Atheist!

01:40:40.708 --> 01:40:42.165
Silence.
- Leave me! Leave me!

01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:43.749
What are you doing?

01:40:43.833 --> 01:40:46.749
This is the court, sit down.

01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:51.165
Order, order.

01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:55.124
Sit down everyone.

01:41:01.291 --> 01:41:12.624
"Sanskrit chants."

01:41:14.333 --> 01:41:16.749
Chapter 2, verse 56.

01:41:19.125 --> 01:41:24.624
Meaning, a person for whom
happiness and sorrows is equal..

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:30.540
..and is devoid of anger and fear,
and has a calm mind..

01:41:30.958 --> 01:41:32.915
..is called a learned person.

01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:40.165
They'll teach me Gita?

01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:42.749
They can't teach me, Your Honour.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.165
Their IQ is lower than
the room temperature.

01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:52.874
I said a few things
to instigate you..

01:41:53.375 --> 01:41:54.832
..you tried to harm me.

01:41:55.083 --> 01:41:57.749
Is this your achievement,
Siddeshwar?

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.249
Mr. Kanji, the issue
isn't his achievement..

01:42:01.333 --> 01:42:03.582
..the issue here is
who razed down your shop?

01:42:03.916 --> 01:42:04.999
God did.

01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:08.124
You're giving a verdict.
That's the judge's duty.

01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:10.582
You just have to prove..

01:42:10.666 --> 01:42:12.999
..that God caused that earthquake.

01:42:13.041 --> 01:42:14.249
Yes, and it's
impossible to prove that.

01:42:14.333 --> 01:42:15.790
Relax, relax, relax.

01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:17.499
Nothing is impossible.

01:42:19.125 --> 01:42:22.415
Tell me one thing.

01:42:22.875 --> 01:42:26.540
The Lord has narrated the
'Bhagvad Gita'. - Yes.

01:42:26.625 --> 01:42:29.374
And everything said in
the 'Bhagvad Gita' is true.

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.749
Absolutely.

01:42:31.916 --> 01:42:33.290
Point to be noted, Your Honour.

01:42:33.708 --> 01:42:37.790
So tell me, why did God say in the
eight verse of the ninth chapter..

01:42:37.875 --> 01:42:42.790
..of the 'Gita', "I've
created the entire universe.."

01:42:43.208 --> 01:42:45.499
"..and it will be
destroyed on my will".

01:42:45.583 --> 01:42:48.290
"The entire creation
follows my will."

01:42:48.875 --> 01:42:51.999
"lt is only I, who is responsible..

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:54.290
..for its creation
and its destruction."

01:42:55.458 --> 01:42:56.457
And look.

01:42:57.125 --> 01:42:59.499
Your Honour, it's been
said in the Bible as well.

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:03.582
Chapter 54, verse 16.

01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:08.832
"See, it is I who have
created the smith.."

01:43:09.083 --> 01:43:12.124
"..who blows the fire of
coals and produces a weapon.."

01:43:12.208 --> 01:43:13.582
"..fit for his purpose."

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.999
"l've also created the
ravager to destroy."

01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:19.957
And see this.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.582
Also in the Holy Quran.

01:43:22.041 --> 01:43:25.749
Sur-e-Zalzala 99,
verse 108 states that..

01:43:26.083 --> 01:43:29.665
"..the entire earth will
be shaken to its core."

01:43:30.083 --> 01:43:33.749
"And the earth will
spill out its burden."

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.915
"And humans will question,
what's happening."

01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:40.624
"And that day, she
will unveil her plight."

01:43:40.833 --> 01:43:45.290
"Because the Lord
would've ordered her to do so."

01:43:45.541 --> 01:43:46.582
"The Lord."

01:43:54.208 --> 01:43:57.082
All these things
mean the same thing..

01:43:58.208 --> 01:44:00.415
..that my shop was razed down..

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.790
..due to the earthquake
caused by God.

01:44:02.875 --> 01:44:05.665
That means it is an act of God.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.874
It's His doing.

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:11.040
And, all those who
have suffered losses..

01:44:11.125 --> 01:44:15.707
..due to Him, will have
to be compensated by God.

01:44:19.583 --> 01:44:21.665
Otherwise, their collection agents.

01:44:26.041 --> 01:44:27.832
Your Honour, Mr. Kanji is
trying to confuse Leeladhar..

01:44:27.916 --> 01:44:28.999
..with his words.

01:44:29.041 --> 01:44:30.082
Mr. Sardesai.

01:44:31.083 --> 01:44:33.165
What are you doing?
Let him speak.

01:44:33.375 --> 01:44:35.624
If it's proven that God exists..

01:44:35.833 --> 01:44:37.457
..then we won't have to pay.

01:44:37.541 --> 01:44:38.832
I see.

01:44:39.666 --> 01:44:42.540
Now you want to blame us completely.
- Be quiet.

01:44:42.625 --> 01:44:45.540
You cannot blame the Lord
to hide your sins. - Be quiet.

01:44:45.625 --> 01:44:48.124
Because only we have
a copyright on God.

01:44:48.208 --> 01:44:49.665
Copyright?
- Silence.

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.415
Just because you
constructed a few temples..

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.915
..you think God belongs to you..

01:44:53.375 --> 01:44:54.457
Beware.

01:44:54.791 --> 01:44:56.665
Our community won't spare you.

01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:57.999
What's he..
- Silence!

01:44:58.083 --> 01:44:59.290
Relax.

01:45:00.958 --> 01:45:05.374
Until today I had heard
that God is venerated..

01:45:05.458 --> 01:45:08.040
..He is worshipped, prayed to.

01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:12.540
But now l see that
Gods have copyrights too.

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.040
God's copyright?

01:45:17.125 --> 01:45:19.624
These people have
turned God into a brand.

01:45:21.125 --> 01:45:25.374
Now I am assured
that God doesn't exist.

01:45:26.083 --> 01:45:27.082
Not possible.

01:45:27.583 --> 01:45:29.457
Because if He really existed..

01:45:29.791 --> 01:45:32.999
..he would've rid
the world of imposters like you.

01:45:33.958 --> 01:45:37.582
I've already proven what
I wanted to, Your Honour.

01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:40.207
Now the verdict..

01:45:46.625 --> 01:45:48.374
Mr. Kanji, are you alright?

01:45:49.291 --> 01:45:52.540
Mr. kanji, are you alright?

01:45:53.833 --> 01:45:54.832
Mr. Kanji.

01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:58.207
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

01:45:58.291 --> 01:46:00.415
What's wrong with my brother?

01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:02.207
Someone get water.

01:46:02.708 --> 01:46:04.415
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

01:46:05.666 --> 01:46:06.790
Thank you.
- Call the ambulance.

01:46:06.875 --> 01:46:08.124
Call the ambulance.

01:46:16.833 --> 01:46:18.040
Yes, he's here.

01:46:18.375 --> 01:46:19.874
Excuse me.
- Just a minute, just a minute.

01:46:19.958 --> 01:46:23.249
Let me through.
- Please let us pass.

01:46:23.458 --> 01:46:25.290
You cannot go inside.
- No, no, no.

01:46:25.375 --> 01:46:27.665
Please, l said you cannot..
- But he's my husband.

01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:28.999
I want to see him.

01:46:31.625 --> 01:46:34.624
Doctor, is he alright?

01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:36.915
It's a severe attack of paralysis.

01:46:37.125 --> 01:46:38.540
And now he's gone into coma.

01:46:58.333 --> 01:46:59.999
He's on ventilator and..

01:47:00.625 --> 01:47:02.457
..only God can save him now.

01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:17.832
The 400 crore in compensations
under the 'Act of God'..

01:47:17.916 --> 01:47:19.374
..will now be paid out.

01:47:19.458 --> 01:47:22.582
It was his wish that
we should pay, so we did.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.374
Great, Lord.

01:48:14.541 --> 01:48:15.999
Where am l?

01:48:17.125 --> 01:48:18.290
Don't say that.

01:48:21.375 --> 01:48:22.624
You're in the ICU.

01:48:23.125 --> 01:48:24.790
Your wife and children are outside.

01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:27.624
No one's allowed inside.

01:48:29.375 --> 01:48:30.749
Then how did you come in?

01:48:33.083 --> 01:48:34.499
I came here to wake you up.

01:48:37.666 --> 01:48:39.457
It's time for you to get up.

01:48:46.083 --> 01:48:48.165
You cussed God from your heart.

01:48:50.125 --> 01:48:51.624
And where's the heart?

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:53.415
On your left.

01:48:54.083 --> 01:48:57.374
So God has paralysed
your entire left side.

01:48:59.625 --> 01:49:02.207
I am not saying this..

01:49:03.458 --> 01:49:07.207
..it's the media outside
spreading this rumour.

01:49:08.333 --> 01:49:11.624
I can cure you if you want.

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.582
So, you're a doctor now.

01:49:15.208 --> 01:49:16.707
I am all in one.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.332
Want to see a miracle.

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:27.374
Soaring around on the
bike isn't called miracle.

01:49:27.583 --> 01:49:28.582
I see.

01:49:30.833 --> 01:49:31.915
Here we go.

01:50:19.375 --> 01:50:22.999
Krishna Vasudev Yadav, from Gokul.

01:50:26.916 --> 01:50:28.290
Do you believe now?

01:50:36.708 --> 01:50:39.874
"You're my mother, and my father."

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:43.499
"You're my friend,
and my companion."

01:50:43.958 --> 01:50:46.040
I've donned the same
form you always see..

01:50:46.125 --> 01:50:50.415
..on televisions,
calendars, movies.

01:50:50.875 --> 01:50:52.957
I've been seen in
this form for ages.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.832
And l'm standing before
you in that same form.

01:50:57.583 --> 01:51:01.165
But Kanji bhai, I'm not like that.

01:51:03.416 --> 01:51:04.540
You really..

01:51:06.125 --> 01:51:09.124
Forgive me, forgive me.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.707
Just like a devotee is
incomplete without his God..

01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:19.207
..similarly, God is incomplete
without his true devotee.

01:51:25.916 --> 01:51:28.374
Why didn't you show me
this miracle before?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.290
That's the problem.

01:51:35.375 --> 01:51:36.374
Friend.

01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:39.915
I am Krishna,
that's why I perform miracles.

01:51:41.583 --> 01:51:45.165
I'm not Krishna,
because l perform miracles.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.249
That means you're real.

01:51:49.083 --> 01:51:50.374
God exists.

01:51:50.958 --> 01:51:54.832
And God isn't my father-figure,
he's my friend.

01:51:54.916 --> 01:51:59.874
I am everyone's friend,
but no one understands me one.

01:52:00.166 --> 01:52:01.874
People gave you a high position.

01:52:02.208 --> 01:52:03.749
And you staggered.

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:07.457
Yes, but I am not
like people think of me.

01:52:08.708 --> 01:52:10.082
I've common sense too.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.999
I am not interested
in people's offerings.

01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:19.332
I want them to
distribute all this to the poor.

01:52:20.041 --> 01:52:24.832
All l care about is their faith,
their love, their belief.

01:52:24.916 --> 01:52:26.165
Just a minute.

01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:27.957
Belief?

01:52:28.458 --> 01:52:30.249
But I never believed in You.

01:52:30.875 --> 01:52:32.207
I was an atheist.

01:52:32.833 --> 01:52:34.499
Why did You show
yourself to only me?

01:52:35.333 --> 01:52:36.582
Kanji bhai, sit down.

01:52:43.958 --> 01:52:45.332
Do you know what atheist means?

01:52:47.375 --> 01:52:50.040
Someone who examines, thinks,
understands..

01:52:50.125 --> 01:52:51.749
..and says that this is wrong.

01:52:52.125 --> 01:52:53.249
The Lord doesn't exist.

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:55.582
He's an atheist.

01:52:55.875 --> 01:52:57.415
That's why I appeared before you.

01:52:57.958 --> 01:53:00.874
Because you did
everything a true atheist does.

01:53:01.125 --> 01:53:04.707
And a true atheist can
become a real believer.

01:53:05.333 --> 01:53:07.915
People come to me for
their own self-interest.

01:53:08.666 --> 01:53:10.915
They come with
different exchange offers.

01:53:11.166 --> 01:53:12.457
Exchange offer?

01:53:13.125 --> 01:53:14.999
"Lord, if I pass my SSC exams.."

01:53:15.041 --> 01:53:16.999
"..I will walk to
Siddhivinayak for 5 Tuesdays."

01:53:18.416 --> 01:53:22.582
"lf Dominic's agrees to marry me.."

01:53:23.125 --> 01:53:26.249
"..I will light 1 1 candles
at Mt. Mary."

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.749
"lf my wife gets pregnant.."

01:53:29.833 --> 01:53:32.124
"..then I will come and
offer a blanket at your shrine."

01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:34.165
Different offers.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.665
And those who can't
blame me for it.

01:53:39.375 --> 01:53:41.290
They say, we couldn't go there..

01:53:41.375 --> 01:53:43.082
..because the Lord didn't call us.

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:45.665
The Lord didn't call?

01:53:45.833 --> 01:53:46.999
Do they need a invitation card..
- Yes.

01:53:47.041 --> 01:53:48.624
Do you want me to write
you an invitation card?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.832
Don't l have anything better to do?

01:53:51.458 --> 01:53:54.249
And anyway, Kanji bhai,
I am present in every element.

01:53:54.708 --> 01:53:55.915
I am omnipresent.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.540
If you're present everywhere..

01:53:57.625 --> 01:53:59.082
..why have they built temples?

01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:01.082
I've my own house.

01:54:01.541 --> 01:54:03.749
I don't want to live
inside those four walls.

01:54:03.958 --> 01:54:06.957
Then? Why did you
create such a religion?

01:54:07.125 --> 01:54:09.290
I only created humans.

01:54:09.458 --> 01:54:12.540
And humans started religion, caste.

01:54:12.708 --> 01:54:14.790
And it's been going
on for years now..

01:54:14.875 --> 01:54:17.165
..because you need it.

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:19.332
But one should
discard such a religion.

01:54:20.916 --> 01:54:23.332
Never snatch the religion
from the people.

01:54:23.875 --> 01:54:28.624
If you take them away,
they will make you their religion.

01:54:30.708 --> 01:54:32.207
You don't believe it, do you?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.999
You've been in coma for a month.

01:54:39.916 --> 01:54:41.457
Let me show you what has happened..

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:43.124
..in the past one month.

01:54:44.208 --> 01:54:45.332
Look.

01:54:46.916 --> 01:54:49.957
Kanji Prabhu paid me
a visit in my dreams yesterday.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.540
And he said he's
the 1 1th Avatar of Lord Vishnu.

01:54:55.625 --> 01:54:56.915
What's going on?

01:54:58.166 --> 01:55:01.499
Kanji Prabhu appeared
in his four-armed form.

01:55:02.583 --> 01:55:05.957
Holding the mace, the conch..

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:09.124
People all around the world..

01:55:11.166 --> 01:55:12.790
I was on night duty.

01:55:12.875 --> 01:55:14.499
A just closed my eyes.

01:55:14.583 --> 01:55:16.957
And someone slapped me.

01:55:17.125 --> 01:55:20.624
And that's when I heard a voice,
"No sleeping on duty".

01:55:20.708 --> 01:55:23.457
Circulate a few miraculous
stories of Kanji in the market..

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:25.707
..and people will
spread it like wildfire.

01:55:26.208 --> 01:55:30.457
I had seen Kanji Prabhu
flying with his scooter.

01:55:30.541 --> 01:55:32.040
He appeared suddenly.

01:55:32.291 --> 01:55:34.290
10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet.

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.874
Brother Kanji is God.

01:55:36.125 --> 01:55:37.124
He is God.

01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:41.040
The 'dharma gurus' have accepted
Kanji bhai's Kalki avatar..

01:55:41.125 --> 01:55:43.165
..asked for an
apology and have decided..

01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:45.915
..to pay the claims
worth 400 crore.

01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:50.207
It was His will that we
should pay, so we did.

01:55:50.291 --> 01:55:52.040
But why are you making him God?

01:55:52.125 --> 01:55:53.665
Who told you that he is God?

01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:57.749
Do you know...when you will die?

01:55:58.666 --> 01:56:00.290
Do you?
- No.

01:56:00.875 --> 01:56:02.582
I don't know either.

01:56:03.875 --> 01:56:08.707
But he has decided his death day.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.957
On 16th December as soon as
we switch off the ventilator..

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.499
..Kanji's story will be over.

01:56:16.041 --> 01:56:18.249
But this time we've
incurred heavy losses.

01:56:18.833 --> 01:56:20.624
400 crores in insurance claims.

01:56:20.708 --> 01:56:21.957
One crore to the doctor.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.957
And the expense to
construct the temple.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.124
It's a onetime investment,
Mr. Mishra.

01:56:26.208 --> 01:56:28.415
We'll recover it in a year.

01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:34.124
And anyway, we haven't had
a new God for a long time now.

01:56:38.083 --> 01:56:46.624
"Hail Lord Kanji Wala."

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.499
"Om Lord Kanji Wala."

01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:56.874
"Sugar's high,
feeling breathless too."

01:56:57.083 --> 01:57:01.415
"Cure my swine flu."
- Cure my swine flu.

01:57:02.333 --> 01:57:05.207
I am going.
- Mahadev, wait.

01:57:05.291 --> 01:57:07.165
Where are you going so hastily?

01:57:07.333 --> 01:57:08.665
Forsake your anger.

01:57:09.125 --> 01:57:11.707
The bed besides
Kanji bhai is empty.

01:57:13.125 --> 01:57:14.665
Do you want me to
reserve that for you?

01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:19.957
He will forsake his
body on his birthday.

01:57:21.916 --> 01:57:27.249
His shrine will be built
right where his shop was.

01:57:27.416 --> 01:57:29.415
That isn't all. Now watch this.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.790
All arrangements to transport
Kanji bhai's tomb has been made.

01:57:32.958 --> 01:57:34.665
You snatched their business..

01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:36.915
..and they made you their business.

01:57:37.458 --> 01:57:38.290
Yes.

01:57:38.375 --> 01:57:41.415
Kanji bhai,
they've made an estimate..

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:46.082
..to earn 450 crores
from your temple.

01:57:46.416 --> 01:57:49.165
You're God, you
should've stopped them.

01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:51.999
Friend, l would've ended the
battle of Mahabharat in a second..

01:57:52.041 --> 01:57:53.374
..if l had picked up the weapon.

01:57:53.458 --> 01:57:54.832
But that isn't my job.

01:57:55.083 --> 01:57:58.124
My job is to show
people right and wrong.

01:57:58.375 --> 01:58:00.124
This is your temple, your battle.

01:58:00.208 --> 01:58:02.165
You decide what you should do.

01:58:02.458 --> 01:58:06.040
Fight if you want to,
or stay quiet.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.540
Save him, please doctor.

01:58:18.625 --> 01:58:20.290
We cannot do anything now.

01:58:20.875 --> 01:58:23.499
And anyway, it's his last wish.

01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:25.874
He is God.

01:58:27.583 --> 01:58:28.957
Just a minute.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.415
Wait here, we'll
bring the dead body out.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.957
Donate as much as you wish in the donation
box kept in front of Kanji Prabhu..

01:58:41.041 --> 01:58:43.165
..and have your wishes fulfilled.

01:58:45.541 --> 01:58:49.082
The rate for VIP line is Rs. 101.

01:58:49.166 --> 01:58:51.374
Welcome, welcome, Mahadev.

01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:55.624
Swami, our very own Mahadeveshwar.

01:58:56.625 --> 01:58:58.457
This is called destiny.

01:58:58.625 --> 01:59:03.207
Kanji's chapter's going to
end right where it started.

01:59:14.708 --> 01:59:16.999
Kanji bhai's body has gone
missing from the hospital.

01:59:17.458 --> 01:59:20.624
The hospital
administration has no explanation.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.957
Offerings made in
clarified butter, only Rs.25.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.207
Where did Kanji disappear to?

01:59:28.333 --> 01:59:30.624
Call Mr. Mishra.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.082
There he is.

01:59:33.166 --> 01:59:35.249
He isn't Spiderman. Find him.

01:59:36.708 --> 01:59:39.374
I just found out. Don't worry.

01:59:39.458 --> 01:59:41.457
I am there. I'll do something.

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:47.624
Kanji Prabhu's dead body can arrive
in the truck anytime now. - Go on.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.582
Everyone please keep calm, everyone
will get a chance to behold him.

01:59:54.625 --> 01:59:56.999
photographs of Sri Kanji Prabhu.

01:59:57.083 --> 02:00:01.415
Kanji Prabhu's autobiography.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.540
You are a fool.

02:00:15.625 --> 02:00:17.332
I gave orders and you
set out to look for Kanji.

02:00:17.416 --> 02:00:18.707
Who do you think he is?

02:00:19.875 --> 02:00:21.249
Let's get out of here quietly,
otherwise..

02:00:21.333 --> 02:00:22.707
..the people won't spare us.

02:00:22.791 --> 02:00:23.915
Come on.

02:00:44.708 --> 02:00:46.332
Kanji is alive.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.332
Yes, I am alive.

02:00:56.833 --> 02:00:58.415
What are you staring at?

02:00:58.916 --> 02:01:02.999
I am the same Kanji whom
you've turned into God.

02:01:03.708 --> 02:01:06.290
I don't know whether
you're great or fool.

02:01:06.875 --> 02:01:10.457
I kept telling you don't
turn religion into business..

02:01:10.541 --> 02:01:14.499
..you made him God and
started your business.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.624
Tell me one thing.

02:01:17.708 --> 02:01:21.749
The world's so beautiful, why
should God live only in temples?

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.165
I say, have faith in Him.

02:01:25.625 --> 02:01:28.165
Believe in Him from your heart
and you will find God.

02:01:28.916 --> 02:01:31.582
Try to find God in humans,
and you will find Him.

02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:33.540
You will find Him in humans.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.624
Not in these stones.

02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:39.540
Not in these...stones.

02:01:48.875 --> 02:01:51.165
They played with our emotions.

02:01:51.250 --> 02:01:53.665
We won't spare them!

02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:55.374
They spread the rumour
of your death as well.

02:01:55.458 --> 02:01:56.999
They are the imposters.

02:01:57.083 --> 02:01:58.665
Listen.

02:01:59.208 --> 02:02:02.165
You kill two and there
are two hundred more.

02:02:02.333 --> 02:02:04.124
Don't you see it on
television everyday?

02:02:04.291 --> 02:02:06.582
Their real punishment is..

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.040
..let them leave respectfully.

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:13.499
Let them leave in
their expensive cars.

02:02:13.583 --> 02:02:19.082
And no one will set foot in
their temples or hermitages.

02:02:19.375 --> 02:02:20.374
Get that.

02:02:20.791 --> 02:02:22.832
That will be their real punishment.

02:02:23.875 --> 02:02:25.165
Please leave.

02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:58.124
Faith and belief, are
very addictive, Kanji.

02:02:59.583 --> 02:03:04.040
Once you're addicted to it,
you cannot let go easily.

02:03:04.833 --> 02:03:06.749
All the people that you see here..

02:03:07.875 --> 02:03:12.665
..they are not God-loving people,
they are God-fearing.

02:03:13.375 --> 02:03:17.415
Sooner or later, you might
see them in hermitages again.

02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:22.374
Be fearless!

02:03:33.625 --> 02:03:37.374
So...won't you go along?

02:03:38.833 --> 02:03:40.415
Come on, break the idol.

02:03:41.666 --> 02:03:43.499
Papa.
- Where? Where is he?

02:03:43.583 --> 02:03:48.790
I want you to promise that no
one will ever drop a penny..

02:03:48.875 --> 02:03:50.415
..at any of the religious places.

02:03:55.583 --> 02:03:56.874
What are you staring at?

02:03:56.958 --> 02:03:58.415
Break the statue.

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:16.665
Here, come here.
- Come, I'll introduce you to Krishna.

02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:19.249
What?
- Come that way.

02:04:24.416 --> 02:04:26.665
Look, Kanji bhai,
they're felling the statue.

02:04:31.708 --> 02:04:33.624
It's exactly like you wanted.

02:04:34.916 --> 02:04:35.957
Look..

02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:57.457
Who are you looking for, Kanji?

02:05:00.291 --> 02:05:02.374
Didn't I say l am
present everywhere?

02:05:03.125 --> 02:05:05.207
I am pouring on fields as the rain.

02:05:06.125 --> 02:05:08.540
And making nests
along with the birds.

02:05:09.291 --> 02:05:12.040
I am also taking lunch
with the ants down there.

02:05:19.166 --> 02:05:20.749
Are you fine?
- Papa.

02:05:21.333 --> 02:05:22.582
Yes, I am fine.

02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:24.540
Whom did you want
us to introduce to?

02:05:28.250 --> 02:05:31.040
No one.

02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:35.290
What are you doing, Kanji?

02:05:36.041 --> 02:05:38.415
Don't wear this around
your neck as a talisman.

02:05:39.375 --> 02:05:41.999
You finally succeeded
in explaining people..

02:05:42.083 --> 02:05:43.582
..that this is wrong.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.999
Throw it.

02:05:45.958 --> 02:05:47.124
Throw it away.
