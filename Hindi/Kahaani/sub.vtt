00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.250

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:54.125
Please don't touch any unidentified objects.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:03.791
Please inform the Metro Police on finding..

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:07.791
..any unidentified object.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:25.666
Station Taliganj...

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.375
The doors are closing.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.458
Hello.

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.208
Yes, I am on the train.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:39.583
Which bag?

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.458
Next station.. - Speak louder.

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:42.375
Which bag?

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:43.041
Hello.

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:45.291
Platform on the right hand side.

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:46.666
Next station Rabindra Sadan.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:50.666
Platform on the right hand side.

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.000
Why is she crying so much?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.750
She's hungry. - Why don't you feed her?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.875
I forgot her feeding bottle at home.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.458
Yesterday I bought a new game, Call Of Duty: Black Ops.

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:16.583
What a game.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:17.541
Great graphics.

00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.500
Look, there's Kushal.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.125
Let's see what he has brought in the bag today.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.083
Kushal, why are you so scared.

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:28.333
Give it. Give the bag.

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:29.583
Why are you scared?

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:30.916
What are you hiding in your bag?

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:34.375
Is it something special?

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:35.250
Why are you scared?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.791
What are you hiding in your bag?

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.000
Give the bag. Give the bag.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.000
What are you hiding in your bag?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.250
I will go back home.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.250
Come on.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.000
Come on, let's go.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.000
Show me the bag.

00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.083
Hey, you left your bag behind.

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:03.083
The feeding bottle is right here.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:33.750
Don't push.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.166
More than 100 are expected to be dead..

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.583
..in Kolkata Metro Rail due to the deadly gas attack.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:39.416
Its believed that a terrorist group..

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:40.333
..is behind this attack.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.375
Abir, come and have a look at this.

00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:43.541
The Metro. What has happened?

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:45.083
The Metro. What has happened?

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:46.833
When did this happen?

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:47.791
Even on the third day passengers..

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:53.125
..are hesitating to travel by the Metro.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:54.875
The relatives of those..

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.458
..who died in the gas attack staged a rally in Kolkata today.

00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.458
And requested the government..

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.458
..to find out who is behind this attack.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:06.416
Madam.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.625
Madam. Madam. Come with me.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.833
Madam... this way...

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:23.041
Who are you?

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.916
What do you want? - Move, move.

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:25.583
What is going on?

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:26.791
I don't want anything. - Move, move.

00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:27.833
No, thank you.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:28.833
Taxi private.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:30.833
Madam. - Don't touch the bag.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:32.375
Get lost.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.166
You shouldn't lift heavy objects in such a condition.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:35.625
I don't want to go anywhere, thank you.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:36.625
Let me, let me. - Leave it.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:37.541
I have a kid too.

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:39.333
I have a kid too.

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.208
I've taken the luggage.

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.291
Let me, madam. Please.

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.083
Move aside. Move. - Please.

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:46.250
Madam, please come with me.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.625
Please come.. - Please move.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.625
Move aside. Leave.

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:14.750
Don't mind, madam.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.250
But can I ask you something?

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.875
I have been driving a taxi for the past 15 years.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.791
Every customer either goes home or to the hotel..

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:22.000
..from the airport.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.208
You are the first customer..

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:27.875
..who is directly going to the police station.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:31.083
Get the tea quickly.

00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:36.125
Press any key.

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:40.125
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:45.625
Here it is. - It's here.

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:47.875
Finally, it's here. - Its gone again.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.458
What happened now?

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.916
That's what his wife must be saying every night.

00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.916
Sign here.

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:10.875
"Can't live without you."

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:16.291
"Can't live without you."

00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:23.375
"Without you..."

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:29.375
"...there's no peace."

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.416
"I feel out of breath."

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:37.541
Madam, here's the police station.

00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:41.541
How much?

00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:51.875
Here's your bag.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:56.166
Madam, this is my number.

00:10:56.666 --> 00:11:00.166
If you ever need a taxi, call me. - Thank you.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.083
Where do I go to file a missing person's report?

00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:12.500
Yes, you go.. I...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.875
Just go straight..

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:17.208
I mean, it's just straight ahead. - Thank you

00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:19.958
Ma'am, ma'am, shall I carry this? - Thanks.

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:23.625
It's okay.

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:27.625
My husband is missing.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:36.041
Are you from out of town? - London.

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.541
You arrived just now? - Yes.

00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.583
Madam.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:46.500
We will need some details.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.583
Actually, a month ago.. - Tea.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:53.833
Will you have tea? - No.
117
00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:54.208
Yes, go ahead.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:57.125
He came to Kolkata a month ago.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.541
He had a two week assignment..

00:11:59.041 --> 00:12:00.000
..in the National Data Centre. - Okay.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.791
First two weeks we would talk every day.

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.666
Then he suddenly stopped calling.

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.333
No messages or anything.

00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:07.666
And I didn't know what to do.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:08.958
So I came here directly.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.958
I.. - Tell me slowly.

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:13.458
Doesn't my time have any value?

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.291
Speak softly, mister.

00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:18.500
Speak softly and I will hear you too.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.583
Your name.

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:21.083
Vidya Bagchi.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:22.208
Bidya Bagchi.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:25.583
No, it's Vidya. With a V.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:30.291
Madam, in Kolkata Vidya, Bidya are all the same.

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.791
Isn't it, Rana? - What?

00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:36.250
Vidya, Bidya are all the same, isn't it?

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.833
Your husband's name?

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:42.208
Arnab. - Bagchi?

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:44.125
Arnab..

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:47.916
It's bothering me. Stop this thing.

00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:48.625
Sorry.

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:52.250
And age? - 33.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.375
Complexion. - Wheatish.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:58.458
Height? - A little taller than that.

00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.458
5'11?

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.833
Do you have a photograph? - Yes.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:06.458
Doesn't my case have any value?

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:07.666
Doesn't my case have any value? - Softly. Softly.

00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:09.416
What softly? - You will speak softly..

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:10.500
..or else I will throw you out.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.500
He is listening to what you are saying.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.375
Love marriage.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:26.166
Is this a year old? - No, two years.

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:29.583
Don't you have a latest one?

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:33.583
No...Arnab didn't like to get his pictures taken.

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:36.125
'Isn't it enough that we runaway and got married?'

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:37.041
'Now we have to get a picture taken as well.'

00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:40.750
'Come here. Otherwise what's the evidence that you married me?'

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.458
It was the day we got married..

00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.000
..so I forced him to get our picture taken. - I see.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.125
What does your husband do?

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:48.750
We both were software engineers.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.291
Firewall experts. - Firewall..

00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:56.291
We make programs to save computers from virus attacks.

00:13:56.791 --> 00:14:00.250
Like, the police...protects the public.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.041
Right?

00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:02.500
Get this done quickly.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.166
Arnab was supposed to come to London..

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:06.750
..after the assignment, but he didn't.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.166
He suddenly disappeared. - Disappeared?

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:12.208
Yes, I mean no messages, no calls.

00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:14.125
And Arnab isn't like that.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.125
Where was he staying here?

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.250
Yes.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.083
Mona Lisa, 172A - Sarat Bose Road.

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:23.416
The place where he worked..

00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:24.500
..what did you say the name.. - National Data Centre.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.541
Yes. - But they said that..

00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:28.250
..Arnab never came there for any assignment.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.000
He did, I know.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.208
We talked every day.

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:34.708
He would call me a thousand times in a day..

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.083
..and I would scold him.

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.583
So that he doesn't spend his entire earning on the phone bill.

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:43.375
But I don't know why they are lying.

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:45.041
The case is slightly complicated.

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:46.291
I will do my best.

00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:47.041
It will be done.

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.083
It will take some time.

00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:52.041
I will get it done.

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:54.625
Madam, you will need to sign this.

00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.083
Sign, sign.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:58.708
Why are you after that thing?

00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:00.416
Leave it.

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:01.875
May I help?

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:06.125
You? - Oh yes, you are a computer..

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.708
Take a look.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:13.708
You don't pay any..

00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:19.291
You just needed to clear some memory.

00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:21.541
You won't face any problem now.

00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.375
Are you satisfied now?

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:24.375
Now, madam, you just need to sign..

00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:28.083
..and you're free to go.

00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:29.125
What happened, madam?

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.958
Sit, sit.

00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:35.125
Would you like some water?

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:38.166
Will you call a taxi for me, please? - Why, Taxi?

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.125
Rana will drop you.

00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:42.708
Rana, go drop her. Go.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:46.708
Come.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:01.625
How much further? - Its close-by.

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:09.791
Are you feeling better now?

00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:13.791
Is this your first visit to Kolkata? - Yes.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.666
Entire Kolkata is getting ready for the Puja (veneration), right.

00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:24.000
So you know about 'Durga Puja'?

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.791
My husband's a Bengali, so I will know that much.

00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:30.833
By the way, your name..

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.125
..is also a very common Bengali name.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.958
Vidya. - I know.

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.458
Courtesy Mr. Chatterjee.

00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.625
By the way, why do they call you Rana?

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.625
Your name.. The nametag reads Satyaki.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.416
In Kolkata everyone has two names.

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:48.750
One is 'Dak' name, which is pet name..

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.833
..like mine is Rana.

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:52.791
And the other is 'Bhalo' name, official name.

00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:54.000
Satyaki.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.250
But everyone addresses me by my pet name.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.583
Interesting. Two names of the same person.

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:05.791
Two identities.

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.791
Satyaki. Arjun's charioteer.

00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:16.916
Guesthouse?

00:17:17.416 --> 00:17:18.541
Is the hotel here?

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.541
Mrs. Bagchi, this doesn't seem like a hotel.

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.333
Are you sure this is the place?

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:42.541
That's the address.

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:45.625
Why would your husband stay here?

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.083
I don't know.

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:51.083
Come.

00:18:10.666 --> 00:18:12.041
Coming.

00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:14.583
Good evening. Are you the manager here?

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:15.583
Yes.

00:18:16.083 --> 00:18:16.291
Yes?

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:18.833
I am Vidya Bagchi. I had called you from London..

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.250
..about my husband Arnab. - Yes, yes.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.083
Arnab Bagchi.

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:25.666
Your Majesty, you.. - Look, I am not a queen.

00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:27.375
You can call me Vidya.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:30.583
Bidya madam, when you called from London..

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:34.375
..I told you that your husband wasn't staying here.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:35.958
The situation is still the same.

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:38.250
Arnab.. - You've been saying that all the while..

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.666
..and that's exactly why I came here.

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:41.916
I know this because he would talk to me everyday..

00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:43.083
..from right here.

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:45.500
Sir, please explain to her.. - Wait, wait.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.333
Mrs. Bagchi, maybe there's a confusion.

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:49.083
There's absolutely no confusion.

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:50.250
Arnab was staying here.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.291
This man is lying.

00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:52.541
Show me your records.

00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:56.541
Register. Get the register.

00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:00.791
This.

00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:02.708
Are these your records? - Yes.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.625
Don't you have a computer?

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:05.625
Computer?

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:08.166
Madam, only 5-star hotels have computers.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:09.541
This is a guesthouse.

00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:13.500
0-star.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.916
Arnab stayed here and I can prove that.

00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:17.750
If you walk towards the lift..

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.041
..there's a peacock statue there.

00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:20.041
Arnab used to say that..

00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:22.708
.."The peacock of Tamil Nadu has followed me here too".

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:26.125
Which way is the lift? - That way.

00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:27.416
Is it or not? - There is.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:28.791
Then? - There's a peacock.

00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:30.916
Please. - But your husband isn't here.

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:31.708
I mean, he wasn't.

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:33.166
Are you joking with me?

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:34.833
The peacock's really there.

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:37.000
But how do you know? - Exactly.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.250
If Arnab didn't tell me about it, then how do I know?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.500
I don't know why everyone's lying.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.958
What, sir?

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:45.416
Talk to me.

00:19:45.916 --> 00:19:47.125
Arnab wasn't staying here, right?

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:48.166
But I will.

00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:49.500
I will stay in room no.15.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.916
Mrs. Bagchi, are you sure.

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.500
I am absolutely sure.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.500
Will you give me the key?

00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.416
Sign here.

00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:04.416
Here?

00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.833
'Why are you standing at the door?'

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:05.250
'You took so long.'

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.416
'I've been waiting for so long..

00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.166
..even your phone was unreachable.'

00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:11.500
'And what if I hadn't returned?'

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.500
'Then I would've waited right here.'

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.208
It started raining heavily. - Business is down.

00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:47.833
Absolutely.

00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:48.458
Exactly.

00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:49.208
Right.

00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:51.083
Your.. No.

00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:54.666
Good morning, Bidya madam. - Its Vidya, not Bidya.

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:57.875
V, not B. - Whatever you say, Bidya madam.

00:23:58.375 --> 00:23:59.791
There's no hot water in the room. - I know.

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.708
You.. You know.

00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:05.625
Then why did you put up a board saying 'Running hot-water'.

00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:06.625
That?

00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:07.916
I tell you.

00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:09.375
Bishnu. Bishnu.

00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:10.833
Come here. Come here.

00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:12.708
Come.

00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:14.541
Madam, he's Bishnu.

00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:17.208
If you want hot water then call Bishnu.

00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:19.083
He will come running with the hot water.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:23.375
Running hot water is Bishnu.

00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:26.541
Okay, how to travel to Camel Street?

00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:28.333
You will get a bus, or a taxi outside

00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:31.166
Bishnu, show madam. - Come, sister.

00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:32.958
What is that? - Don't ask for that.

00:24:33.458 --> 00:24:34.541
That's his radio. His life.

00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:36.375
He will never give it.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:37.666
Come on.

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:39.250
You called me sister, didn't you?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.791
So then you're my brother.

00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:44.791
Give me a five, brother.

00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:11.250
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.916
Please call Mrs. Bagchi.

00:25:13.416 --> 00:25:14.541
Madam left for Camac street.

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:17.458
Hi. I am here to meet Agnes D'mello.

00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.541
Do you have an appointment? - Yes.

00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:22.166
Your name, madam. - Vidya Bagchi.

00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:23.833
Bidya Bagchi.

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:26.875
Oh, God.

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:29.833
Nothing.

00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:33.833
Bidya Bagchi.

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:46.000
Darling, I told you this when I called from London.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.958
Your husband didn't come to my company..

00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:51.041
..for any assignment.

00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:53.166
I am the HR manager.

00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:56.333
I approve every assignment.

00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:59.041
And I didn't sanction any assignment..

00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:03.041
..for any Arnab Bagchi.

00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:08.541
Arnab.

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:11.666
No. He didn't come here. - He did.

00:26:12.166 --> 00:26:13.125
I sent him.

00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.791
'I don't want to go to Kolkata.'

00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:17.166
'I am on a holiday.'

00:26:17.666 --> 00:26:19.750
'It's just a question of two weeks, I'll be okay.'

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.458
'Crying like a child.'

00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:26.916
'You are actually packing my bag.'

00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:29.458
'Baby, please. They will find someone else.'

00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:32.041
'And I will stay right here and look after you.'

00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:35.458
'Cooking, washing.'

00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:37.708
'That's what I am afraid of.'

00:26:38.208 --> 00:26:41.708
'I will be okay, go.'

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.708
Please help me.

00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:51.666
Please help me.

00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:53.541
I don't know what to do.

00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:54.291
Ma'am.

00:26:54.791 --> 00:26:57.541
Yes. - There's a police officer who wants to see you.

00:26:58.041 --> 00:27:01.541
Me?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.416
Bye. - Bye.

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:10.416
Poor girl.

00:28:21.791 --> 00:28:25.291
Mrs. Bagchi. This way.

00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:40.583
Show it.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.541
Let it be.

00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:53.541
Mrs. Bagchi.

00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:08.958
That wasn't Arnab.

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:15.458
Mrs. Bagchi, doesn't Arnab have any relatives in Kolkata?

00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:21.458
Uncle or anyone?

00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:22.916
He has an uncle.

00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:26.916
He stays in Thakurpukur.

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.083
That's the one...

00:29:46.583 --> 00:29:48.041
Meaning.

00:29:48.541 --> 00:29:49.958
Arnab's school.

00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:52.458
Kalagachhia Kailash Kamini High School.

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:56.208
I see. - I have heard lot of stories about it.

00:29:56.708 --> 00:29:57.000
Rana.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.958
That means uncle's house must be close-by.

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:03.958
Maybe. Let's go that way.

00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.041
Rana. I should've worn a sari, right?

00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:21.875
Just hold this. - Sari.

00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:23.250
You wear a sari as well.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.250
Do you have one?

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.083
Don't worry, Mrs. Bagchi. You are looking nice.

00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:30.375
Come.

00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:33.416
I am meeting them for the first time. - I know

00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:35.666
Arnab Bagchi. - No.

00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.583
Then, does any other Bagchi family live around here?

00:30:39.083 --> 00:30:41.291
Look, madam. We've been living here for the past 30 years.

00:30:41.791 --> 00:30:43.708
But we never heard of any Bagchi family..

00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:50.458
..or any Arnab Bagchi.

00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:51.125
Thank you.

00:30:51.625 --> 00:30:55.125
Who is Arnab Bagchi? - Thank you.

00:30:57.958 --> 00:31:01.458
Can you come in, please?

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:09.833
What happened? Been punished?

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:12.625
What is this? - This is a flying swan.

00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:14.875
I see, that's a flying swan. - Yes.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:16.958
It looks more like a dead duck to me.

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:20.958
Okay, see you.

00:31:30.125 --> 00:31:34.250
No, dear. There was no Arnab Bagchi that year.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.916
Why can't I access Milan Damji's record?

00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:38.458
Its showing me "Restricted" each time.

00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:41.500
Madam, I will need Mr. Tyagi's permission to unlock it

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.500
Where is Tyagi? - He's on leave today.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.750
Coming, mother.

00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:41.083
Hello.

00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:42.416
Agnes. - Yes.

00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:45.000
Hi. - Can you meet me tomorrow?

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.041
Of course. - At 3 o'clock.

00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:49.875
Where? - There's a restaurant at Park Street.

00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:52.250
Mocambo. - Mocambo.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.125
See you. - Take care.

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:57.125
Bye.

00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:15.375
Bishnu.

00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:20.125
Bishnu! - Coming, sister.

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:24.625
Hey you...where are you?

00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:28.625
Watch it. - Move aside.

00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:32.083
Here you go.

00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:36.083
Radio.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.250
Kalighat.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.458
Just a minute.

00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:45.958
Rana. Call from the airport.

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:46.333
Hello.

00:33:46.833 --> 00:33:48.333
Better explain that Bidya Bagchi.

00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:48.875
Yes, yes, yes.

00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:50.833
That Arnab or whoever..

00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:52.375
He got her pregnant and ran away.

00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:53.083
That's often the case.

00:33:53.583 --> 00:33:53.958
Hello.

00:33:54.458 --> 00:33:55.875
Tell her not to waste time here in this condition..

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:57.458
..and return to London.

00:33:57.958 --> 00:33:59.541
Oh, so you checked.

00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:01.416
I have been thinking about it for the past 30 years.

00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:04.625
But he ran away in 2 years. - I see.

00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:06.666
Sorry, will you say it again.

00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:09.250
Would you like a cup of tea, sir? - No, its fine.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.958
Thank you.

00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:16.458
Hi.

00:34:16.958 --> 00:34:18.666
Mr. Das. - Good morning, madam.

00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:20.458
Good afternoon, Mr. Das. - Whatever you say, madam.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:24.250
Good afternoon, Rana. - Good afternoon.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.958
Radio.

00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:28.458
Are you going anywhere? - To meet Agnes.

00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:29.916
I will drop you there.

00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:32.083
I won't need your chariot today, Satyaki.

00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:34.708
My taxi is waiting.

00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:38.250
Okay.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.833
Mrs. Bagchi, we checked..

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:43.250
..with Kolkata and London's immigration departments.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.625
The date that you told us..

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.791
..no Arnab Bagchi left from London..

00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.666
..or arrived in Kolkata.

00:34:51.166 --> 00:34:53.375
Then surely there's a mistake in the system.

00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:54.375
We double-checked it.

00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:55.666
Triple-checked it.

00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:59.666
That's the truth.

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:08.875
Thank you.

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:20.708
Yesterday after you left..

00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:22.791
..I took a close look at the photo.

00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:23.833
And you know what.

00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:27.083
Your husband's face resembles..

00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:28.750
..an ex-employ of ours.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.916
Milan Damji. - Who?

00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.166
Milan Damji.

00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:34.833
Two years ago he left office.

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.291
He was a funny one.

00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:37.750
He would stay silent.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.166
He joined suddenly and even left suddenly.

00:35:41.666 --> 00:35:42.916
His blood group was funny as well.

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:44.791
Bombay blood group.

00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:48.375
I clearly remember the day he left the company.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:51.375
A lot of people came looking for him.

00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:52.625
He disappeared.

00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:53.583
Poof.

00:35:54.083 --> 00:35:56.416
But what is the connection with Arnab?

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:57.875
Two years ago he was in London.

00:35:58.375 --> 00:36:01.416
Milan Damji looks just like Arnab.

00:36:01.916 --> 00:36:03.666
That's why yesterday I tried..

00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:06.500
..to get the file from the computer.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.500
But it would always show me the same message..

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.500
.."Restricted. Restricted. Restricted".

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.041
God knows how to operate these computers.

00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:18.250
Today when Tyagi returns.. - Tyagi?

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.250
Tyagi here.

00:36:24.958 --> 00:36:26.500
Who wants Milan Damji's records?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.625
If I can't access the computer..

00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.166
..then the employ records are in the old office.

00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:34.833
Maybe there's a photo in that.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:38.375
Agnes, thank you.

00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:39.958
But after seeing Milan's photo..

00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:42.416
Just see Milan Damji's photo once.

00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:46.416
Then decide on it.

00:36:58.041 --> 00:37:01.541
Bob.

00:37:03.208 --> 00:37:06.291
Bob. You can't do anything.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:07.791
The figures are so bad.

00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:10.250
You can't get a single life insurance client.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:15.541
If this goes on then soon you will be fired from this job.

00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:17.375
For God's sake, switch off the phone..

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.291
..and concentrate on your targets.

00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:23.291
Client, sir. - Disgusting.

00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:53.541
Yes. - Hello.

00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:54.458
Hello.

00:37:54.958 --> 00:37:56.916
Agnes D'Mello. - Yes.

00:37:57.416 --> 00:38:00.916
Just a minute

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:16.833
Oh, it was a wig.

00:38:46.041 --> 00:38:47.708
Good morning, sir.

00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:49.291
Sir, he's in a meeting.

00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:53.291
Gentlemen, we've to ensure that we do this.

00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:01.791
Excuse me.

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:07.833
I've to go to Kolkata today, right now. - Why?

00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:10.958
No smoking inside the building, Khan. - I know.

00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:14.875
Someone shot NDC's HR manager. - So.

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:16.958
That's the local police station's case.

00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:19.291
Why do you have to go to Kolkata for that?

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:23.291
She was trying to access Milan's record.

00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:26.916
What other information do you have?

00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:29.750
There's a pregnant lady, from London.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.291
Vidya Bagchi.

00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:37.375
Listen, on the sixth day.. - I need this room empty..

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:38.500
..for a while.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.750
Everyone go out.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.083
What?

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:45.083
Didn't you hear?

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:50.833
I need this room empty. - Who are you?

00:39:51.333 --> 00:39:51.583
What is your name?

00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:54.458
Get out. - What the.. Khan.

00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:58.166
That's my name What the.. Khan.

00:39:58.666 --> 00:39:59.541
Anything else?

00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:00.541
No, sir.

00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:02.083
Call Vidya Bagchi. - Yes.

00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:04.166
I want her here in 10 minutes.

00:40:04.666 --> 00:40:08.166
Okay, sir.

00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:11.916
Tell me.

00:40:12.416 --> 00:40:13.750
I am a pregnant woman, sir.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.833
You shouldn't be smoking in front of me.

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.875
Mrs. Bagchi, we don't know much about each other.

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:23.000
So leave it to me about what I should or shouldn't do.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.625
Let's come to the point.

00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:26.083
Tell me.

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:28.666
How are you related to Agnes?

00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:34.583
My husband Arnab Bagchi is missing.

00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:35.041
What happened?

00:40:35.541 --> 00:40:35.916
Why is everyone outside?

00:40:36.416 --> 00:40:38.500
That Vidya Bagchi, it's a big problem. - Really?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.458
Yes. - What are you saying?

00:40:42.958 --> 00:40:44.166
Mrs. Bagchi.

00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:45.583
What is going on?

00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:47.083
Look.. - Who are you?

00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:48.666
Look, I am talking to her. - Out.

00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:52.666
But who are you? - Out.

00:40:55.708 --> 00:40:58.375
Close the door behind you.

00:40:58.875 --> 00:41:01.958
Out!

00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:05.958
Yes, so what were you saying?

00:41:07.833 --> 00:41:08.583
Who is he?

00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:12.583
Arnab's face resembles her ex-employ Milan Damji.

00:41:13.083 --> 00:41:14.458
And Agnes.. - There was never an employee..

00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:16.416
..called Milan there.

00:41:16.916 --> 00:41:19.541
I feel Agnes doesn't know anything.

00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:21.791
Are you sure?

00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:23.541
Because I remember correctly..

00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:26.583
..that Agnes said Milan Damji.

00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:30.916
Mrs. Bagchi, I know more about NDC..

00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:33.000
..than you and Agnes.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.208
2000 employees work there, understand?

00:41:38.708 --> 00:41:39.750
I am quite sure.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.041
Yes, she also said that..

00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:45.750
..when she tried to access Milan Damji's record..

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.041
..she was getting "Restricted".. - You aren't listening to me.

00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:52.041
Are you listening?

00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:56.541
There was no one called Milan. - No, it's just that..

00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:58.916
..I am sure Agnes said Milan.

00:41:59.416 --> 00:41:59.791
..what I am saying?

00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:01.291
Do you understand..

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:04.666
You are still stuck on Milan.

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:06.416
Don't you understand what I am saying?

00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:08.500
"Milan. Milan. Milan."

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.500
Out!

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.083
Look, I..

00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:22.833
Mrs. Bagchi. Look here.

00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:26.125
I am giving you a free advice, although I don't.

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:27.541
Get over with whatever you came here to do..

00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:29.583
..and leave for London.

00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:31.958
That will be best for you in this condition.

00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:36.125
Do you understand?

00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.750
Mr. Khan.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.083
We don't know each other..

00:42:41.583 --> 00:42:47.791
..so leave it to me about what I should or shouldn't do.

00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:51.083
And anyway, you don't give free advices, don't you?

00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:53.000
That's good.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.291
You shouldn't either.

00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:56.541
Quiet.

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.541
Sir, sorry.

00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:02.541
Take all this inside.

00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:04.500
Mrs. Bagchi, I will drop you.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.125
Come.

00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:08.375
No, no, no. No need to worry, sir.

00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:10.250
It's a simple case.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.083
Actually.

00:43:14.583 --> 00:43:19.958
Agnes confused her husband with Milan.

00:43:20.458 --> 00:43:21.333
That Vidya Bagchi.

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:24.333
Her husband got her pregnant and disappeared.

00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:27.666
No, no, it's completely harmless.

00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:28.875
I will get her background checked.

00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:30.083
Don't worry at all.

00:43:30.583 --> 00:43:33.875
Don't waste time on that pregnant woman, Khan.

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:37.875
Tell me about Milan.

00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:47.166
Give me Captain Bajpayee.

00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:49.458
Yes.

00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:52.375
For God's sake get a mobile, Bajpayee. - Why?

00:43:52.875 --> 00:43:53.833
Why do I need a mobile?

00:43:54.333 --> 00:43:55.666
I stay at home the entire day.

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:59.250
When...can you come to the office? - Why?

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.625
I needed to discuss something important with you..

00:44:04.125 --> 00:44:07.041
..about Milan Damji.

00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:09.333
Hello.

00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:11.916
Bajpayee. - I am right here, go on.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:15.916
Can you come to the office? - No.

00:44:31.583 --> 00:44:34.125
Rana. If I address someone by his first name..

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:36.166
..then what does it mean?

00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:39.791
That you know him really well.

00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.583
'There's no one called Milan there.'

00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:43.000
'Actually there is no Milan.'

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.958
'Milan. Milan. Milan.'

00:44:45.458 --> 00:44:46.750
According to Khan, Milan Damji is someone..

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.083
..who doesn't exist at all.

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:52.708
Yet, he said Milan instead of Milan Damji.

00:44:53.208 --> 00:44:55.458
Why?

00:44:55.958 --> 00:44:56.916
I am going to NDC.

00:44:57.416 --> 00:45:02.375
If I find out anything, I will call you.

00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:05.666
No, sir. There is no Milan Damji in our records.

00:45:06.166 --> 00:45:10.333
How long have you been working here? - Sir, 1 years.

00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:14.333
And you never heard the name of Milan Damji? - No, sir.

00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:17.041
Sapna, do you..

00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:18.333
You?

00:45:18.833 --> 00:45:22.541
Sir, he was inquiring about Agnes D'Mello's murder case.

00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:25.708
Do you have any authorization?

00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:27.333
I am standing right behind you?

00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:30.083
Whose name is Rana?

00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:33.250
Sir. I am Rana.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.208
Why did you go there?

00:45:34.708 --> 00:45:35.708
With whose permission?

00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:37.500
Without any permission, or a warrant.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.666
To hell with the warrant, first tell me..

00:45:40.166 --> 00:45:41.791
Why do you have to conduct a local investigation..

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:43.958
..when this is a IB case?

00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:45.541
Next time if I see you following up..

00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:47.541
..without my permission.

00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:49.291
Then you will be telling the traffic police..

00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.416
..about the traffic from the control room, understand.

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:55.500
No, sir, actually.. - Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.333
Will you work for the traffic control?

00:45:57.833 --> 00:45:59.500
Do you want to work for the traffic control?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Out.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.375
Who else?

00:46:02.875 --> 00:46:06.375
Do you? Out.

00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:11.000
What?

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.500
Didn't you understand what I said?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.500
Out.

00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:22.375
How long have you been doing service? - Six months, sir.

00:46:22.875 --> 00:46:24.833
Do you love your job?

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:28.833
Do you want to keep working? - Yes, sir.

00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:37.333
Here.

00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:43.333
Mrs. Bagchi, I think Khan sir is right.

00:46:43.833 --> 00:46:45.166
Agnes must be confused with someone.

00:46:45.666 --> 00:46:49.666
See, NDC has at least 2000 employees.. - Exactly, Rana.

00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:51.541
2000 employees work in NDC..

00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:55.250
..so why did Agnes take Milan Damji's name?

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.541
She wasn't wrong?

00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:58.916
And you know, Agnes never said anything..

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:02.916
..until she hadn't seen Arnab's photo properly.

00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:11.291
What happened?

00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:15.000
Why are those women wearing such a sari? - Them?

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500
The red and white sari.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.208
They wear it on any auspicious day.

00:47:19.708 --> 00:47:21.375
But why?

00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:23.458
'White sari with red border?'

00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:24.916
'Why should I wear that?'

00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:25.916
'Why? Why?'

00:47:26.416 --> 00:47:27.000
'It's traditional.'

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.666
'Everyone wears that on the last day of Durga Puja.'

00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:32.666
'Everyone, even men?'

00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:36.333
'I will surely get one when I go to Kolkata, Mrs. Bagchi.'

00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:39.500
'And trust me, even you will look awesome.'

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.833
'What?'

00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:45.416
Oh, God.

00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:48.791
'What?'

00:47:49.291 --> 00:47:51.166
'Mr. Vidya Bagchi, don't bore me.'

00:47:51.666 --> 00:47:55.625
'And drop this stupid idea of making me wear a sari.'

00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:59.625
'Just go to Kolkata quietly and come back quickly.'

00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:09.750
And then I forced him to go to Kolkata.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.291
He's an idiot as well.

00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.750
He came here.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.750
He had this bad habit of doing whatever I said.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.250
I am completely sure you will find Arnab.

00:48:42.458 --> 00:48:44.666
Can I say something, if you don't mind?

00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:48.041
That sari, the one that woman was wearing.

00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:52.041
The day you find Arnab, you can wear that sari.

00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:56.041
That will be the auspicious day for you.

00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:02.666
Arnab won't be found so easily.

00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:05.458
I will have to look for him.

00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:07.625
That's the point, Mrs. Bagchi.

00:49:08.125 --> 00:49:10.083
How will we look for him?

00:49:10.583 --> 00:49:12.208
Milan Damji does not exist.

00:49:12.708 --> 00:49:17.791
He's some story that you believe to be true.

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.291
Rana.

00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:20.916
Agnes said..

00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:23.583
'The employee records are in the old office.'

00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:27.791
'There might be a photo in it.'

00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:30.208
What are you saying?

00:49:30.708 --> 00:49:31.666
How can we barge inside someone's office?

00:49:32.166 --> 00:49:34.791
That too, the National Data Centre. - But it's closed down.

00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:36.000
Sapna. - Yes, sir.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.500
Do you have hard copies of the old employees?

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.583
No, sir. Everything's on the system.

00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:42.500
You sure? - Yes, sir.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.666
Sir.

00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:46.083
There might be some in the old office.

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:50.291
There's nothing here.

00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:51.000
Hello.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.000
Write down, third floor.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.458
Third floor. - 12 R.N. Mukherjee Road.

00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:03.750
It's the NDC old office.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:07.416
There's a file on Milan Damji.. - Who is Milan Damji?

00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:09.708
No one. Just do as I say.

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:14.625
Get the file. - Bob.

00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:19.583
Client. - Good.

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:23.583
Let's go.

00:50:32.666 --> 00:50:36.166
This one.

00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:41.041
Oh, God. That's a big lock. I can't do it.

00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:45.333
Rana. Open it. - How?

00:50:45.833 --> 00:50:48.958
Mrs. Bagchi, I am the police not a thief. - Really?

00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:52.583
Open it.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:53.500
This is great.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.125
The police is breaking and entering himself.

00:50:56.625 --> 00:51:00.125
Very good.

00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:30.291
There are millions of file here.

00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:34.291
How will we find it?

00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:39.458
This is not done.

00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:41.166
We'll have to look for the HR department.

00:51:41.666 --> 00:51:43.541
It's a big thing I got in here.

00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:45.250
Meaning?

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:49.250
I will explain that later.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.125
What's written here?

00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:57.125
That's Xerox.

00:52:03.916 --> 00:52:05.666
This door.

00:52:06.166 --> 00:52:08.000
Chief accounts.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.250
Nope.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.250
Rana. H.R.D.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.666
Look there.

00:52:38.166 --> 00:52:39.583
If it exists then it must be somewhere here..

00:52:40.083 --> 00:52:40.500
..or it doesn't exist.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.500
If Agnes has said it, then it must be here.

00:52:50.416 --> 00:52:52.291
DE. DH. DU.

00:52:52.791 --> 00:52:59.083
DS. DC. D...DH.

00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.166
DA.

00:53:01.666 --> 00:53:02.958
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up. Please.

00:53:03.458 --> 00:53:06.958
Just a minute, Rana.

00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:12.583
Milan Damji.

00:54:14.708 --> 00:54:16.958
There was no file on Milan Damji.

00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:18.500
Milan Damji exists.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.500
Who is Milan Damji?

00:54:25.041 --> 00:54:27.125
Where did you get this paper from?

00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:28.500
What difference does that make?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:29.500
Who is Milan Damji?

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.416
Is he your husband?

00:54:31.916 --> 00:54:33.291
Take a good look.

00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:34.791
Is he your husband?

00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:36.166
Take a look.

00:54:36.666 --> 00:54:38.041
No. - He isn't.

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:41.375
Then what difference does it make about who he is.

00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:42.375
Forget Milan Damji..

00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:44.625
..and I will forget where you got this paper from.

00:54:45.125 --> 00:54:45.916
End of matter.

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.041
Milan Damji isn't Arnab.

00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:49.666
But he does look like Arnab..

00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:52.916
..and if something has happened to my husband..

00:54:53.416 --> 00:54:54.833
..because of that, then it is very important for me to know..

00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:57.958
..who Milan Damji is.

00:54:58.458 --> 00:55:02.958
Either you tell me or you leave it to me.

00:55:03.458 --> 00:55:07.083
I will find the answer and come back to you.

00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:11.083
How will you find out?

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.125
I will go out and ask every person.

00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:22.166
Even if he's a common man on the streets, the police.

00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:25.458
Or the media?

00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:31.291
Someone will surely have an answer to this question.

00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:33.583
Sit down, Mrs. Bagchi.

00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:37.583
Sit down.

00:55:42.083 --> 00:55:42.666
Do you know anything about..

00:55:43.166 --> 00:55:46.500
..the attack on Kolkata Metro two years ago?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.125
Yes.

00:55:48.625 --> 00:55:50.875
Milan Damji was behind that attack.

00:55:51.375 --> 00:55:55.916
He's the prime suspect in this case.

00:55:56.416 --> 00:55:59.041
Then why doesn't anyone know about Milan Damji.

00:55:59.541 --> 00:56:03.166
Milan Damji doesn't exist for the world, that's why.

00:56:03.666 --> 00:56:04.750
He didn't exist for me either.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.125
Until the day I was given the task to catch him.

00:56:08.625 --> 00:56:10.541
But until then it was too late.

00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:12.750
Milan disappeared and so did all his reports.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.458
But how can anyone just disappear?

00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:16.458
It can be our agents.

00:56:16.958 --> 00:56:18.000
Milan was a government agent.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:18.583
He betrayed us.

00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:19.666
Joined hands with the enemy.

00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:22.250
We have been hiding this from the people.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.416
Not just that, there's someone in our system..

00:56:24.916 --> 00:56:27.375
..who is helping Milan.

00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:32.916
This is a dangerous game, Mrs. Bagchi.

00:56:33.416 --> 00:56:35.333
Those who want to keep Milan safe are very powerful people.

00:56:35.833 --> 00:56:39.333
They can do anything.

00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:48.125
Welcome to Metro Railway.

00:56:48.625 --> 00:56:51.250
Welcome to Metro Railway.

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.750
Welcome to Metro Railway.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:57.750
Hello, madam.

00:57:12.625 --> 00:57:15.791
Hello, madam.

00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:18.875
Madam. I am so sorry.

00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:20.375
It was a mistake

00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:21.708
Are you alright?

00:57:22.208 --> 00:57:23.500
I saved you today.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
My reflexes.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.083
What if I can't save you tomorrow?

00:57:26.583 --> 00:57:28.791
Oh, God. One shouldn't think like that.

00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:31.541
You and your child should stay safe.

00:57:32.041 --> 00:57:33.458
I will pray to God for that.

00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:36.041
I will pray to God for that.

00:57:36.541 --> 00:57:37.000
Madam.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.166
Madam. Kolkata, dangerous city.

00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:41.125
Right?

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:43.916
Anything can happen here at anytime.

00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:45.625
I am explaining her for her own good.

00:57:46.125 --> 00:57:47.041
Go back.

00:57:47.541 --> 00:57:50.000
Go back, madam. Go back.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:56.541
Very dangerous city, Kolkata.

00:57:57.041 --> 00:57:59.291
No.

00:57:59.791 --> 00:58:01.375
I don't want to come back.

00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:04.500
You can have your bureau, your system.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.791
One project.

00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:07.625
Just one project failed.

00:58:08.125 --> 00:58:10.000
That doesn't mean we shut down the bureau?

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.250
Shut down the system.. - Just one project?

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:15.375
How easily you can say that, Bhaskaran?

00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:16.208
"Just one project."

00:58:16.708 --> 00:58:18.875
You gave me this assignment, Bhaskaran.

00:58:19.375 --> 00:58:21.500
Choose three common people, train them..

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.375
..and make them the bureau's best agent.

00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:24.541
And what did I do?

00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:27.458
I created a monster.

00:58:27.958 --> 00:58:28.958
I found two good people..

00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:31.208
..but an animal like Milan Damji got trained as well.

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:35.166
And he joined hands with those he had to save us from.

00:58:35.666 --> 00:58:40.625
He killed the very civilians I trained him to protect.

00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:43.833
We will find Milan, you just come back.

00:58:44.333 --> 00:58:47.000
You cannot find Milan, Bhaskaran, that's the point.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.208
I trained him. You cannot find him.

00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:53.166
Only fools like you and me can be found..

00:58:53.666 --> 00:58:57.291
..who keep ranting "Our system is perfect".

00:58:57.791 --> 00:58:58.958
"Law has the upper hand."

00:58:59.458 --> 00:59:01.416
"There is no corruption in our system."

00:59:01.916 --> 00:59:04.625
"Everything is hunky-dory."

00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:07.291
Bhaskaran.

00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:11.250
One man helped Milan Damji to flee.

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:13.500
That man is still working in your bureau..

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.458
..right under your nose.

00:59:16.958 --> 00:59:20.458
The day you find him, that day I will come back.

00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:34.541
Rana, three things are possible.

00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:41.541
One...Arnab has left me and fled.

00:59:42.041 --> 00:59:46.208
Two...Arnab and Milan Damji are the same person.

00:59:46.708 --> 00:59:49.875
And third...Arnab looks just like Milan Damji..

00:59:50.375 --> 00:59:54.791
..and that's why Arnab's in trouble.

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:57.208
That must have happened.

00:59:57.708 --> 01:00:00.291
So you are saying that Arnab's, looks like him and so.. - I am sure.

01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:02.916
We will have to find Milan in order to find Arnab.

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:07.375
And the day we find Milan, we will find Arnab.

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:09.500
Mrs. Bagchi, how is that possible?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.791
How will we find someone..

01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:13.166
..we don't know anything about? - From his house.

01:00:13.666 --> 01:00:15.000
Meaning? - I mean Agnes's file..

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.000
..had Milan Damji's residential address.

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:37.416
How much further?

01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:41.416
Ten minutes.

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:58.583
Sorry.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.041
It must be somewhere around here?

01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:12.041
Which way is Vishambar Malik Lane.

01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:16.666
Mrs. Bagchi, this is Vishambar Malik Lane.

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:19.583
Sister, where is number 9. - This one.

01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:20.541
This one? - Yes.

01:01:21.041 --> 01:01:24.541
This is the one. Come.

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:29.958
Number nine. Come on.

01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:40.333
You can climb up, can you? - Yes. Let's go.

01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:42.041
Carefully.

01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:43.916
I don't know which one it is.

01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:46.166
There are no numbers.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:47.750
Hey...look, it's the police.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.708
What's wrong sir.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:51.250
Nothing's wrong.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:52.375
Where is number three?

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.000
But it's locked.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.041
Nothing, nothing.

01:01:56.541 --> 01:01:59.666
Come.

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:03.833
Here it is. - But it's locked.

01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:07.833
I see. Give it.

01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:12.500
The police is breaking and entering himself.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.500
You said so.

01:02:19.791 --> 01:02:23.291
Wait.

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:35.291
I wonder why anyone needed to lock this place.

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:36.833
There's nothing here.

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.000
And even if there was anything..

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.125
..then Khan must have taken it away .

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:43.083
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:02:43.583 --> 01:02:44.791
Mrs. Bagchi. - Yes.

01:02:45.291 --> 01:02:45.833
Let's go from here.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:47.666
There's nothing here.

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:51.666
Yes, let me take a look.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:00.500
Mrs. Bagchi, don't do that. - No, no, I am okay.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.916
I will surely find something.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.916
Let's look there.

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:21.958
Did you see, Rana, only flat no.3 didn't have a letter-box?

01:03:27.166 --> 01:03:27.875
Who is it?

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:31.875
Was there a letter for no.3? - There is one.

01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:52.083
There in no.9.

01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:52.833
Just a minute.

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.000
Poltu, come here.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:55.791
Where are you?

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.000
Rana, Milan used to order tea from here.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.583
Maybe they might know something.

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:01.666
But how do you know?

01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:04.500
You offered me tea in a similar glass in the police station.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:05.708
'Would you like some tea."

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:06.750
See what they are asking for.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.208
Remember, there were two similar glasses..

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:09.583
..at Milan's house. - Yes.

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:12.791
Now, there was no kitchen in Milan's home, so.. - Sister.

01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:13.833
Poltu.

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.583
Just a minute.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.125
Are you scared?

01:04:19.625 --> 01:04:21.125
He is my friend.

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:23.208
What is your name? - Poltu.

01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:25.625
Poltu? Pet name or real name?

01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:28.458
Pet name. Real name is Shubroto.

01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:31.791
Shubroto, no need to be scared.

01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:33.500
So tell me, do you remember anything..

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.541
..about the person in flat no.3?

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.791
Flat no.3? No.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:38.666
Anything.

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.375
I mean what kind of a person he was.

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:41.541
Short-tempered.

01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:46.500
Or would he smile each time you delivered tea.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.083
Would he say something? - No, he wouldn't say anything, but..

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.458
He would order only one type of tea.

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:58.166
And sometimes a second person would come to meet him.

01:04:58.666 --> 01:04:59.541
That's when he would order two teas.

01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:00.750
Yes, there was someone.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:02.583
Who was the other person?

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:04.875
He would always carry a suitcase.

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:07.083
And the edges were like gold.

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:10.083
Suitcase?

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:13.750
This big. - Briefcase.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:19.250
Oh, you look so handsome when you smile, Shubroto.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:23.333
You can win any child's heart so easily.

01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:26.125
I am completely sure. - What?

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:30.875
That you will be a great mother.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:31.625
What is this?

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:34.291
Donation bills. Nonsense.

01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:36.666
He said there's a letter from the bank.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.250
But this is a blood bank.

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:42.041
People's blood bank.

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:43.500
Bombay blood group.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.875
Rana, Agnes had said that Milan had a rare blood group.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:49.791
'Bombay blood group.'

01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:52.208
Sir, if any person has a rare blood group..

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.500
..then he stores his blood with us.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.125
So that if there's an emergency..

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.625
..then he can use his blood. - I see.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:02.500
When was blood required last in this case?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.500
Will you check it and tell us?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.583
Just a wait a minute, I will tell you. - Of course.

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.041
There was a requirement for this rare blood group..

01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.625
..on May 2008, 25th May.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.375
And we received a call from Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:21.375
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.666
Not a single paper.

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.333
No records, nothing.

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:29.958
Must be. It's been erased.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:32.958
Just like every other records of Milan.

01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:35.250
Mrs. Bagchi, this is dead end.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.916
Come on, Satyoki.

01:06:37.416 --> 01:06:38.166
There must be something somewhere.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:41.125
I am not going to accept defeat.

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:42.791
You have always helped me.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.791
I cannot go further without your help, really.

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:52.833
There's one man who can help us.

01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:56.833
He was once a police informer.

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:15.166
Sorry.

01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:19.166
Come.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:27.625
Careful. Careful.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:33.375
Are you fine?

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:37.375
Thank you.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.708
Brother, can you tell me where is Paras.

01:07:49.208 --> 01:07:49.791
Brother.

01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:54.666
There. There.

01:07:55.166 --> 01:07:58.541
Paras.

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:01.125
No. I have no connections with the police now.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:04.791
But, Paras, we just need a small information.

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:07.250
Look, whether the information is small or big.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:08.541
I don't give it anymore.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:11.583
Paras. Please.

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:13.291
Please leave.

01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:17.625
If someone spots us then it will mean trouble.

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:23.541
Brother Paras. I am searching for my husband.

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:26.250
I came from London in this condition all alone.

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:29.875
I just need an answer for my child..

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.416
..that what happened to his father.

01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:37.416
I cannot force you, but...please help us.

01:08:43.833 --> 01:08:44.166
Tell me.

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:48.666
Have you heard about Milan Damji? - Who?

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:52.041
Milan Damji. No.

01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:54.916
Two years ago, on 25th May..

01:08:55.416 --> 01:08:58.208
..Bombay blood group was required in Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:08:58.708 --> 01:08:59.333
What for?

01:08:59.833 --> 01:09:01.000
We just need to find that out.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:05.000
Can you do that?

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.875
Laundry, sister.

01:09:17.083 --> 01:09:17.583
Laundry, sister.

01:09:18.083 --> 01:09:21.583
I am not laundry sister, I am sister Bidya.

01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.625
Your transistor is giving chocolate.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:27.583
Such a big chocolate.

01:09:28.083 --> 01:09:29.583
So big.

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:30.833
Hello.

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:34.500
You did disturb me, I am in a important meeting.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.958
In the room with Vishnu.

01:09:38.458 --> 01:09:41.958
Really? When?

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.625
25th May, 2008.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.333
Two men had a meeting here.

01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:59.916
There was news about only two people's death until now.

01:10:00.416 --> 01:10:03.625
But it seems like there was a third person as well.

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:07.750
And the blood was ordered from Ekbalpur Nursing Home..

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:09.208
..for this third person.

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:11.250
So, was that third person Milan Damji?

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.708
I don't have anymore information.

01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:15.041
Paras. Paras.

01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:16.583
Just a minute.

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.416
You will find the rest of the information..

01:10:18.916 --> 01:10:21.791
..at Park Street Police Station or you can find Dr. Ganguly.

01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:25.791
That night he was on night duty.

01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:30.750
No record.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.833
I remember that it was a police case..

01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:35.833
..but I don't remember what exactly it was.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.125
It was two years ago. - Ready, sir.

01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:38.875
Yes, I will be there. - Okay.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:41.458
Give me a day, I will check and tell you.

01:10:41.958 --> 01:10:42.541
Thank you. - I need to go, I have a surgery.

01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:46.541
Thank you.

01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:56.125
Don't worry. - Okay.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:57.166
Please. - Thank you, thank you.

01:10:57.666 --> 01:11:01.166
Thank you very much.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.041
Yes.

01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:16.000
Dr. Ganguly? - Yes.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.541
Hello. Bob Biswas.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:19.500
Hello.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.500
Just a minute.

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:30.541
'I remember that it was a police case.'

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:32.000
Stop it Rana.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.541
The commotion outside and then this.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.333
Mr. Chatterjee. - What?

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:39.416
Hello. - Oh my, God.

01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:40.250
Bidya Bagchi.

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.041
You arrived at the right time. - Hi, Rana.

01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:44.708
You had shut this computer up the other day, didn't you? - Yes.

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:45.791
Do it today as well, please, - Sure.

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.416
Otherwise I will go crazy.

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:48.250
Thank you.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:51.625
I will go meet the senior officer.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:52.333
Come, come.

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:53.541
Oh, God.

01:11:54.041 --> 01:11:54.625
No, no, keep seated.

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:58.625
He can return any moment.

01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:01.416
Two people were killed at Nonakpur Tram Depot..

01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:02.833
..on the 25th of May.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:04.416
One was Dinesh Rao..

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:07.625
..who was a police informer in the Metro attack case.

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:11.291
And second..

01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:14.666
Second was Vijay Verma who was a government agent.

01:12:15.166 --> 01:12:18.666
Government agent?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.583
He's back, he's back.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:24.708
It's done, sir.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:27.208
Done, Mr. Chatterjee. - Its, done.

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:29.125
That's nice, very good.

01:12:29.625 --> 01:12:29.958
Thank you, thank you.

01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:31.250
Thank you. - Welcome.

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.166
Okay.

01:12:34.666 --> 01:12:35.208
What is the matter?

01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:39.416
Mr. Chatterjee, may I leave? - Yes.

01:12:39.916 --> 01:12:40.041
Bye.

01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:44.041
Bye.

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:21.083
Yes, mother.

01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:25.083
I am coming.

01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:52.625
Mrs. Bagchi, what are you doing?

01:13:53.125 --> 01:13:53.958
Why are you cleaning it yourself?

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:55.375
Wait, I will call the staff? - No. no, no, no.

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:56.458
Come here.

01:13:56.958 --> 01:13:58.208
I do the cleaning myself at home.

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:01.208
Sit. I cannot tolerate dust.

01:14:01.708 --> 01:14:02.500
Pull a chair.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.250
Speak, Satyoki Sinha.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:07.291
Mrs. Bagchi, I pursued the information..

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:08.250
..acquired from the database.

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.791
There is no mention of a third person in the records

01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:14.208
Dr. Ganguly, Milan Damji, Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:16.500
No one knows anything about it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.500
There are records of Vijay and Dinesh.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.625
Vijay Verma was investigating the Metro attack..

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.000
..at ground level. - Really?

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:30.041
That's why he met Dinesh Raut at Nonakpur Tram Depot.

01:14:30.541 --> 01:14:32.541
Maybe Dinesh wanted to tell Vijay..

01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:35.083
..something about Milan.

01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:38.583
And someone informed Milan about it.

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:43.875
Milan killed both of them and got injured in the shootout.

01:14:44.375 --> 01:14:46.541
But the question is that how did Milan know..

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:49.375
..that Vijay is going to receive information about him?

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:51.541
Maybe Khan was right.

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:53.041
There is someone within the system..

01:14:53.541 --> 01:14:54.625
..who is helping Milan.

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.291
One more thing.

01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.333
NDC is also involved in this. - Really?

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:01.625
Mrs. Bagchi, every agent has a local, a fake identity.

01:15:02.125 --> 01:15:03.041
Just like Milan Damji..

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.541
..even Vijay Verma worked for NDC.

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:09.541
To hide his true identity.

01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:14.916
It must be him, take a good look.

01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:17.416
No. it wasn't him.

01:15:17.916 --> 01:15:19.750
Now, now, take a look. - No, sister.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:21.791
That wasn't him.

01:15:22.291 --> 01:15:23.083
It's not him. - Are you sure?

01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:25.125
Sure.

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:26.666
Come, let's take Poltu back.

01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:29.041
I was absolutely sure that..

01:15:29.541 --> 01:15:32.291
Tyagi knew that Agnes is looking for Milan's details.

01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:33.458
And Tyagi stopped you.

01:15:33.958 --> 01:15:34.625
Of course. - Sister.

01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:38.625
What? - The suitcase.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:47.208
It was him, sister.

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:50.708
Are you sure? - Sure, it was him.

01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:52.708
Who was he? - I don't know.

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:55.333
I suggest that you take Poltu home..

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:58.541
..until then I will find out, okay. - Yes.

01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:00.583
Good morning, sir.

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:03.541
Good morning, sir.

01:16:04.041 --> 01:16:07.541
Good morning.

01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:34.416
Turn around.

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:38.416
Turn around.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.041
Sister. - Yes.

01:16:57.541 --> 01:17:00.083
Will you have tea? - No.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:03.500
Listen, when Rana arrives will you ask him to call me.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:04.791
The police officer? - Yes.

01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.541
Okay. - Yes, fine.

01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:10.541
Bye.

01:17:39.958 --> 01:17:40.125
Sorry.

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:41.375
Rana.

01:17:41.875 --> 01:17:43.458
I was waiting for you at the tea-stall for so long..

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:47.458
Blood!

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:51.250
Oh no.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.458
Rana, that's him. He tried to kill me.

01:17:54.958 --> 01:17:58.458
Stop. I am the police.

01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:23.541
Stop.

01:18:24.041 --> 01:18:27.541
Move.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.000
Are you crazy?

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:54.250
Stop. I am the police.

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.625
Stop. Stop.

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:19.625
Stop.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.541
Oh, God.

01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:39.250
Mrs. Bagchi, Bob Biswas was a contract killer.

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:40.125
This is his phone.

01:19:40.625 --> 01:19:43.000
And I have found these photographs from his phone.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.000
Agnes Dmello.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.250
Dr. Ganguly.

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:48.625
And after that...you.

01:19:49.125 --> 01:19:49.625
This time you survived.

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.500
But the man who hired Bob..

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.541
..doesn't want anyone to reach Milan Damji..

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:56.250
I gave this photo to Agnes.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:00.250
Just a minute.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.166
Look.

01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:08.083
I gave a copy of this photo to Agnes.

01:20:08.583 --> 01:20:10.791
That means whoever gave Bob the contract is in NDC.

01:20:11.291 --> 01:20:15.083
No, no. It means you didn't hear whatever I said until now.

01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:16.791
And you don't understand, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:18.208
Your life is in danger.

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:19.416
And I will have to tell Mr. Khan about this.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.083
Did you find out whose briefcase that was? - Mrs. Bagchi..

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.000
Who was it?

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.291
He is Shridhar.

01:20:24.791 --> 01:20:25.333
The head of IT department.

01:20:25.833 --> 01:20:29.333
Tyagi reports to him.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:35.916
Rana, we thought that Tyagi is doing everything.

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:38.541
But Tyagi was only passing the information.

01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:41.291
We have no evidence about it.

01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:42.458
Come, let's go to the police.

01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:44.083
And yes, that phone is a evidence.

01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:45.291
Return it.

01:20:45.791 --> 01:20:47.250
Phone.

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:49.083
Rana. Rana. Look.

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:51.916
Bob has been sent this message from some website.

01:20:52.416 --> 01:20:53.833
So?

01:20:54.333 --> 01:20:55.541
Once I hack this website then I will know..

01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:57.791
..whose computer these photos were sent from.

01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:01.791
What, you..

01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:06.041
Are you a hacker? - Only in my spare time.

01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:10.041
You do know that I am the police, don't you?

01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:17.916
Yes, yes, yes.

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.833
Sorry.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.041
This is the IP of the computer..

01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:25.166
..from where the photos the photos were sent.

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:27.041
And I am completely sure..

01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:28.791
..this is the IP address of that Mr. Briefcase.

01:21:29.291 --> 01:21:30.166
And once that is confirmed..

01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:32.208
..then we can find Milan Damji. - No, no, no.

01:21:32.708 --> 01:21:33.041
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.833
This matter is very serious now.

01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:36.833
And I still say that we should go to the police.

01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:38.750
We don't have time, Rana.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.875
Mr. Briefcase will soon find out that Bob is dead..

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:43.833
..and then he will try to erase all the records.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:45.083
No, Mrs. Bagchi, I.. - Please.

01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:47.666
We should.. - We just have to access Shridhar's computer.

01:21:48.166 --> 01:21:50.041
After that we will go to the police.

01:21:50.541 --> 01:21:54.916
Cross my heart and hope to die.

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:59.375
You think death is a joke, Vidya?

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:02.375
Mrs. Bagchi, I have told you so many times..

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:05.791
..that your life is in danger.

01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:08.625
You even witnessed everything with your own eyes.

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:14.958
Even after that you are joking about death.

01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:18.625
Maybe because, after Arnab..

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:23.333
..life has become a joke, Rana.

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:27.333
Shall we?

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:41.083
Sapna. - Yes, sir.

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:42.833
You haven't left yet, Sapna.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.416
Sir, the office is closed due to the veneration tomorrow.

01:22:45.916 --> 01:22:48.958
So I was completing my work.

01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:52.625
It is very good to see someone working so hard.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:57.583
One day, when I get the time I will take you out.

01:22:58.083 --> 01:23:00.375
For coffee. - I would love that, sir.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.833
Bye.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:08.166
Good evening sir

01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:12.708
I am coming, darling.

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:15.125
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

01:23:15.625 --> 01:23:16.708
Why did you keep the visitor's book outside?

01:23:17.208 --> 01:23:20.708
Get the employer's book. - Sorry, sir.

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:26.291
Thank you.

01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:28.833
Come.

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:36.000
"Some day...somewhere."

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:41.708
"With this vagabond heart..."

01:23:42.208 --> 01:23:45.708
It's not opening.

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:51.375
Thank you.

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:52.333
"...we wander around.'

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:56.250
Thanks.

01:23:56.750 --> 01:24:00.250
Mrs. Bagchi, quickly do whatever you want to do

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Come on, pick up the phone.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.500
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up please. - Rana, just a minute.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.500
I am almost there.

01:24:49.791 --> 01:24:53.291
"With my vagabond heart..."

01:24:56.375 --> 01:24:59.750
Mrs. Bagchi, what is happening?

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.250
Sapna was right, there are many layers of protection.

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:06.250
It will take a little time.

01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:14.416
Mrs. Bagchi, why is it taking you so long to check an IP address?

01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:16.791
Rana. Rana. IP address.

01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:17.958
It's the same IP address.

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:22.833
Mr. Briefcase. We've nailed him. - Are you sure? - Of course.

01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:24.333
Guard! Guard!

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:26.125
Why are you sleeping? Get up. - Yes.

01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:30.375
Was someone here with Sapna madam? - A man and a woman.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:32.583
Oh no. Close all doors.

01:25:33.083 --> 01:25:36.583
Don't let anyone go out. - Yes, sir.

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:51.208
Did anyone come down? - No, sir.

01:25:55.791 --> 01:25:58.166
Yes, sir. - At the back, where people smoke cigarette..

01:25:58.666 --> 01:26:02.166
..is the door open? - Yes, sir.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.000
Come.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.000
We came out at the right time.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:49.166
Oh no.

01:26:49.666 --> 01:26:53.166
Mrs. Bagchi, come quickly.

01:26:56.666 --> 01:26:57.333
Hello.

01:26:57.833 --> 01:26:58.375
Yes. But he is following yes.

01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:02.041
What happened? Who are you calling?

01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:03.791
Please come quickly, sir. We need help.

01:27:04.291 --> 01:27:05.166
What happened?

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:07.666
I had to call Khan sir. - Khan?

01:27:08.166 --> 01:27:11.666
Sorry. Shridhar is right behind us.

01:27:23.458 --> 01:27:26.958
What did you take from my computer?

01:27:37.166 --> 01:27:37.958
Gun.

01:27:38.458 --> 01:27:41.958
Where is my gun?

01:27:51.208 --> 01:27:51.250
Come.

01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:52.916
Let's go, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:56.791
Rana, bag.

01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:59.083
Stop it. - Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:03.083
We want this man alive.

01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:12.875
No, no, no. this man can't die.

01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:13.791
Oh no.

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:16.541
We wanted this man alive.

01:28:17.041 --> 01:28:18.291
Why didn't you call me earlier?

01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:22.291
How will we catch Milan now?

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:29.500
How will we catch Milan without him?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.958
Take him to the hospital.

01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:37.291
Rana works for me.

01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:40.166
Mrs. Bagchi, do you remember what I said.

01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:43.750
We've been looking for Milan for the past two years

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:48.125
And we had this last option to find him.

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:51.041
You. You could do what we couldn't.

01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:55.375
But you ruined the entire plan.

01:28:55.875 --> 01:28:59.458
Actually, Mrs. Bagchi, there's someone in the organization..

01:28:59.958 --> 01:29:02.041
..who is helping Milan.

01:29:02.541 --> 01:29:06.000
Mr. Khan couldn't reopen the case himself.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.791
So he asked for my help.

01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:12.333
..so that we can find Milan through you.

01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:14.541
'Do you love your job? - Yes, sir.'

01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:18.541
'From today you will work for me.'

01:29:20.458 --> 01:29:21.333
Why me?

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:23.875
Because no one's scared of a pregnant woman.

01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:25.916
Especially, when her husband has run away.

01:29:26.416 --> 01:29:27.791
No one would've doubted.

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:32.458
But, Mrs. Bagchi, only because of you..

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:36.500
..we could find out that Milan is responsible for Vijay's death too.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.625
And we could reach Shridhar only because of you, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:49.333
You...were using me. - Yes.

01:29:49.833 --> 01:29:53.875
Your case was revived only because of me..

01:29:54.375 --> 01:29:55.958
..because Arnab looks just like Milan.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.916
But we don't have time for.. - And Agnes?

01:29:59.416 --> 01:30:01.625
Dr. Ganguly? - Collateral damage.

01:30:02.125 --> 01:30:03.458
One needs to make small sacrifices in big battles..

01:30:03.958 --> 01:30:04.541
..what's the big deal?

01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:06.875
And me? My child?

01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:10.125
Nothing would've happened to you.

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:11.583
I wouldn't have allowed it.

01:30:12.083 --> 01:30:15.583
I took up this assignment only because of you.

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:24.125
Mrs. Bagchi, we wanted Shridhar alive.

01:30:24.625 --> 01:30:25.791
He was the only one who could've lead us..

01:30:26.291 --> 01:30:28.625
..to the man who is helping Milan from within the system.

01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:29.916
Listen to me carefully.

01:30:30.416 --> 01:30:31.625
We have one last option.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:34.125
You have hacked Shridhar's computer.

01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:37.083
Do it again. We might find a clue.

01:30:37.583 --> 01:30:38.833
Why should I help you?

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:42.250
I am not asking for your help, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:43.291
I am telling you.

01:30:43.791 --> 01:30:47.291
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:22.583
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:25.791
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:26.291 --> 01:31:29.791
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:43.541
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:47.875
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:54.666
"Walk alone."

01:31:55.166 --> 01:32:01.541
"Walk alone."

01:32:02.041 --> 01:32:04.166
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:32:04.666 --> 01:32:07.416
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:32:07.916 --> 01:32:11.416
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:50.375
Bishnu!

01:33:05.416 --> 01:33:12.416
"If no one hears your call..."

01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:16.416
"Walk alone."

01:33:21.208 --> 01:33:27.125
"If no one hears your call..."

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:32.083
"Walk alone."

01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:36.083
"Walk alone."

01:33:54.541 --> 01:33:58.041
Mr. Khan.

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.041
This is the only code that I don't understand.

01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:06.458
Rest of the computer is clean.

01:34:06.958 --> 01:34:08.916
CXWWEDFXZS.

01:34:09.416 --> 01:34:12.916
Is that all you found?

01:34:36.041 --> 01:34:40.291
Rana. What happened?

01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:43.541
No. I don't know.

01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:47.541
What can it be?

01:34:51.708 --> 01:34:52.458
Give me your phone, sir.

01:34:52.958 --> 01:34:56.458
CXWWEDFXZS.

01:35:01.958 --> 01:35:05.458
Sir, I feel this is a mobile number.

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:12.416
This is Bhaskaran's number.

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:14.875
What the..

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:18.041
Mrs. Bagchi. You will have to do one last thing for me.

01:35:18.541 --> 01:35:21.666
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:35:22.166 --> 01:35:23.375
Are you listening?

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:27.375
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:30.250
Call Bhaskaran.

01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:31.375
And lie to him that..

01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:34.500
..you found some data about him on Shridhar's computer?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Why should I do that?

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.416
Because Bhaskaran is the last resort..

01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:42.416
..to find Arnab and Milan.

01:35:48.916 --> 01:35:51.791
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:55.708
I was harsh with you every time.

01:35:56.208 --> 01:35:59.708
This time it's a request, so..

01:36:04.916 --> 01:36:08.416
Please help me.

01:36:12.041 --> 01:36:13.916
Mr. Bhaskaran. - Yes.

01:36:14.416 --> 01:36:14.875
Who is this?

01:36:15.375 --> 01:36:16.958
This is Vidya Bagchi speaking.

01:36:17.458 --> 01:36:18.500
Where did you get my number from?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.916
From Shriddhar's computer.

01:36:21.416 --> 01:36:23.791
I have found some more papers in your name. - So?

01:36:24.291 --> 01:36:28.500
Look, I don't care about who you are or what you do.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.541
I will return all your papers..

01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:35.208
..in return I want legal aid to help me find my husband.

01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:38.333
Look, I don't know why you are calling me.

01:36:38.833 --> 01:36:40.083
I will inform my local office.

01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:44.083
Contact him.

01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:56.958
Now?

01:37:02.916 --> 01:37:03.750
If you want to see your husband alive..

01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:07.750
..then wait for my call.

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:14.958
Milan Damji.

01:37:16.833 --> 01:37:21.500
Yes, I need a big brown envelope.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.500
Okay.

01:37:31.208 --> 01:37:34.708
Hello.

01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:49.750
How are you? - Fine.

01:37:53.375 --> 01:37:55.500
I had to make a promise.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.916
But before that, this is for you.

01:38:02.416 --> 01:38:05.916
Today's the last day of the veneration.

01:38:12.291 --> 01:38:14.958
I cannot take this. - No, no, no, Mrs. Bagchi, this..

01:38:15.458 --> 01:38:18.333
I still have the receipt.

01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:21.666
I wanted to promise you that..

01:38:22.166 --> 01:38:25.000
..I will help you in finding Arnab.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:31.500
And when we find him, I will make him pay for this sari.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.500
This is from Arnab, not me.

01:38:38.583 --> 01:38:40.250
I am sorry, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:44.250
I am really very sorry.

01:38:52.541 --> 01:38:56.541
Thank you.

01:38:57.041 --> 01:39:00.541
Sorry.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.333
Paras Pal.

01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:05.291
Yes, Paras.

01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:07.625
You were asking about Milan Damji, weren't you?

01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:09.041
Yes, did you find out anything?

01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:11.708
The news is that he has returned to Kolkata.

01:39:12.208 --> 01:39:14.791
Wow. Then Khan sir's plan is working.

01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:17.500
Only Milan can come see Vidya.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.458
Bhaskaran doesn't have any other option.

01:39:19.958 --> 01:39:21.791
Vidya? - Yes.

01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:24.291
As soon as Milan comes to see her, he will be caught.

01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:27.125
You want to sacrifice a helpless girl?

01:39:27.625 --> 01:39:29.208
No, no, no, this isn't my plan.

01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:30.708
This is Khan sir's plan.

01:39:31.208 --> 01:39:35.500
And Mrs. Bagchi..

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.375
Move.

01:39:36.875 --> 01:39:38.000
Call him up. - Sir, sir.

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:38.625
Sir, I am sorry.

01:39:39.125 --> 01:39:39.916
Just a minute. - I was saying..

01:39:40.416 --> 01:39:42.250
We will have to stop this operation at any cost, sir. - Yes.

01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:45.375
If Milan meets Mrs. Bagchi, then her life is in danger.

01:39:45.875 --> 01:39:47.000
So? - You didn't understand, sir.

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:48.583
Milan never leaves behind any eye-witness.

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:50.208
He will do the same this time as well.

01:39:50.708 --> 01:39:55.375
So, we will try to save your Mrs. Bagchi.

01:39:55.875 --> 01:39:57.083
You know, sir.

01:39:57.583 --> 01:40:00.041
You know, yet you are.. - Sacrificing her.

01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:01.375
This is wrong.

01:40:01.875 --> 01:40:02.791
You are intentionally.. - Shut up.

01:40:03.291 --> 01:40:04.666
You want to teach me right and wrong.

01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:06.416
My job is to protect the country..

01:40:06.916 --> 01:40:09.250
..and anything I do for that is right.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:12.958
If I have to sacrifice Vidya Bagchi to catch Milan Damji..

01:40:13.458 --> 01:40:13.833
..then that's right too.

01:40:14.333 --> 01:40:16.125
Then what is the difference between us and Milan, sir?

01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:18.500
There's no difference.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.125
We do it for the law and he does it against it.

01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:25.833
So we are right and he's wrong.

01:40:26.333 --> 01:40:27.375
Love is a good thing, Rana.

01:40:27.875 --> 01:40:29.791
But learn to use it at the right place.

01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:30.833
Meaning?

01:40:31.333 --> 01:40:35.875
Your love that's telling you "Go tell Vidya Bagchi about Khan".

01:40:36.375 --> 01:40:37.666
That's wrong.

01:40:38.166 --> 01:40:39.333
This way you can save only one life..

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:43.083
..but what about thousands of lives that Milan will take?

01:40:43.583 --> 01:40:45.000
I wasn't going to tell her, sir, but..

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.125
Rajveer, take his mobile.

01:40:47.625 --> 01:40:48.541
Don't let him go anywhere.

01:40:49.041 --> 01:40:51.250
Not even to the bathroom.

01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:55.000
No, sir. Nothing important.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:59.000
Yes, so what were you saying?

01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:00.958
Sister Bidya.

01:42:01.458 --> 01:42:05.500
Sister Bidya.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.500
Keep it.

01:42:20.875 --> 01:42:24.375
Sister.

01:42:43.875 --> 01:42:45.208
You are Sharma, aren't you? - Yes, why?

01:42:45.708 --> 01:42:46.250
Khan sir is calling you.

01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:49.875
Where? - In the AC.. OC chamber.

01:42:50.375 --> 01:42:51.208
You go.

01:42:51.708 --> 01:42:54.166
And he has asked me to sit here.

01:42:54.666 --> 01:42:58.166
I will keep a watch on him.

01:43:01.583 --> 01:43:03.291
Rana. Go.

01:43:03.791 --> 01:43:05.291
Go, go. - What about you?

01:43:05.791 --> 01:43:09.291
I will handle it here. Go. - Thank you, Chatterjee.

01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:12.708
Rana. - Yes.

01:43:13.208 --> 01:43:16.708
Where are you going? - I'll be right back.

01:43:26.208 --> 01:43:29.708
Hello.

01:43:31.375 --> 01:43:35.625
Triangular Park.

01:43:36.125 --> 01:43:37.000
Hello.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:38.625
Triangular Park. Triangular Park.

01:43:39.125 --> 01:43:40.583
Get lost.

01:43:41.083 --> 01:43:42.041
Sir, where is Rana? - To hell with him.

01:43:42.541 --> 01:43:43.958
Come on. - Okay, sir.

01:43:44.458 --> 01:43:45.250
Rajveer, follow us.

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:46.291
Come on, hurry up.

01:43:46.791 --> 01:43:50.291
Come on, come on, hurry up.

01:43:54.250 --> 01:43:54.916
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

01:43:55.416 --> 01:43:56.250
She paid her dues and left.

01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.333
Where did she go? - Sister went to Triangular Park.

01:43:58.833 --> 01:44:02.333
Triangular Park.

01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:28.333
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:46:33.333 --> 01:46:36.833
Take a left from here, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:47:02.291 --> 01:47:05.166
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:47:05.666 --> 01:47:09.041
Where are the files? - Who are you?

01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:11.416
What difference does it make?

01:47:11.916 --> 01:47:13.833
Files.

01:47:14.333 --> 01:47:18.708
Milan Damji...who was just a story until now.

01:47:19.208 --> 01:47:21.500
I have very little time, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.791
If you want your husband back... Files.

01:47:26.291 --> 01:47:27.875
If I return the papers then..

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:30.250
..will you return me my husband? - Yes.

01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:34.250
Files.

01:47:36.333 --> 01:47:38.708
Can you return him?

01:47:39.208 --> 01:47:42.708
Think about it.

01:49:57.291 --> 01:49:59.291
Who are you?

01:49:59.791 --> 01:50:03.291
What difference does it make?

01:50:14.583 --> 01:50:18.083
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

01:50:27.875 --> 01:50:29.083
Catch her.

01:50:29.583 --> 01:50:31.916
Check him. Check him.

01:50:32.416 --> 01:50:35.208
Catch her. She's wearing a white sari.

01:50:35.708 --> 01:50:36.750
I said she's wearing a white sari.

01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:40.750
Are you blind?

01:51:37.875 --> 01:51:38.875
Who was Mrs. Bagchi?

01:51:39.375 --> 01:51:44.166
Vidya Bagchi was a story, sir? - Meaning?

01:51:44.666 --> 01:51:44.875
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

01:51:45.375 --> 01:51:46.291
'Sister went to Triangular Park.'

01:51:46.791 --> 01:51:50.291
'Triangular Park.'

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:58.250
'This is a flying swan.'

01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:59.416
'Where did you find this uniform?'

01:51:59.916 --> 01:52:02.083
'This? It's my school uniform.'

01:52:02.583 --> 01:52:04.208
'Back when I lived in Thakurpukur.'

01:52:04.708 --> 01:52:07.541
'Any uncle. Anyone.'

01:52:08.041 --> 01:52:09.875
'He has an uncle, who lives in Thakurpukur.'

01:52:10.375 --> 01:52:11.375
'Did you ever tell sister Vidya about this?'

01:52:11.875 --> 01:52:13.625
'Yes, when we met for the first time.'

01:52:14.125 --> 01:52:17.625
'I have heard many stories about it.'

01:52:21.416 --> 01:52:22.875
Check her hotel room and her finger prints.

01:52:23.375 --> 01:52:24.208
It's of no use, sir.

01:52:24.708 --> 01:52:27.833
'Why are you cleaning it yourself?'

01:52:28.333 --> 01:52:28.541
What?

01:52:29.041 --> 01:52:30.833
'Just one sign and then you can leave.'

01:52:31.333 --> 01:52:33.291
'Sign here. - Here.'

01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:35.583
And her husband, Arnab?

01:52:36.083 --> 01:52:38.083
Oh, so you haven't understood yet, sir.

01:52:38.583 --> 01:52:38.666
What?

01:52:39.166 --> 01:52:40.666
'In the beginning, you told her a story.'

01:52:41.166 --> 01:52:42.500
'There was never anyone called Milan.'

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:43.458
Yes, so?

01:52:43.958 --> 01:52:45.333
And even she told us a story.

01:52:45.833 --> 01:52:47.000
'My husband is missing.'

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.000
'Arnab Bagchi didn't stay here.' - 'No, dear.'

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.041
'He didn't leave London or land in Kolkata.'

01:52:51.541 --> 01:52:52.541
Milan was for real, sir.

01:52:53.041 --> 01:52:56.000
But there is no Vidya Bagchi nor Arnab..

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:57.000
..who looks like Milan.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.583
'Arnab didn't like to get his picture taken.'

01:52:59.083 --> 01:53:00.458
'Until Agnes didn't see Arnab's photo properly.'

01:53:00.958 --> 01:53:04.500
'And the day we find Milan, we will find Arnab.'

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.125
What the..

01:53:08.625 --> 01:53:10.125
That means until now.. - Correct.

01:53:10.625 --> 01:53:12.583
She kept using us.

01:53:13.083 --> 01:53:14.791
Sir, it seems like Vidya Bagchi was hired..

01:53:15.291 --> 01:53:17.333
..to find and kill Milan Damji.

01:53:17.833 --> 01:53:20.500
And she used us to find Milan.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.166
She wanted us to use her as a scapegoat..

01:53:23.666 --> 01:53:25.208
..to find Milan Damji.

01:53:25.708 --> 01:53:27.416
And before we could arrest Shridhar.

01:53:27.916 --> 01:53:29.083
Vidya killed her as well.

01:53:29.583 --> 01:53:32.625
Sir, you gave Bhaskaran and Milan to her yourself.

01:53:33.125 --> 01:53:33.583
She knew.

01:53:34.083 --> 01:53:37.958
'No one doubts a pregnant woman.'

01:53:38.458 --> 01:53:41.958
You wanted evidence against Bhaskaran didn't you?

01:53:44.583 --> 01:53:45.750
'What did you take from my computer?'

01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:49.125
Here it is.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:51.166
Who is Satyoki?

01:53:51.666 --> 01:53:55.166
'Arjun's charioteer.'

01:53:57.583 --> 01:53:58.458
That's me, sir.

01:53:58.958 --> 01:54:01.541
My name is Satyoki.

01:54:02.041 --> 01:54:03.458
But who sent her?

01:54:03.958 --> 01:54:07.458
And why did she help us?

01:54:28.333 --> 01:54:31.833
Here.

01:54:35.791 --> 01:54:36.708
I don't want to go to Kolkata.

01:54:37.208 --> 01:54:38.125
Go.

01:54:38.625 --> 01:54:40.791
If I go to Kolkata, I'll get it for you too Mrs. Basu.

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:44.791
What?

01:54:46.333 --> 01:54:49.833
And what if I don't return.

01:54:56.541 --> 01:55:00.041
'Arup.'

01:55:02.041 --> 01:55:05.541
'Sorry, we couldn't save your child.'

01:55:13.833 --> 01:55:20.041
'Arup took up this assignment only because of me.'

01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:24.041
'It's completely my fault.'

01:55:44.041 --> 01:55:47.750
Arup must be really happy today, Vidya.

01:55:48.250 --> 01:55:51.791
He must be proud of you.

01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:54.500
Because today you have accomplished..

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.500
..what we all couldn't.

01:55:59.833 --> 01:56:02.708
You want to know a strange thing, Colonel.

01:56:03.208 --> 01:56:05.083
In the last few days..

01:56:05.583 --> 01:56:09.250
..I completely forgot that I am not pregnant.

01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:13.250
It felt like...my child is still alive inside me.

01:56:18.916 --> 01:56:22.416
It felt like...I might find Arup as well.

01:56:28.333 --> 01:56:31.416
I cannot live without them, Colonel.

01:56:31.916 --> 01:56:35.541
I want my Arup back.

01:56:36.041 --> 01:56:39.541
I want my child back.

01:56:51.708 --> 01:56:54.833
'Today, two years later.'

01:56:55.333 --> 01:56:58.166
'The family of those killed in the Metro attack..'

01:56:58.666 --> 01:57:02.166
'..have finally got an answer.'

01:57:07.541 --> 01:57:10.791
'Sometimes even God's make mistakes.'

01:57:11.291 --> 01:57:12.625
'Gods created demons.'

01:57:13.125 --> 01:57:14.958
'Bestowed them with power.'

01:57:15.458 --> 01:57:19.000
'But when they started abusing that power..

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.375
..Gods created Goddess Durga.'

01:57:22.875 --> 01:57:27.791
'To annihilate the demons.'

01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:31.375
'It's said that Goddess Durga..

01:57:31.875 --> 01:57:34.500
..was created by gathering the strength of all the Goddess's.'

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.916
'Every year the Goddess graces us with her presence.'

01:57:37.416 --> 01:57:39.541
'Eliminates evil.'

01:57:40.041 --> 01:57:43.541
'And goes back.'

01:57:51.375 --> 01:57:56.416
'So that all of us can live happily and peacefully..

01:57:56.916 --> 01:58:00.416
..without any fear.'

01:59:07.166 --> 01:59:14.875
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:59:15.375 --> 01:59:23.500
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:30.333
"Walk alone."

01:59:30.833 --> 01:59:34.875
"Walk alone."

01:59:35.375 --> 01:59:38.875
"Walk alone."

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:16.666
"If everyone stays aloof from you, and no one talks to you."

02:00:17.166 --> 02:00:22.125
"If everyone turns their back on you, and everyone fears you."

02:00:22.625 --> 02:00:26.125
"If everyone turns their back on you, and everyone fears you."

02:00:41.416 --> 02:00:46.250
"Speak your heart alone."

02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:50.250
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

02:01:36.208 --> 02:01:43.958
"If you're surrounded by a fog. And the darkness swallows the light."

02:01:44.458 --> 02:01:49.375
"When the world bows before a fear."

02:01:49.875 --> 02:01:54.875
"When the world bows before a fear."

02:01:55.375 --> 02:02:00.291
"Be the light..."

02:02:00.791 --> 02:02:06.166
"Be the light...that diminishes darkness."

02:02:06.666 --> 02:02:08.250
"Burn alone."

02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:13.500
"Be the light...that diminishes darkness. Burn alone."

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:21.625
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."
