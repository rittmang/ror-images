00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.250

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:54.125
Please don't touch any unidentified objects.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:03.791
Please inform the Metro Police on finding..

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:07.791
..any unidentified object.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:25.666
Station Taliganj...

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.375
The doors are closing.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.458
Hello.

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.208
Yes, I am on the train.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:39.583
Which bag?

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.458
Next station.. - Speak louder.

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:42.375
Which bag?

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:43.041
Hello.

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:45.291
Platform on the right hand side.

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:46.666
Next station Rabindra Sadan.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:50.666
Platform on the right hand side.

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.000
Why is she crying so much?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.750
She's hungry. - Why don't you feed her?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.875
I forgot her feeding bottle at home.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.458
Yesterday I bought a new game, 
Call Of Duty: Black Ops.

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:16.583
What a game.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:17.541
Great graphics.

00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.500
Look, there's Kushal.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.125
Let's see what he has brought in the bag today.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.083
Kushal, why are you so scared.

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:28.333
Give it. Give the bag.

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:29.583
Why are you scared?

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:30.916
What are you hiding in your bag?

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:34.375
Is it something special?

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:35.250
Why are you scared?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.791
What are you hiding in your bag?

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.000
Give the bag. Give the bag.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.000
What are you hiding in your bag?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.250
I will go back home.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.250
Come on.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.000
Come on, let's go.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.000
Show me the bag.

00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.083
Hey, you left your bag behind.

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:03.083
The feeding bottle is right here.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:33.750
Don't push.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.166
More than 100 are expected to be dead..

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.583
..in Kolkata Metro Rail due to the deadly gas attack.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:39.416
Its believed that a terrorist group..

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:40.333
..is behind this attack.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.375
Abir, come and have a look at this.

00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:43.541
The Metro. What has happened?

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:45.083
The Metro. What has happened?

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:46.833
When did this happen?

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:47.791
Even on the third day passengers..

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:53.125
..are hesitating to travel by the Metro.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:54.875
The relatives of those..

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.458
..who died in the gas attack staged a rally in Kolkata today.

00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.458
And requested the government..

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.458
..to find out who is behind this attack.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:06.416
Madam.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.625
Madam. Madam. Come with me.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.833
Madam... this way...

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:23.041
Who are you?

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.916
What do you want? - Move, move.

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:25.583
What is going on?

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:26.791
I don't want anything. - Move, move.

00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:27.833
No, thank you.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:28.833
Taxi private.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:30.833
Madam. - Don't touch the bag.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:32.375
Get lost.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.166
You shouldn't lift heavy objects in such a condition.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:35.625
I don't want to go anywhere, thank you.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:36.625
Let me, let me. - Leave it.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:37.541
I have a kid too.

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:39.333
I have a kid too.

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.208
I've taken the luggage.

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.291
Let me, madam. Please.

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.083
Move aside. Move. - Please.

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:46.250
Madam, please come with me.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.625
Please come.. - Please move.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.625
Move aside. Leave.

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:14.750
Don't mind, madam.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.250
But can I ask you something?

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.875
I have been driving a taxi for the past 15 years.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.791
Every customer either goes home or to the hotel..

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:22.000
..from the airport.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.208
You are the first customer..

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:27.875
..who is directly going to the police station.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:31.083
Get the tea quickly.

00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:36.125
Press any key.

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:40.125
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:45.625
Here it is. - It's here.

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:47.875
Finally, it's here. - Its gone again.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.458
What happened now?

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.916
That's what his wife must be saying every night.

00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.916
Sign here.

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:10.875
"Can't live without you."

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:16.291
"Can't live without you."

00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:23.375
"Without you..."

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:29.375
"...there's no peace."

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.416
"I feel out of breath."

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:37.541
Madam, here's the police station.

00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:41.541
How much?

00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:51.875
Here's your bag.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:56.166
Madam, this is my number.

00:10:56.666 --> 00:11:00.166
If you ever need a taxi, call me.
- Thank you.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.083
Where do I go to file a missing person's report?

00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:12.500
Yes, you go.. I...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.875
Just go straight..

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:17.208
I mean, it's just straight ahead.
- Thank you

00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:19.958
Ma'am, ma'am, shall I carry this? - Thanks.

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:23.625
It's okay.

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:27.625
My husband is missing.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:36.041
Are you from out of town? - London.

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.541
You arrived just now? - Yes.

00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.583
Madam.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:46.500
We will need some details.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.583
Actually, a month ago.. - Tea.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:53.833
Will you have tea? - No.
117

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:54.208
Yes, go ahead.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:57.125
He came to Kolkata a month ago.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.541
He had a two week assignment..

00:11:59.041 --> 00:12:00.000
..in the National Data Centre. - Okay.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.791
First two weeks we would talk every day.

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.666
Then he suddenly stopped calling.

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.333
No messages or anything.

00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:07.666
And I didn't know what to do.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:08.958
So I came here directly.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.958
I.. - Tell me slowly.

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:13.458
Doesn't my time have any value?

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.291
Speak softly, mister.

00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:18.500
Speak softly and I will hear you too.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.583
Your name.

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:21.083
Vidya Bagchi.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:22.208
Bidya Bagchi.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:25.583
No, it's Vidya. With a V.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:30.291
Madam, in Kolkata Vidya, Bidya are all the same.

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.791
Isn't it, Rana? - What?

00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:36.250
Vidya, Bidya are all the same, isn't it?

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.833
Your husband's name?

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:42.208
Arnab. - Bagchi?

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:44.125
Arnab..

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:47.916
It's bothering me. Stop this thing.

00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:48.625
Sorry.

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:52.250
And age? - 33.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.375
Complexion. - Wheatish.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:58.458
Height? - A little taller than that.

00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.458
5'11?

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.833
Do you have a photograph? - Yes.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:06.458
Doesn't my case have any value?

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:07.666
Doesn't my case have any value? 
- Softly. Softly.

00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:09.416
What softly? - You will speak softly..

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:10.500
..or else I will throw you out.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.500
He is listening to what you are saying.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.375
Love marriage.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:26.166
Is this a year old? - No, two years.

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:29.583
Don't you have a latest one?

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:33.583
No...Arnab didn't like to get his pictures taken.

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:36.125
'Isn't it enough that we runaway and got married?'

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:37.041
'Now we have to get a picture taken as well.'

00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:40.750
'Come here. Otherwise what's the evidence that you married me?'

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.458
It was the day we got married..

00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.000
..so I forced him to get our picture taken. 
- I see.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.125
What does your husband do?

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:48.750
We both were software engineers.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.291
Firewall experts. - Firewall..

00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:56.291
We make programs to save computers from virus attacks.

00:13:56.791 --> 00:14:00.250
Like, the police...protects the public.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.041
Right?

00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:02.500
Get this done quickly.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.166
Arnab was supposed to come to London..

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:06.750
..after the assignment, but he didn't.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.166
He suddenly disappeared. - Disappeared?

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:12.208
Yes, I mean no messages, no calls.

00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:14.125
And Arnab isn't like that.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.125
Where was he staying here?

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.250
Yes.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.083
Mona Lisa, 172A - Sarat Bose Road.

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:23.416
The place where he worked..

00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:24.500
..what did you say the name.. 
- National Data Centre.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.541
Yes. - But they said that..

00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:28.250
..Arnab never came there for any assignment.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.000
He did, I know.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.208
We talked every day.

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:34.708
He would call me a thousand times in a day..

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.083
..and I would scold him.

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.583
So that he doesn't spend his entire earning on the phone bill.

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:43.375
But I don't know why they are lying.

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:45.041
The case is slightly complicated.

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:46.291
I will do my best.

00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:47.041
It will be done.

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.083
It will take some time.

00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:52.041
I will get it done.

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:54.625
Madam, you will need to sign this.

00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.083
Sign, sign.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:58.708
Why are you after that thing?

00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:00.416
Leave it.

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:01.875
May I help?

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:06.125
You? - Oh yes, you are a computer..

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.708
Take a look.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:13.708
You don't pay any..

00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:19.291
You just needed to clear some memory.

00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:21.541
You won't face any problem now.

00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.375
Are you satisfied now?

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:24.375
Now, madam, you just need to sign..

00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:28.083
..and you're free to go.

00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:29.125
What happened, madam?

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.958
Sit, sit.

00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:35.125
Would you like some water?

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:38.166
Will you call a taxi for me, please? 
- Why, Taxi?

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.125
Rana will drop you.

00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:42.708
Rana, go drop her. Go.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:46.708
Come.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:01.625
How much further? - Its close-by.

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:09.791
Are you feeling better now?

00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:13.791
Is this your first visit to Kolkata? - Yes.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.666
Entire Kolkata is getting ready for the Puja (veneration), right?

00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:24.000
So you know about 'Durga Puja'?

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.791
My husband's a Bengali, so I
will know that much.

00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:30.833
By the way, your name..

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.125
..is also a very common Bengali name.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.958
Vidya. - I know.

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.458
Courtesy Mr. Chatterjee.

00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.625
By the way, why do they call you Rana?

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.625
Your name.. The nametag reads Satyaki.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.416
In Kolkata everyone has two names.

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:48.750
One is 'Dak' name, which is pet name..

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.833
..like mine is Rana.

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:52.791
And the other is 'Bhalo' name, official name.

00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:54.000
Satyaki.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.250
But everyone addresses me by my pet name.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.583
Interesting. Two names of the same person.

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:05.791
Two identities.

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.791
Satyaki. Arjun's charioteer.

00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:16.916
Guesthouse?

00:17:17.416 --> 00:17:18.541
Is the hotel here?

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.541
Mrs. Bagchi, this doesn't seem like a hotel.

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.333
Are you sure this is the place?

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:42.541
That's the address.

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:45.625
Why would your husband stay here?

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.083
I don't know.

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:51.083
Come.

00:18:10.666 --> 00:18:12.041
Coming.

00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:14.583
Good evening. Are you the manager here?

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:15.583
Yes.

00:18:16.083 --> 00:18:16.291
Yes?

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:18.833
I am Vidya Bagchi.
I had called you from London..

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.250
..about my husband Arnab. - Yes, yes.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.083
Arnab Bagchi.

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:25.666
Your Majesty, you..
- Look, I am not a queen.

00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:27.375
You can call me Vidya.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:30.583
Bidya madam, when you called from London..

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:34.375
..I told you that your husband wasn't staying here.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:35.958
The situation is still the same.

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:38.250
Arnab..
- You've been saying that all the while..

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.666
..and that's exactly why I came here.

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:41.916
I know this because he would talk to me everyday..

00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:43.083
..from right here.

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:45.500
Sir, please explain to her.. - Wait, wait.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.333
Mrs. Bagchi, maybe there's a confusion.

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:49.083
There's absolutely no confusion.

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:50.250
Arnab was staying here.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.291
This man is lying.

00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:52.541
Show me your records.

00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:56.541
Register. Get the register.

00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:00.791
This.

00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:02.708
Are these your records? - Yes.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.625
Don't you have a computer?

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:05.625
Computer?

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:08.166
Madam, only 5-star hotels have computers.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:09.541
This is a guesthouse.

00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:13.500
0-star.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.916
Arnab stayed here and I can prove that.

00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:17.750
If you walk towards the lift..

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.041
..there's a peacock statue there.

00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:20.041
Arnab used to say that..

00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:22.708
.."The peacock of Tamil Nadu has followed me here too".

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:26.125
Which way is the lift? - That way.

00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:27.416
Is it or not? - There is.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:28.791
Then? - There's a peacock.

00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:30.916
Please. - But your husband isn't here.

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:31.708
I mean, he wasn't.

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:33.166
Are you joking with me?

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:34.833
The peacock's really there.

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:37.000
But how do you know? - Exactly.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.250
If Arnab didn't tell me about it, then how do I know?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.500
I don't know why everyone's lying.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.958
What, sir?

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:45.416
Talk to me.

00:19:45.916 --> 00:19:47.125
Arnab wasn't staying here, right?

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:48.166
But I will.

00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:49.500
I will stay in room no.15.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.916
Mrs. Bagchi, are you sure.

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.500
I am absolutely sure.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.500
Will you give me the key?

00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.416
Sign here.

00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:04.416
Here?

00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.833
'Why are you standing at the door?'

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:05.250
'You took so long.'

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.416
'I've been waiting for so long..

00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.166
..even your phone was unreachable.'

00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:11.500
'And what if I hadn't returned?'

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.500
'Then I would've waited right here.'

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.208
It started raining heavily.
- Business is down.

00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:47.833
Absolutely.

00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:48.458
Exactly.

00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:49.208
Right.

00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:51.083
Your.. No.

00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:54.666
Good morning, Bidya madam.
- Its Vidya, not Bidya.

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:57.875
V, not B. - Whatever you say, Bidya madam.

00:23:58.375 --> 00:23:59.791
There's no hot water in the room. - I know.

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.708
You.. You know.

00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:05.625
Then why did you put up a board saying 'Running hot-water'.

00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:06.625
That?

00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:07.916
I tell you.

00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:09.375
Bishnu. Bishnu.

00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:10.833
Come here. Come here.

00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:12.708
Come.

00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:14.541
Madam, he's Bishnu.

00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:17.208
If you want hot water then call Bishnu.

00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:19.083
He will come running with the hot water.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:23.375
Running hot water is Bishnu.

00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:26.541
Okay, how to travel to Camel Street?

00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:28.333
You will get a bus, or a taxi outside

00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:31.166
Bishnu, show madam. - Come, sister.

00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:32.958
What is that? - Don't ask for that.

00:24:33.458 --> 00:24:34.541
That's his radio. His life.

00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:36.375
He will never give it.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:37.666
Come on.

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:39.250
You called me sister, didn't you?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.791
So then you're my brother.

00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:44.791
Give me a five, brother.

00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:11.250
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.916
Please call Mrs. Bagchi.

00:25:13.416 --> 00:25:14.541
Madam left for Camac street.

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:17.458
Hi. I am here to meet Agnes D'mello.

00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.541
Do you have an appointment? - Yes.

00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:22.166
Your name, madam. - Vidya Bagchi.

00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:23.833
Bidya Bagchi.

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:26.875
Oh, God.

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:29.833
Nothing.

00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:33.833
Bidya Bagchi.

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:46.000
Darling, I told you this when I called from London.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.958
Your husband didn't come to my company..

00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:51.041
..for any assignment.

00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:53.166
I am the HR manager.

00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:56.333
I approve every assignment.

00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:59.041
And I didn't sanction any assignment..

00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:03.041
..for any Arnab Bagchi.

00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:08.541
Arnab.

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:11.666
No. He didn't come here. - He did.

00:26:12.166 --> 00:26:13.125
I sent him.

00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.791
'I don't want to go to Kolkata.'

00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:17.166
'I am on a holiday.'

00:26:17.666 --> 00:26:19.750
'It's just a question of two weeks, I'll be okay.'

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.458
'Crying like a child.'

00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:26.916
'You are actually packing my bag.'

00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:29.458
'Baby, please. They will find someone else.'

00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:32.041
'And I will stay right here and look after you.'

00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:35.458
'Cooking, washing.'

00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:37.708
'That's what I am afraid of.'

00:26:38.208 --> 00:26:41.708
'I will be okay, go.'

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.708
Please help me.

00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:51.666
Please help me.

00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:53.541
I don't know what to do.

00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:54.291
Ma'am.

00:26:54.791 --> 00:26:57.541
Yes. - There's a police officer who wants to see you.

00:26:58.041 --> 00:27:01.541
Me?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.416
Bye. - Bye.

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:10.416
Poor girl.

00:28:21.791 --> 00:28:25.291
Mrs. Bagchi. This way.

00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:40.583
Show it.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.541
Let it be.

00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:53.541
Mrs. Bagchi.

00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:08.958
That wasn't Arnab.

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:15.458
Mrs. Bagchi, doesn't Arnab have any relatives in Kolkata?

00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:21.458
Uncle or anyone?

00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:22.916
He has an uncle.

00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:26.916
He stays in Thakurpukur.

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.083
That's the one...

00:29:46.583 --> 00:29:48.041
Meaning.

00:29:48.541 --> 00:29:49.958
Arnab's school.

00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:52.458
Kalagachhia Kailash Kamini High School.

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:56.208
I see.
- I have heard lot of stories about it.

00:29:56.708 --> 00:29:57.000
Rana.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.958
That means uncle's house must be close-by.

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:03.958
Maybe. Let's go that way.

00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.041
Rana. I should've worn a sari, right?

00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:21.875
Just hold this. - Sari.

00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:23.250
You wear a sari as well.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.250
Do you have one?

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.083
Don't worry, Mrs. Bagchi. You are looking nice.

00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:30.375
Come.

00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:33.416
I am meeting them for the first time. - I know

00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:35.666
Arnab Bagchi. - No.

00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.583
Then, does any other Bagchi family live around here?

00:30:39.083 --> 00:30:41.291
Look, madam. We've been living here for the past 30 years.

00:30:41.791 --> 00:30:43.708
But we never heard of any Bagchi family..

00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:50.458
..or any Arnab Bagchi.

00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:51.125
Thank you.

00:30:51.625 --> 00:30:55.125
Who is Arnab Bagchi? - Thank you.

00:30:57.958 --> 00:31:01.458
Can you come in, please?

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:09.833
What happened? Been punished?

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:12.625
What is this? - This is a flying swan.

00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:14.875
I see, that's a flying swan. - Yes.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:16.958
It looks more like a dead duck to me.

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:20.958
Okay, see you.

00:31:30.125 --> 00:31:34.250
No, dear. There was no Arnab Bagchi that year.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.916
Why can't I access Milan Damji's record?

00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:38.458
Its showing me "Restricted" each time.

00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:41.500
Madam, I will need Mr. Tyagi's
permission to unlock it

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.500
Where is Tyagi? - He's on leave today.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.750
Coming, mother.

00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:41.083
Hello.

00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:42.416
Agnes. - Yes.

00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:45.000
Hi. - Can you meet me tomorrow?

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.041
Of course. - At 3 o'clock.

00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:49.875
Where?
- There's a restaurant at Park Street.

00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:52.250
Mocambo. - Mocambo.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.125
See you. - Take care.

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:57.125
Bye.

00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:15.375
Bishnu.

00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:20.125
Bishnu! - Coming, sister.

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:24.625
Hey you...where are you?

00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:28.625
Watch it. - Move aside.

00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:32.083
Here you go.

00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:36.083
Radio.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.250
Kalighat.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.458
Just a minute.

00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:45.958
Rana. Call from the airport.

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:46.333
Hello.

00:33:46.833 --> 00:33:48.333
Better explain that Bidya Bagchi.

00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:48.875
Yes, yes, yes.

00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:50.833
That Arnab or whoever..

00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:52.375
He got her pregnant and ran away.

00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:53.083
That's often the case.

00:33:53.583 --> 00:33:53.958
Hello.

00:33:54.458 --> 00:33:55.875
Tell her not to waste time here in this condition..

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:57.458
..and return to London.

00:33:57.958 --> 00:33:59.541
Oh, so you checked.

00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:01.416
I have been thinking about it for the past 30 years.

00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:04.625
But he ran away in 2 years. - I see.

00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:06.666
Sorry, will you say it again.

00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:09.250
Would you like a cup of tea, sir? - No, its fine.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.958
Thank you.

00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:16.458
Hi.

00:34:16.958 --> 00:34:18.666
Mr. Das. - Good morning, madam.

00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:20.458
Good afternoon, Mr. Das. - Whatever you say, madam.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:24.250
Good afternoon, Rana. - Good afternoon.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.958
Radio.

00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:28.458
Are you going anywhere? - To meet Agnes.

00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:29.916
I will drop you there.

00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:32.083
I won't need your chariot today, Satyaki.

00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:34.708
My taxi is waiting.

00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:38.250
Okay.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.833
Mrs. Bagchi, we checked..

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:43.250
..with Kolkata and London's immigration departments.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.625
The date that you told us..

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.791
..no Arnab Bagchi left from London..

00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.666
..or arrived in Kolkata.

00:34:51.166 --> 00:34:53.375
Then surely there's a mistake in the system.

00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:54.375
We double-checked it.

00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:55.666
Triple-checked it.

00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:59.666
That's the truth.

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:08.875
Thank you.

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:20.708
Yesterday after you left..

00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:22.791
..I took a close look at the photo.

00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:23.833
And you know what.

00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:27.083
Your husband's face resembles..

00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:28.750
..an ex-employ of ours.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.916
Milan Damji. - Who?

00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.166
Milan Damji.

00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:34.833
Two years ago he left office.

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.291
He was a funny one.

00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:37.750
He would stay silent.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.166
He joined suddenly and even left suddenly.

00:35:41.666 --> 00:35:42.916
His blood group was funny as well.

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:44.791
Bombay blood group.

00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:48.375
I clearly remember the day he left the company.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:51.375
A lot of people came looking for him.

00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:52.625
He disappeared.

00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:53.583
Poof.

00:35:54.083 --> 00:35:56.416
But what is the connection with Arnab?

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:57.875
Two years ago he was in London.

00:35:58.375 --> 00:36:01.416
Milan Damji looks just like Arnab.

00:36:01.916 --> 00:36:03.666
That's why yesterday I tried..

00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:06.500
..to get the file from the computer.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.500
But it would always show me the same message..

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.500
.."Restricted. Restricted. Restricted".

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.041
God knows how to operate these computers.

00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:18.250
Today when Tyagi returns.. - Tyagi?

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.250
Tyagi here.

00:36:24.958 --> 00:36:26.500
Who wants Milan Damji's records?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.625
If I can't access the computer..

00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.166
..then the employ records are in the old office.

00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:34.833
Maybe there's a photo in that.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:38.375
Agnes, thank you.

00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:39.958
But after seeing Milan's photo..

00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:42.416
Just see Milan Damji's photo once.

00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:46.416
Then decide on it.

00:36:58.041 --> 00:37:01.541
Bob!

00:37:03.208 --> 00:37:06.291
Bob. You can't do anything.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:07.791
The figures are so bad.

00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:10.250
You can't get a single
life insurance client.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:15.541
If this goes on then soon
you will be fired from this job.

00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:17.375
For God's sake, switch off the phone..

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.291
..and concentrate on your targets.

00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:23.291
Client, sir. - Disgusting.

00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:53.541
Yes. - Hello.

00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:54.458
Hello.

00:37:54.958 --> 00:37:56.916
Agnes D'Mello. - Yes.

00:37:57.416 --> 00:38:00.916
Just a minute...

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:16.833
Oh, it was a wig.

00:38:46.041 --> 00:38:47.708
Good morning, sir.

00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:49.291
Sir, he's in a meeting.

00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:53.291
Gentlemen, we've to ensure that we do this.

00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:01.791
Excuse me.

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:07.833
I've to go to Kolkata today, right now.
- Why?

00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:10.958
No smoking inside the building, Khan.
- I know.

00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:14.875
Someone shot NDC's HR manager. - So.

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:16.958
That's the local police station's case.

00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:19.291
Why do you have to go to Kolkata for that?

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:23.291
She was trying to access Milan's record.

00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:26.916
What other information do you have?

00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:29.750
There's a pregnant lady, from London.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.291
Vidya Bagchi.

00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:37.375
Listen, on the sixth day..
- I need this room empty..

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:38.500
..for a while.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.750
Everyone go out.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.083
What?

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:45.083
Didn't you hear?

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:50.833
I need this room empty. - Who are you?

00:39:51.333 --> 00:39:51.583
What is your name?

00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:54.458
Get out. - What the.. Khan.

00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:58.166
That's my name What the.. Khan.

00:39:58.666 --> 00:39:59.541
Anything else?

00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:00.541
No, sir.

00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:02.083
Call Vidya Bagchi. - Yes.

00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:04.166
I want her here in 10 minutes.

00:40:04.666 --> 00:40:08.166
Okay, sir.

00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:11.916
Tell me.

00:40:12.416 --> 00:40:13.750
I am a pregnant woman, sir.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.833
You shouldn't be smoking in front of me.

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.875
Mrs. Bagchi, we don't know much
about each other.

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:23.000
So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.625
Let's come to the point.

00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:26.083
Tell me.

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:28.666
How are you related to Agnes?

00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:34.583
My husband Arnab Bagchi is missing.

00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:35.041
What happened?

00:40:35.541 --> 00:40:35.916
Why is everyone outside?

00:40:36.416 --> 00:40:38.500
That Vidya Bagchi, it's a big problem.
- Really?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.458
Yes. - What are you saying?

00:40:42.958 --> 00:40:44.166
Mrs. Bagchi.

00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:45.583
What is going on?

00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:47.083
Look.. - Who are you?

00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:48.666
Look, I am talking to her. - Out.

00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:52.666
But who are you? - Out.

00:40:55.708 --> 00:40:58.375
Close the door behind you.

00:40:58.875 --> 00:41:01.958
Out!

00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:05.958
Yes, so what were you saying?

00:41:07.833 --> 00:41:08.583
Who is he?

00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:12.583
Arnab's face resembles
her ex-employ Milan Damji.

00:41:13.083 --> 00:41:14.458
And Agnes..
- There was never an employee..

00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:16.416
..called Milan there.

00:41:16.916 --> 00:41:19.541
I feel Agnes doesn't know anything.

00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:21.791
Are you sure?

00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:23.541
Because I remember correctly..

00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:26.583
..that Agnes said Milan Damji.

00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:30.916
Mrs. Bagchi, I know more about NDC..

00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:33.000
..than you and Agnes.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.208
2000 employees work there, understand?

00:41:38.708 --> 00:41:39.750
I am quite sure.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.041
Yes, she also said that..

00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:45.750
..when she tried to access
Milan Damji's record..

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.041
..she was getting "Restricted"..
- You aren't listening to me.

00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:52.041
Are you listening?

00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:56.541
There was no one called Milan.
- No, it's just that..

00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:58.916
..I am sure Agnes said Milan.

00:41:59.416 --> 00:41:59.791
..what I am saying?

00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:01.291
Do you understand..

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:04.666
You are still stuck on Milan.

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:06.416
Don't you understand what I am saying?

00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:08.500
"Milan. Milan. Milan."

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.500
Out!

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.083
Look, I..

00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:22.833
Mrs. Bagchi. Look here.

00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:26.125
I am giving you a free advice,
although I don't.

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:27.541
Get over with whatever
you came here to do..

00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:29.583
..and leave for London.

00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:31.958
That will be best for you
in this condition.

00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:36.125
Do you understand?

00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.750
Mr. Khan.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.083
We don't know each other..

00:42:41.583 --> 00:42:47.791
..so leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:51.083
And anyway, you don't
give free advices, don't you?

00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:53.000
That's good.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.291
You shouldn't either.

00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:56.541
Quiet.

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.541
Sir, sorry.

00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:02.541
Take all this inside.

00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:04.500
Mrs. Bagchi, I will drop you.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.125
Come.

00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:08.375
No, no, no. No need to worry, sir.

00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:10.250
It's a simple case.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.083
Actually.

00:43:14.583 --> 00:43:19.958
Agnes confused her husband with Milan.

00:43:20.458 --> 00:43:21.333
That Vidya Bagchi.

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:24.333
Her husband got her pregnant
and disappeared.

00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:27.666
No, no, it's completely harmless.

00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:28.875
I will get her background checked.

00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:30.083
Don't worry at all.

00:43:30.583 --> 00:43:33.875
Don't waste time on
that pregnant woman, Khan.

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:37.875
Tell me about Milan.

00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:47.166
Give me Captain Bajpayee.

00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:49.458
Yes.

00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:52.375
For God's sake get a mobile, Bajpayee.
- Why?

00:43:52.875 --> 00:43:53.833
Why do I need a mobile?

00:43:54.333 --> 00:43:55.666
I stay at home the entire day.

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:59.250
When...can you come to the office? - Why?

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.625
I needed to discuss
something important with you..

00:44:04.125 --> 00:44:07.041
..about Milan Damji.

00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:09.333
Hello.

00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:11.916
Bajpayee. - I am right here, go on.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:15.916
Can you come to the office? - No.

00:44:31.583 --> 00:44:34.125
Rana. If I address someone
by his first name..

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:36.166
..then what does it mean?

00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:39.791
That you know him really well.

00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.583
'There's no one called Milan there.'

00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:43.000
'Actually there is no Milan.'

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.958
'Milan. Milan. Milan.'

00:44:45.458 --> 00:44:46.750
According to Khan, Milan Damji is someone..

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.083
..who doesn't exist at all.

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:52.708
Yet, he said Milan instead of Milan Damji.

00:44:53.208 --> 00:44:55.458
Why?

00:44:55.958 --> 00:44:56.916
I am going to NDC.

00:44:57.416 --> 00:45:02.375
If I find out anything, I will call you.

00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:05.666
No, sir. There is no
Milan Damji in our records.

00:45:06.166 --> 00:45:10.333
How long have you
been working here? - Sir, 1 years.

00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:14.333
And you never heard
the name of Milan Damji? - No, sir.

00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:17.041
Sapna, do you..

00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:18.333
You?

00:45:18.833 --> 00:45:22.541
Sir, he was inquiring about
Agnes D'Mello's murder case.

00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:25.708
Do you have any authorization?

00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:27.333
I am standing right behind you?

00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:30.083
Whose name is Rana?

00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:33.250
Sir. I am Rana.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.208
Why did you go there?

00:45:34.708 --> 00:45:35.708
With whose permission?

00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:37.500
Without any permission, or a warrant.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.666
To hell with the warrant, first tell me..

00:45:40.166 --> 00:45:41.791
Why do you have to
conduct a local investigation..

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:43.958
..when this is a IB case?

00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:45.541
Next time if I see you following up..

00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:47.541
..without my permission.

00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:49.291
Then you will be
telling the traffic police..

00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.416
..about the traffic from
the control room, understand.

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:55.500
No, sir, actually..
- Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.333
Will you work for the traffic control?

00:45:57.833 --> 00:45:59.500
Do you want to work for
the traffic control?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Out.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.375
Who else?

00:46:02.875 --> 00:46:06.375
Do you? Out.

00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:11.000
What?

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.500
Didn't you understand what I said?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.500
Out.

00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:22.375
How long have you been doing service?
- Six months, sir.

00:46:22.875 --> 00:46:24.833
Do you love your job?

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:28.833
Do you want to keep working? - Yes, sir.

00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:37.333
Here.

00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:43.333
Mrs. Bagchi, I think Khan sir is right.

00:46:43.833 --> 00:46:45.166
Agnes must be confused with someone.

00:46:45.666 --> 00:46:49.666
See, NDC has at least 2000 employees..
- Exactly, Rana.

00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:51.541
2000 employees work in NDC..

00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:55.250
..so why did Agnes take Milan Damji's name?

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.541
She wasn't wrong?

00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:58.916
And you know, Agnes never said anything..

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:02.916
..until she hadn't seen
Arnab's photo properly.

00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:11.291
What happened?

00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:15.000
Why are those women
wearing such a sari? - Them?

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500
The red and white sari.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.208
They wear it on any auspicious day.

00:47:19.708 --> 00:47:21.375
But why?

00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:23.458
'White sari with red border?'

00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:24.916
'Why should I wear that?'

00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:25.916
'Why? Why?'

00:47:26.416 --> 00:47:27.000
'It's traditional.'

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.666
'Everyone wears that
on the last day of Durga Puja.'

00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:32.666
'Everyone, even men?'

00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:36.333
'I will surely get one
when I go to Kolkata, Mrs. Bagchi.'

00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:39.500
'And trust me, even you will look awesome.'

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.833
'What?'

00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:45.416
Oh, God.

00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:48.791
'What?'

00:47:49.291 --> 00:47:51.166
'Mr. Vidya Bagchi, don't bore me.'

00:47:51.666 --> 00:47:55.625
'And drop this stupid idea
of making me wear a sari.'

00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:59.625
'Just go to Kolkata quietly
and come back quickly.'

00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:09.750
And then I forced him to go to Kolkata.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.291
He's an idiot as well.

00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.750
He came here.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.750
He had this bad habit
of doing whatever I said.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.250
I am completely sure you will find Arnab.

00:48:42.458 --> 00:48:44.666
Can I say something, if you don't mind?

00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:48.041
That sari, the one that woman was wearing.

00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:52.041
The day you find Arnab,
you can wear that sari.

00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:56.041
That will be the auspicious day for you.

00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:02.666
Arnab won't be found so easily.

00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:05.458
I will have to look for him.

00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:07.625
That's the point, Mrs. Bagchi.

00:49:08.125 --> 00:49:10.083
How will we look for him?

00:49:10.583 --> 00:49:12.208
Milan Damji does not exist.

00:49:12.708 --> 00:49:17.791
He's some story that
you believe to be true.

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.291
Rana.

00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:20.916
Agnes said..

00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:23.583
'The employee records are in
the old office.'

00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:27.791
'There might be a photo in it.'

00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:30.208
What are you saying?

00:49:30.708 --> 00:49:31.666
How can we barge inside someone's office?

00:49:32.166 --> 00:49:34.791
That too, the National Data Centre.
- But it's closed down.

00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:36.000
Sapna. - Yes, sir.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.500
Do you have hard copies of
the old employees?

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.583
No, sir. Everything's on the system.

00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:42.500
You sure? - Yes, sir.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.666
Sir.

00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:46.083
There might be some in the old office.

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:50.291
There's nothing here.

00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:51.000
Hello.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.000
Write down, third floor.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.458
Third floor. - 12 R.N. Mukherjee Road.

00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:03.750
It's the NDC old office.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:07.416
There's a file on Milan Damji..
- Who is Milan Damji?

00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:09.708
No one. Just do as I say.

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:14.625
Get the file. - Bob.

00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:19.583
Client. - Good.

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:23.583
Let's go.

00:50:32.666 --> 00:50:36.166
This one.

00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:41.041
Oh, God. That's a big lock. I can't do it.

00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:45.333
Rana. Open it. - How?

00:50:45.833 --> 00:50:48.958
Mrs. Bagchi, I am the police
not a thief. - Really?

00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:52.583
Open it.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:53.500
This is great.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.125
The police is breaking
and entering himself.

00:50:56.625 --> 00:51:00.125
Very good.

00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:30.291
There are millions of file here.

00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:34.291
How will we find it?

00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:39.458
This is not done.

00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:41.166
We'll have to look for the HR department.

00:51:41.666 --> 00:51:43.541
It's a big thing I got in here.

00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:45.250
Meaning?

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:49.250
I will explain that later.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.125
What's written here?

00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:57.125
That's Xerox.

00:52:03.916 --> 00:52:05.666
This door.

00:52:06.166 --> 00:52:08.000
Chief accounts.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.250
Nope.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.250
Rana. H.R.D.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.666
Look there.

00:52:38.166 --> 00:52:39.583
If it exists then it
must be somewhere here..

00:52:40.083 --> 00:52:40.500
..or it doesn't exist.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.500
If Agnes has said it, then it must be here.

00:52:50.416 --> 00:52:52.291
DE. DH. DU.

00:52:52.791 --> 00:52:59.083
DS. DC. D...DH.

00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.166
DA.

00:53:01.666 --> 00:53:02.958
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up. Please.

00:53:03.458 --> 00:53:06.958
Just a minute, Rana.

00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:12.583
Milan Damji.

00:54:14.708 --> 00:54:16.958
There was no file on Milan Damji.

00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:18.500
Milan Damji exists.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.500
Who is Milan Damji?

00:54:25.041 --> 00:54:27.125
Where did you get this paper from?

00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:28.500
What difference does that make?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:29.500
Who is Milan Damji?

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.416
Is he your husband?

00:54:31.916 --> 00:54:33.291
Take a good look.

00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:34.791
Is he your husband?

00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:36.166
Take a look.

00:54:36.666 --> 00:54:38.041
No. - He isn't.

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:41.375
Then what difference
does it make about who he is.

00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:42.375
Forget Milan Damji..

00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:44.625
..and I will forget where
you got this paper from.

00:54:45.125 --> 00:54:45.916
End of matter.

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.041
Milan Damji isn't Arnab.

00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:49.666
But he does look like Arnab..

00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:52.916
..and if something has
happened to my husband..

00:54:53.416 --> 00:54:54.833
..because of that, then it is very
important for me to know..

00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:57.958
..who Milan Damji is.

00:54:58.458 --> 00:55:02.958
Either you tell me or you leave it to me.

00:55:03.458 --> 00:55:07.083
I will find the answer
and come back to you.

00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:11.083
How will you find out?

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.125
I will go out and ask every person.

00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:22.166
Even if he's a common man
on the streets, the police.

00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:25.458
Or the media?

00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:31.291
Someone will surely have
an answer to this question.

00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:33.583
Sit down, Mrs. Bagchi.

00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:37.583
Sit down.

00:55:42.083 --> 00:55:42.666
Do you know anything about..

00:55:43.166 --> 00:55:46.500
..the attack on Kolkata Metro
two years ago?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.125
Yes.

00:55:48.625 --> 00:55:50.875
Milan Damji was behind that attack.

00:55:51.375 --> 00:55:55.916
He's the prime suspect in this case.

00:55:56.416 --> 00:55:59.041
Then why doesn't anyone know
about Milan Damji.

00:55:59.541 --> 00:56:03.166
Milan Damji doesn't exist
for the world, that's why.

00:56:03.666 --> 00:56:04.750
He didn't exist for me either.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.125
Until the day I was given the
task to catch him.

00:56:08.625 --> 00:56:10.541
But until then it was too late.

00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:12.750
Milan disappeared and
so did all his reports.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.458
But how can anyone just disappear?

00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:16.458
It can be our agents.

00:56:16.958 --> 00:56:18.000
Milan was a government agent.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:18.583
He betrayed us.

00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:19.666
Joined hands with the enemy.

00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:22.250
We have been hiding this from the people.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.416
Not just that, there's someone
in our system..

00:56:24.916 --> 00:56:27.375
..who is helping Milan.

00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:32.916
This is a dangerous game, Mrs. Bagchi.

00:56:33.416 --> 00:56:35.333
Those who want to keep Milan
safe are very powerful people.

00:56:35.833 --> 00:56:39.333
They can do anything.

00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:48.125
Welcome to Metro Railway.

00:56:48.625 --> 00:56:51.250
Welcome to Metro Railway.

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.750
Welcome to Metro Railway.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.650
Greetings, madam.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:01.366
Madam. I am so sorry.

00:57:01.866 --> 00:57:02.866
It was a mistake

00:57:03.366 --> 00:57:04.199
Are you alright?

00:57:04.699 --> 00:57:05.991
Thank God,
I saved you today.

00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:07.491
My reflexes.

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:08.574
What if I can't save you tomorrow?

00:57:09.074 --> 00:57:11.282
Oh, God. One shouldn't think like that.

00:57:11.782 --> 00:57:14.032
You and your child should stay safe.

00:57:14.532 --> 00:57:15.949
I will pray to God for that.

00:57:16.449 --> 00:57:18.532
I will pray to God for that.

00:57:19.032 --> 00:57:19.491
Madam.

00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:22.657
Madam. Kolkata, dangerous city.

00:57:23.157 --> 00:57:23.616
Right?

00:57:24.116 --> 00:57:26.407
Anything can happen here at anytime.

00:57:26.907 --> 00:57:28.116
I am explaining her for her own good.

00:57:28.616 --> 00:57:29.532
Go back.

00:57:30.032 --> 00:57:32.491
Go back, madam. Go back.

00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:39.032
Very dangerous city, Kolkata.

00:57:39.532 --> 00:57:41.782
No.

00:57:42.282 --> 00:57:43.866
I don't want to come back.

00:57:44.366 --> 00:57:46.991
You can have your bureau, your system.

00:57:47.491 --> 00:57:48.282
One project.

00:57:48.782 --> 00:57:50.116
Just one project failed.

00:57:50.616 --> 00:57:52.491
That means we shut down the bureau?

00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:55.741
Shut down the system.. - Just one project?

00:57:56.241 --> 00:57:57.866
How easily you can say that, Bhaskaran?

00:57:58.366 --> 00:57:58.699
"Just one project."

00:57:59.199 --> 00:58:01.366
You gave me this assignment, Bhaskaran.

00:58:01.866 --> 00:58:03.991
Choose three common people, train them..

00:58:04.491 --> 00:58:05.866
..and make them the bureau's best agents.

00:58:06.366 --> 00:58:07.032
And what did I do?

00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:09.949
I created a monster.

00:58:10.449 --> 00:58:11.449
I found two good people..

00:58:11.949 --> 00:58:13.699
..but an animal like Milan Damji
got trained as well.

00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:17.657
And he joined hands with those
he had to save us from.

00:58:18.157 --> 00:58:23.116
He killed the very civilians
I trained him to protect.

00:58:23.616 --> 00:58:26.324
We will find Milan, you just come back.

00:58:26.824 --> 00:58:29.491
You cannot find Milan, Bhaskaran,
that's the point.

00:58:29.991 --> 00:58:32.699
I trained him. You cannot find him.

00:58:33.199 --> 00:58:35.657
Only fools like you and me can be found..

00:58:36.157 --> 00:58:39.782
..who keep ranting "Our system is perfect".

00:58:40.282 --> 00:58:41.449
"Law has the upper hand."

00:58:41.949 --> 00:58:43.907
"There is no corruption in our system."

00:58:44.407 --> 00:58:47.116
"Everything is hunky-dory."
Rubbish

00:58:47.616 --> 00:58:49.782
Bhaskaran.

00:58:50.282 --> 00:58:53.741
One man helped Milan Damji to flee.

00:58:54.241 --> 00:58:55.991
That man is still working in your bureau..

00:58:56.491 --> 00:58:58.949
..right under your nose.

00:58:59.449 --> 00:59:02.949
The day you find him,
that day I will come back.

00:59:15.032 --> 00:59:17.032
Rana, three things are possible.

00:59:17.532 --> 00:59:24.032
One...Arnab has left me and fled.

00:59:24.532 --> 00:59:28.699
Two...Arnab and
Milan Damji are the same person.

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:32.366
And third...
Arnab looks just like Milan Damji..

00:59:32.866 --> 00:59:37.282
..and that's why Arnab's in trouble.

00:59:37.782 --> 00:59:39.699
That must have happened.

00:59:40.199 --> 00:59:42.782
So you are saying that Arnab's, looks like him and so..
- I am sure.

00:59:43.282 --> 00:59:45.407
We will have to find Milan in order to find Arnab.

00:59:45.907 --> 00:59:49.866
And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.

00:59:50.366 --> 00:59:51.991
Mrs. Bagchi, how is that possible?

00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:53.282
How will we find someone..

00:59:53.782 --> 00:59:55.657
..we don't know anything about?
- From his house.

00:59:56.157 --> 00:59:57.491
Meaning? - I mean Agnes' file..

00:59:57.991 --> 01:00:01.491
..had Milan Damji's residential address.

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:19.907
How much further?

01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:23.907
Ten minutes.

01:00:37.574 --> 01:00:41.074
Sorry.

01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.532
It must be somewhere around here?

01:00:51.032 --> 01:00:54.532
Which way is Bishambar Malik Lane.

01:00:57.157 --> 01:00:59.157
Mrs. Bagchi, this is Bishambar Malik Lane.

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:02.074
Sister, where is number 9?
- This one.

01:01:02.574 --> 01:01:03.032
This one? - Yes.

01:01:03.532 --> 01:01:07.032
This is the one. Come.

01:01:08.949 --> 01:01:12.449
Number nine. Come on.

01:01:17.532 --> 01:01:22.824
You can climb up, can you? - Yes. Let's go.

01:01:23.324 --> 01:01:24.532
Carefully.

01:01:25.032 --> 01:01:26.407
I don't know which one it is.

01:01:26.907 --> 01:01:28.657
There are no numbers.

01:01:29.157 --> 01:01:30.241
Hey...look, it's the police.

01:01:30.741 --> 01:01:32.199
What's wrong sir.

01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:33.741
Nothing's wrong.

01:01:34.241 --> 01:01:34.866
Where is number three?

01:01:35.366 --> 01:01:36.491
That way, but it's locked...

01:01:36.991 --> 01:01:38.532
Nothing, nothing.

01:01:39.032 --> 01:01:42.157
Come.

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:46.324
Here it is. - But it's locked.

01:01:46.824 --> 01:01:50.324
I see. Give it.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:54.991
The police is breaking and entering himself.

01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:58.991
You said so once.

01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:05.782
Wait.

01:02:15.116 --> 01:02:17.782
I wonder why anyone needed to lock this place.

01:02:18.282 --> 01:02:19.324
There's nothing here.

01:02:19.824 --> 01:02:20.491
And even if there was anything..

01:02:20.991 --> 01:02:23.616
..then Khan must have taken it away .

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:25.574
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:27.282
Mrs. Bagchi. - Yes.

01:02:27.782 --> 01:02:28.324
Let's go from here.

01:02:28.824 --> 01:02:30.157
There's nothing here.

01:02:30.657 --> 01:02:34.157
Yes, let me take a look.

01:02:40.532 --> 01:02:42.991
Mrs. Bagchi, don't do that.
- No, no, I am okay.

01:02:43.491 --> 01:02:48.407
I will surely find something.

01:02:48.907 --> 01:02:52.407
Let's look there.

01:03:00.949 --> 01:03:04.449
Did you see, Rana,
only flat no.3 didn't have a letter-box?

01:03:09.657 --> 01:03:10.366
Who is it?

01:03:10.866 --> 01:03:14.366
Did any letters arrive for no.3?
- There is one.

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:34.574
There in no.9.

01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:35.324
Just a minute.

01:03:35.824 --> 01:03:37.491
Poltu, come here.

01:03:37.991 --> 01:03:38.282
Where are you?

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:40.491
Rana, Milan used to order tea from here.

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.074
Maybe they might know something.

01:03:42.574 --> 01:03:44.157
But how do you know?

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:46.991
You offered me tea in a similar glass in the police station.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.199
'Would you like some tea."

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:49.241
See what they are asking for.

01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:50.699
Remember, there were two similar glasses..

01:03:51.199 --> 01:03:52.074
..at Milan's house. - Yes.

01:03:52.574 --> 01:03:55.282
Now, there was no kitchen in Milan's home, so.. - Sister.

01:03:55.782 --> 01:03:56.324
Poltu.

01:03:56.824 --> 01:03:59.074
Just a minute.

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:01.616
Are you scared?

01:04:02.116 --> 01:04:03.616
He is my friend.

01:04:04.116 --> 01:04:05.699
What is your name? - Poltu.

01:04:06.199 --> 01:04:08.116
Poltu? Pet name or real name?

01:04:08.616 --> 01:04:10.949
Pet name. Real name is Shubroto.

01:04:11.449 --> 01:04:14.282
Shubroto, no need to be scared.

01:04:14.782 --> 01:04:15.991
So tell me, do you remember anything..

01:04:16.491 --> 01:04:18.032
..about the person in flat no.3?

01:04:18.532 --> 01:04:20.282
Flat no.3? No.

01:04:20.782 --> 01:04:21.157
Anything.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:22.866
I mean what kind of a person he was.

01:04:23.366 --> 01:04:24.032
Short-tempered.

01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:28.991
Or would he smile each time you delivered tea.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:33.574
Would he say something?
- No, he wouldn't say anything, but..

01:04:34.074 --> 01:04:36.949
He would order only one type of tea.

01:04:37.449 --> 01:04:40.657
And sometimes a second person
would come to meet him.

01:04:41.157 --> 01:04:42.032
That's when he would order two teas.

01:04:42.532 --> 01:04:43.241
Yes, there was someone.

01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:45.074
Who was the other person?

01:04:45.574 --> 01:04:47.366
He would always carry a suitcase.

01:04:47.866 --> 01:04:49.574
And the edges were like gold.

01:04:50.074 --> 01:04:52.574
Suitcase?

01:04:53.074 --> 01:04:56.241
This big. - Briefcase.

01:04:56.741 --> 01:05:01.741
Oh, you look so handsome
when you smile, Shubroto.

01:05:02.241 --> 01:05:05.824
You can win any child's heart so easily.

01:05:06.324 --> 01:05:08.616
I am completely sure. - What?

01:05:09.116 --> 01:05:13.366
That you will be a great mother.

01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:14.116
What is this?

01:05:14.616 --> 01:05:16.782
Donation bills. Nonsense.

01:05:17.282 --> 01:05:19.157
He said there's a letter from the bank.

01:05:19.657 --> 01:05:20.741
But this is a blood bank.

01:05:21.241 --> 01:05:24.532
People's blood bank.

01:05:25.032 --> 01:05:25.991
Bombay blood group.

01:05:26.491 --> 01:05:30.366
Rana, Agnes had said that
Milan had a rare blood group.

01:05:30.866 --> 01:05:32.282
'Bombay blood group.'

01:05:32.782 --> 01:05:34.699
Sir, if any person has a rare blood group..

01:05:35.199 --> 01:05:36.991
..then he stores his blood with us.

01:05:37.491 --> 01:05:38.616
So that if there's an emergency..

01:05:39.116 --> 01:05:42.116
..then he can use his blood. - I see.

01:05:42.616 --> 01:05:44.991
When was blood required last in this case?

01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:46.991
Will you check it and tell us?

01:05:47.491 --> 01:05:53.074
Just a wait a minute, I will tell you. - Of course.

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.532
There was a requirement for this rare blood group..

01:05:56.032 --> 01:05:57.116
..on May 2008, 25th May.

01:05:57.616 --> 01:05:59.866
And we received a call from Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:06:00.366 --> 01:06:03.866
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:06:08.074 --> 01:06:09.157
Not a single paper.

01:06:09.657 --> 01:06:10.824
No records, nothing.

01:06:11.324 --> 01:06:12.449
Must be. It's been erased.

01:06:12.949 --> 01:06:15.449
Just like every other records of Milan.

01:06:15.949 --> 01:06:17.741
Mrs. Bagchi, this is dead end.

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:19.407
Come on, Satyaki.

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:20.657
There must be something somewhere.

01:06:21.157 --> 01:06:23.616
I am not going to accept defeat.

01:06:24.116 --> 01:06:25.282
You have always helped me.

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:29.282
I cannot go further without your help, really.

01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:35.324
There's one man who can help us.

01:06:35.824 --> 01:06:39.324
He was once a police informer.

01:06:54.199 --> 01:06:57.657
Sorry.

01:06:58.157 --> 01:07:01.657
Come.

01:07:06.616 --> 01:07:10.116
Careful. Careful.

01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:15.866
Are you fine?

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.866
Thank you.

01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:31.199
Brother, can you tell me where is Paras?

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:32.282
Brother?

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:37.157
There. There.

01:07:37.657 --> 01:07:41.032
Paras.

01:07:41.532 --> 01:07:43.616
No. I have no connections with the police now.

01:07:44.116 --> 01:07:47.282
But, Paras, we just need a small information.

01:07:47.782 --> 01:07:49.741
Look, whether the information is
small or big...

01:07:50.241 --> 01:07:51.032
I don't give it anymore.

01:07:51.532 --> 01:07:54.074
Paras. Please.

01:07:54.574 --> 01:07:55.782
Please leave.

01:07:56.282 --> 01:08:00.116
If someone spots us
then it will mean trouble.

01:08:00.616 --> 01:08:06.032
Brother Paras. I am searching
for my husband.

01:08:06.532 --> 01:08:08.741
I came from London in this
condition all alone.

01:08:09.241 --> 01:08:12.366
I just need an answer for my child..

01:08:12.866 --> 01:08:15.907
..that what happened to his father.

01:08:16.407 --> 01:08:19.907
I cannot force you, but...please help us.

01:08:26.324 --> 01:08:26.657
Tell me.

01:08:27.157 --> 01:08:31.157
Have you heard about Milan Damji? - Who?

01:08:31.657 --> 01:08:34.532
Milan Damji. No.

01:08:35.032 --> 01:08:37.407
Two years ago, on 25th May..

01:08:37.907 --> 01:08:40.699
..Bombay blood group was
required in Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:08:41.199 --> 01:08:41.824
What for?

01:08:42.324 --> 01:08:43.491
We just need to find that out.

01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:47.491
Can you do that?

01:08:53.866 --> 01:08:57.366
Laundry, sister.

01:08:59.574 --> 01:09:00.074
Laundry, sister.

01:09:00.574 --> 01:09:04.074
I am not laundry sister, I am sister Bidya.

01:09:06.657 --> 01:09:09.116
Your transistor is giving chocolate.

01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:10.074
Such a big chocolate.

01:09:10.574 --> 01:09:12.074
So big.

01:09:12.574 --> 01:09:13.324
Hello.

01:09:13.824 --> 01:09:16.991
You did disturb me, I am in a important meeting.

01:09:17.491 --> 01:09:20.449
In the room with Bishnu.

01:09:20.949 --> 01:09:24.449
Really? When?

01:09:30.741 --> 01:09:33.116
25th May, 2008.

01:09:33.616 --> 01:09:35.824
Two men had a meeting here.

01:09:36.324 --> 01:09:42.407
There was news about only two
people's death until now.

01:09:42.907 --> 01:09:46.116
But it seems like there
was a third person as well.

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:50.241
And the blood was ordered from
Ekbalpur Nursing Home..

01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:51.699
..for this third person.

01:09:52.199 --> 01:09:53.741
So, was that third person Milan Damji?

01:09:54.241 --> 01:09:56.199
I don't have anymore information.

01:09:56.699 --> 01:09:57.532
Paras. Paras.

01:09:58.032 --> 01:09:59.074
Just a minute.

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:00.907
You will find the rest of the information..

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:04.282
..at Park Street Police Station
or find Dr. Ganguly.

01:10:04.782 --> 01:10:08.282
That night he was on night duty.

01:10:12.032 --> 01:10:13.241
No record.

01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:15.324
I remember that it was a police case..

01:10:15.824 --> 01:10:18.324
..but I don't remember what exactly it was.

01:10:18.824 --> 01:10:19.616
It was two years ago. - Ready, sir.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:21.366
Yes, I will be there. - Okay.

01:10:21.866 --> 01:10:23.949
Give me a day, I will check and tell you.

01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:25.032
Thank you.
- I need to go, I have a surgery.

01:10:25.532 --> 01:10:29.032
Thank you.

01:10:38.074 --> 01:10:38.616
Don't worry. - Okay.

01:10:39.116 --> 01:10:39.657
Please. - Thank you, thank you.

01:10:40.157 --> 01:10:43.657
Thank you very much.

01:10:55.491 --> 01:10:56.532
Yes.

01:10:57.032 --> 01:10:58.491
Dr. Ganguly? - Yes.

01:10:58.991 --> 01:11:01.032
Hello. Bob Biswas.

01:11:01.532 --> 01:11:01.991
Hello.

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:05.991
Just a minute.

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:13.032
'I remember that it was a police case.'

01:11:13.532 --> 01:11:14.491
Stop it Rana.

01:11:14.991 --> 01:11:18.032
The commotion outside and then this.

01:11:18.532 --> 01:11:19.824
Mr. Chatterjee. - What?

01:11:20.324 --> 01:11:21.907
Hello. - Oh my, God.

01:11:22.407 --> 01:11:22.741
Bidya Bagchi.

01:11:23.241 --> 01:11:24.532
You arrived at the right time. - Hi, Rana.

01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:27.199
You had shut this computer up the other day,
didn't you? - Yes.

01:11:27.699 --> 01:11:28.282
Do it today as well, please, - Sure.

01:11:28.782 --> 01:11:29.907
Otherwise I will go crazy.

01:11:30.407 --> 01:11:30.741
Thank you.

01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:34.116
I will go meet the senior officer.

01:11:34.616 --> 01:11:34.824
Come, come.

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:36.032
Oh, God.

01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:37.116
No, no, keep seated.

01:11:37.616 --> 01:11:41.116
He can return any moment.

01:11:42.324 --> 01:11:43.907
Two people were killed at Nonapukur Tram Depot..

01:11:44.407 --> 01:11:45.324
..on the 25th of May.

01:11:45.824 --> 01:11:46.907
One was Dinesh Rao..

01:11:47.407 --> 01:11:50.116
..who was a police informer in the Metro attack case.

01:11:50.616 --> 01:11:53.782
And second..

01:11:54.282 --> 01:11:57.157
Second was Vijay Verma who
was a government agent.

01:11:57.657 --> 01:12:01.157
Government agent?

01:12:02.491 --> 01:12:06.074
He's back, he's back.

01:12:06.574 --> 01:12:07.199
It's done, sir.

01:12:07.699 --> 01:12:09.699
Done, Mr. Chatterjee. - Its, done.

01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:11.616
That's nice, very good.

01:12:12.116 --> 01:12:12.449
Thank you, thank you.

01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:13.741
Thank you. - Welcome.

01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:16.657
Okay.

01:12:17.157 --> 01:12:17.699
What is the matter?

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:21.907
Mr. Chatterjee, may I leave? - Yes.

01:12:22.407 --> 01:12:22.532
Bye.

01:12:23.032 --> 01:12:26.532
Bye.

01:13:02.157 --> 01:13:03.574
Yes, mother.

01:13:04.074 --> 01:13:07.574
I am coming.

01:13:34.157 --> 01:13:35.116
Mrs. Bagchi, what are you doing?

01:13:35.616 --> 01:13:36.449
Why are you cleaning it yourself?

01:13:36.949 --> 01:13:38.766
Wait, I will call the staff?
- No. no, no, no.

01:13:38.771 --> 01:13:39.349
Anybody there?

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.699
I do the cleaning myself at home.

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:43.699
Sit. I cannot tolerate dust.

01:13:44.199 --> 01:13:44.991
Pull a chair.

01:13:45.491 --> 01:13:47.741
Speak, Satyaki Sinha.

01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:49.782
Mrs. Bagchi, I pursued the information..

01:13:50.282 --> 01:13:50.741
..acquired from the database.

01:13:51.241 --> 01:13:53.282
There is no mention of a
third person in the records

01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:56.699
Dr. Ganguly, Milan Damji,
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.991
No one knows anything about it.

01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:01.991
There are records of Vijay and Dinesh.

01:14:02.491 --> 01:14:04.116
Vijay Verma was investigating
the Metro attack..

01:14:04.616 --> 01:14:06.491
..at ground level. - Really?

01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:12.532
That's why he met Dinesh Raut at Nonakpur Tram Depot.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.032
Maybe Dinesh wanted to tell Vijay..

01:14:15.532 --> 01:14:17.574
..something about Milan.

01:14:18.074 --> 01:14:21.074
And someone informed Milan about it.

01:14:21.574 --> 01:14:26.366
Milan killed both of them and got injured in the shootout.

01:14:26.866 --> 01:14:29.032
But the question is that how did Milan know..

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.866
..that Vijay is going to receive information about him?

01:14:32.366 --> 01:14:34.032
Maybe Khan was right.

01:14:34.532 --> 01:14:35.532
There is someone within the system..

01:14:36.032 --> 01:14:37.116
..who is helping Milan.

01:14:37.616 --> 01:14:38.782
One more thing.

01:14:39.282 --> 01:14:40.824
NDC is also involved in this. - Really?

01:14:41.324 --> 01:14:44.116
Mrs. Bagchi, every agent has a local, a fake identity.

01:14:44.616 --> 01:14:45.532
Just like Milan Damji..

01:14:46.032 --> 01:14:48.032
..even Vijay Verma worked for NDC.

01:14:48.532 --> 01:14:52.032
To hide his true identity.

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:57.407
It must be him, take a good look.

01:14:57.907 --> 01:14:59.907
No. it wasn't him.

01:15:00.407 --> 01:15:02.241
Now, now, take a look. - No, sister.

01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:04.282
That wasn't him.

01:15:04.782 --> 01:15:05.574
It's not him. - Are you sure?

01:15:06.074 --> 01:15:07.616
Sure.

01:15:08.116 --> 01:15:09.157
Come, let's take Poltu back.

01:15:09.657 --> 01:15:11.532
I was absolutely sure that..

01:15:12.032 --> 01:15:14.782
Tyagi knew that Agnes is looking for Milan's details.

01:15:15.282 --> 01:15:15.949
And Tyagi stopped you.

01:15:16.449 --> 01:15:17.116
Of course. - Sister.

01:15:17.616 --> 01:15:21.116
What? - The suitcase.

01:15:26.949 --> 01:15:29.699
It was him, sister.

01:15:30.199 --> 01:15:33.199
Are you sure? - Sure, it was him.

01:15:33.699 --> 01:15:35.199
Who was he? - I don't know.

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.824
I suggest that you take Poltu home..

01:15:38.324 --> 01:15:41.032
..until then I will find out, okay. - Yes.

01:15:41.532 --> 01:15:43.074
Good morning, sir.

01:15:43.574 --> 01:15:46.032
Good morning, sir.

01:15:46.532 --> 01:15:50.032
Good morning.

01:16:16.324 --> 01:16:16.907
Turn around.

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:20.907
Turn around.

01:16:38.991 --> 01:16:39.532
Sister. - Yes.

01:16:40.032 --> 01:16:42.574
Will you have tea? - No.

01:16:43.074 --> 01:16:45.991
Listen, when Rana arrives will you ask him to call me.

01:16:46.491 --> 01:16:47.282
The police officer? - Yes.

01:16:47.782 --> 01:16:49.032
Okay. - Yes, fine.

01:16:49.532 --> 01:16:53.032
Bye.

01:17:22.449 --> 01:17:22.616
Sorry.

01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:23.866
Rana.

01:17:24.366 --> 01:17:25.949
I was waiting for you at the tea-stall for so long..

01:17:26.449 --> 01:17:29.949
Blood!

01:17:30.699 --> 01:17:33.741
Oh no.

01:17:34.241 --> 01:17:36.949
Rana, that's him. He tried to kill me.

01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:40.949
Stop. I am the police.

01:18:03.449 --> 01:18:06.032
Stop.

01:18:06.532 --> 01:18:10.032
Move.

01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:14.491
Are you crazy?

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:36.741
Stop. I am the police.

01:18:56.282 --> 01:18:58.116
Stop. Stop.

01:18:58.616 --> 01:19:02.116
Stop.

01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:19.032
Oh, God.

01:19:19.532 --> 01:19:21.741
Mrs. Bagchi, Bob Biswas
was a contract killer.

01:19:22.241 --> 01:19:22.616
This is his phone.

01:19:23.116 --> 01:19:25.491
And I have found these
photographs from his phone.

01:19:25.991 --> 01:19:27.491
Agnes D'Mello.

01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:29.741
Dr. Ganguly.

01:19:30.241 --> 01:19:31.116
And after that...you.

01:19:31.616 --> 01:19:32.116
This time you survived.

01:19:32.616 --> 01:19:33.991
But the man who hired Bob..

01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:36.032
..doesn't want anyone to
reach Milan Damji..

01:19:36.532 --> 01:19:38.741
I gave this photo to Agnes.

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:42.741
Just a minute.

01:19:46.324 --> 01:19:47.657
Look.

01:19:48.157 --> 01:19:50.574
I gave a copy of this photo to Agnes.

01:19:51.074 --> 01:19:53.282
That means whoever gave
Bob the contract is in NDC.

01:19:53.782 --> 01:19:57.574
No, no. It means you didn't
hear whatever I said until now.

01:19:58.074 --> 01:19:59.282
And you don't understand, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:19:59.782 --> 01:20:00.699
Your life is in danger.

01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:01.907
And I will have to tell
Mr. Khan about this.

01:20:02.407 --> 01:20:03.574
Did you find out whose briefcase that was?
- Mrs. Bagchi..

01:20:04.074 --> 01:20:05.491
Who was it?

01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:06.782
He is Shridhar.

01:20:07.282 --> 01:20:07.824
The head of IT department.

01:20:08.324 --> 01:20:11.824
Tyagi reports to him.

01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:18.407
Rana, we thought that
Tyagi is doing everything.

01:20:18.907 --> 01:20:21.032
But Tyagi was only passing the information.

01:20:21.532 --> 01:20:23.782
We have no evidence about it.

01:20:24.282 --> 01:20:24.949
Come, let's go to the police.

01:20:25.449 --> 01:20:26.574
And yes, that phone is a evidence.

01:20:27.074 --> 01:20:27.782
Return it.

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:29.741
Phone.

01:20:30.241 --> 01:20:31.574
Rana. Rana. Look.

01:20:32.074 --> 01:20:34.407
Bob has been sent this
message from some website.

01:20:34.907 --> 01:20:36.324
So?

01:20:36.824 --> 01:20:38.032
Once I hack this website then I will know..

01:20:38.532 --> 01:20:40.282
..whose computer these
photos were sent from.

01:20:40.782 --> 01:20:44.282
What, you..

01:20:45.657 --> 01:20:48.532
Are you a hacker? - Only in my spare time.

01:20:49.032 --> 01:20:52.532
You do know that I am the police,
don't you?

01:20:57.824 --> 01:21:00.407
Yes, yes, yes.

01:21:00.907 --> 01:21:03.324
Sorry.

01:21:03.824 --> 01:21:05.532
This is the IP of the computer..

01:21:06.032 --> 01:21:07.657
..from where the photos the photos were sent.

01:21:08.157 --> 01:21:09.532
And I am completely sure..

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.282
..this is the IP address of that Mr. Briefcase.

01:21:11.782 --> 01:21:12.657
And once that is confirmed..

01:21:13.157 --> 01:21:14.699
..then we can find Milan Damji. - No, no, no.

01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:15.532
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

01:21:16.032 --> 01:21:17.324
This matter is very serious now.

01:21:17.824 --> 01:21:19.324
And I still say that we should go to the police.

01:21:19.824 --> 01:21:21.241
We don't have time, Rana.

01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:24.366
Mr. Briefcase will soon find out that Bob is dead..

01:21:24.866 --> 01:21:26.324
..and then he will try to erase all the records.

01:21:26.824 --> 01:21:27.574
No, Mrs. Bagchi, I.. - Please.

01:21:28.074 --> 01:21:30.157
We should.. - We just have to access Shridhar's computer.

01:21:30.657 --> 01:21:32.532
After that we will go to the police.

01:21:33.032 --> 01:21:37.407
Cross my heart and hope to die.

01:21:37.907 --> 01:21:41.866
You think death is a joke, Vidya?

01:21:42.366 --> 01:21:44.866
Mrs. Bagchi, I have told you so many times..

01:21:45.366 --> 01:21:48.282
..that your life is in danger.

01:21:48.782 --> 01:21:51.116
You even witnessed everything with your own eyes.

01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:57.449
Even after that you are joking about death.

01:21:57.949 --> 01:22:01.116
Maybe because, after Arnab..

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:05.824
..life has become a joke, Rana.

01:22:06.324 --> 01:22:09.824
Shall we?

01:22:21.532 --> 01:22:23.574
Sapna. - Yes, sir.

01:22:24.074 --> 01:22:25.324
You haven't left yet, Sapna.

01:22:25.824 --> 01:22:27.907
Sir, the office is closed due to the veneration tomorrow.

01:22:28.407 --> 01:22:31.449
So I was completing my work.

01:22:31.949 --> 01:22:35.116
It is very good to see someone working so hard.

01:22:35.616 --> 01:22:40.074
One day, when I get the time I will take you out.

01:22:40.574 --> 01:22:42.866
For coffee. - I would love that, sir.

01:22:43.366 --> 01:22:46.324
Bye.

01:22:46.824 --> 01:22:50.657
Good evening sir

01:22:51.157 --> 01:22:55.199
I am coming, darling.

01:22:55.699 --> 01:22:57.616
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

01:22:58.116 --> 01:22:59.199
Why did you keep the visitor's book outside?

01:22:59.699 --> 01:23:03.199
Get the employer's book. - Sorry, sir.

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:08.782
Thank you.

01:23:09.282 --> 01:23:11.324
Come.

01:23:11.824 --> 01:23:18.491
"Some day...somewhere."

01:23:18.991 --> 01:23:24.199
"With this vagabond heart..."

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:28.199
It's not opening.

01:23:33.824 --> 01:23:33.866
Thank you.

01:23:34.366 --> 01:23:34.824
"...we wander around.'

01:23:35.324 --> 01:23:38.741
Thanks.

01:23:39.241 --> 01:23:42.741
Mrs. Bagchi, quickly do whatever you want to do

01:24:17.491 --> 01:24:22.491
Come on, pick up the phone.

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:24.991
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up please. - Rana, just a minute.

01:24:25.491 --> 01:24:28.991
I am almost there.

01:24:32.282 --> 01:24:35.782
"With my vagabond heart..."

01:24:38.866 --> 01:24:42.241
Mrs. Bagchi, what is happening?

01:24:42.741 --> 01:24:44.741
Sapna was right, there are many layers of protection.

01:24:45.241 --> 01:24:48.741
It will take a little time.

01:24:51.532 --> 01:24:56.907
Mrs. Bagchi, why is it taking you so long to check an IP address?

01:24:57.407 --> 01:24:59.282
Rana! Rana! IP address.

01:24:59.782 --> 01:25:00.449
It's the same IP address.

01:25:00.949 --> 01:25:05.324
Mr. Briefcase. We've nailed him. - Are you sure? - Of course.

01:25:05.824 --> 01:25:06.824
Guard! Guard!

01:25:07.324 --> 01:25:08.616
Why are you sleeping? Get up. - Yes.

01:25:09.116 --> 01:25:12.866
Was someone here with Sapna madam? - A man and a woman.

01:25:13.366 --> 01:25:15.074
Oh no. Close all doors.

01:25:15.574 --> 01:25:19.074
Don't let anyone go out. - Yes, sir.

01:25:30.199 --> 01:25:33.699
Did anyone come down? - No, sir.

01:25:38.282 --> 01:25:40.657
Yes, sir. - At the back, where people smoke cigarette..

01:25:41.157 --> 01:25:44.657
..is the door open? - Yes, sir.

01:25:48.741 --> 01:25:49.491
Come.

01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:53.491
We came out at the right time.

01:26:30.699 --> 01:26:31.657
Oh no.

01:26:32.157 --> 01:26:35.657
Mrs. Bagchi, come quickly.

01:26:39.157 --> 01:26:39.824
Hello.

01:26:40.324 --> 01:26:40.866
Yes. But he is following yes.

01:26:41.366 --> 01:26:44.532
What happened? Who are you calling?

01:26:45.032 --> 01:26:46.282
Please come quickly, sir. We need help.

01:26:46.782 --> 01:26:47.657
What happened?

01:26:48.157 --> 01:26:50.157
I had to call Khan sir. - Khan?

01:26:50.657 --> 01:26:54.157
Sorry. Shridhar is right behind us.

01:27:05.949 --> 01:27:09.449
What did you take from my computer?

01:27:19.657 --> 01:27:20.449
Gun.

01:27:20.949 --> 01:27:24.449
Where is my gun?

01:27:33.699 --> 01:27:33.741
Come.

01:27:34.241 --> 01:27:35.407
Let's go, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:27:35.907 --> 01:27:39.282
Rana, bag.

01:27:39.782 --> 01:27:41.574
Stop it. - Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:27:42.074 --> 01:27:45.574
We want this man alive.

01:27:51.824 --> 01:27:55.366
No, no, no. this man can't die.

01:27:55.866 --> 01:27:56.282
Oh no.

01:27:56.782 --> 01:27:59.032
We wanted this man alive.

01:27:59.532 --> 01:28:00.782
Why didn't you call me earlier?

01:28:01.282 --> 01:28:04.782
How will we catch Milan now?

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:11.991
How will we catch Milan without him?

01:28:12.491 --> 01:28:15.449
Take him to the hospital.

01:28:15.949 --> 01:28:19.782
Rana works for me.

01:28:20.282 --> 01:28:22.657
Mrs. Bagchi, do you remember what I said.

01:28:23.157 --> 01:28:26.241
We've been looking for Milan for the past two years

01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:30.616
And we had this last option to find him.

01:28:31.116 --> 01:28:33.532
You. You could do what we couldn't.

01:28:34.032 --> 01:28:37.866
But you ruined the entire plan.

01:28:38.366 --> 01:28:41.949
Actually, Mrs. Bagchi, there's someone in the organization..

01:28:42.449 --> 01:28:44.532
..who is helping Milan.

01:28:45.032 --> 01:28:48.491
Mr. Khan couldn't reopen the case himself.

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:51.282
So he asked for my help.

01:28:51.782 --> 01:28:54.824
..so that we can find Milan through you.

01:28:55.324 --> 01:28:57.032
'Do you love your job? - Yes, sir.'

01:28:57.532 --> 01:29:01.032
'From today you will work for me.'

01:29:02.949 --> 01:29:03.824
Why me?

01:29:04.324 --> 01:29:06.366
Because no one's scared of a pregnant woman.

01:29:06.866 --> 01:29:08.407
Especially, when her husband has run away.

01:29:08.907 --> 01:29:10.282
No one would've doubted.

01:29:10.782 --> 01:29:14.949
But, Mrs. Bagchi, only because of you..

01:29:15.449 --> 01:29:18.991
..we could find out that Milan is responsible for Vijay's death too.

01:29:19.491 --> 01:29:24.116
And we could reach Shridhar only because of you, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:29:24.616 --> 01:29:31.824
You...were using me. - Yes.

01:29:32.324 --> 01:29:36.366
Your case was revived only because of me..

01:29:36.866 --> 01:29:38.449
..because Arnab looks just like Milan.

01:29:38.949 --> 01:29:41.407
But we don't have time for.. - And Agnes?

01:29:41.907 --> 01:29:44.116
Dr. Ganguly? - Collateral damage.

01:29:44.616 --> 01:29:45.949
One needs to make small sacrifices in big battles..

01:29:46.449 --> 01:29:47.032
..what's the big deal?

01:29:47.532 --> 01:29:49.366
And me? My child?

01:29:49.866 --> 01:29:52.616
Nothing would've happened to you.

01:29:53.116 --> 01:29:54.074
I wouldn't have allowed it.

01:29:54.574 --> 01:29:58.074
I took up this assignment only because of you.

01:30:04.282 --> 01:30:06.616
Mrs. Bagchi, we wanted Shridhar alive.

01:30:07.116 --> 01:30:08.282
He was the only one who could've lead us..

01:30:08.782 --> 01:30:11.116
..to the man who is helping Milan from within the system.

01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:12.407
Listen to me carefully.

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.116
We have one last option.

01:30:14.616 --> 01:30:16.616
You have hacked Shridhar's computer.

01:30:17.116 --> 01:30:19.574
Do it again. We might find a clue.

01:30:20.074 --> 01:30:21.324
Why should I help you?

01:30:21.824 --> 01:30:24.741
I am not asking for your help, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:30:25.241 --> 01:30:25.782
I am telling you.

01:30:26.282 --> 01:30:29.782
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

01:31:02.949 --> 01:31:05.074
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:05.574 --> 01:31:08.282
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:08.782 --> 01:31:12.282
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:22.241 --> 01:31:26.032
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:31:26.532 --> 01:31:30.366
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:31:30.866 --> 01:31:37.157
"Walk alone."

01:31:37.657 --> 01:31:44.032
"Walk alone."

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.657
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:47.157 --> 01:31:49.907
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:31:50.407 --> 01:31:53.907
"Glory to... - Goddess Durga!"

01:32:29.366 --> 01:32:32.866
Bishnu!

01:32:47.907 --> 01:32:54.907
"If no one hears your call..."

01:32:55.407 --> 01:32:58.907
"Walk alone."

01:33:03.699 --> 01:33:09.616
"If no one hears your call..."

01:33:10.116 --> 01:33:14.574
"Walk alone."

01:33:15.074 --> 01:33:18.574
"Walk alone."

01:33:37.032 --> 01:33:40.532
Mr. Khan.

01:33:44.991 --> 01:33:47.532
This is the only code that
I don't understand.

01:33:48.032 --> 01:33:48.949
Rest of the computer is clean.

01:33:49.449 --> 01:33:51.407
CXWWEDFXZS.

01:33:51.907 --> 01:33:55.407
Is that all you found?

01:34:18.532 --> 01:34:22.782
Rana. What happened?

01:34:23.282 --> 01:34:26.032
No. I don't know.

01:34:26.532 --> 01:34:30.032
What can it be?

01:34:34.199 --> 01:34:34.949
Give me your phone, sir.

01:34:35.449 --> 01:34:38.949
CXWWEDFXZS.

01:34:44.449 --> 01:34:47.949
Sir, I feel this is a mobile number.

01:34:51.241 --> 01:34:54.907
This is Bhaskaran's number.

01:34:55.407 --> 01:34:57.366
What the..

01:34:57.866 --> 01:35:00.532
Mrs. Bagchi. You will have to do one last thing for me.

01:35:01.032 --> 01:35:04.157
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:35:04.657 --> 01:35:05.866
Are you listening?

01:35:06.366 --> 01:35:09.866
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:35:11.282 --> 01:35:12.741
Call Bhaskaran.

01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:13.866
And lie to him that..

01:35:14.366 --> 01:35:16.991
..you found some data about him on Shridhar's computer?

01:35:17.491 --> 01:35:18.491
Why should I do that?

01:35:18.991 --> 01:35:20.907
Because Bhaskaran is the last resort..

01:35:21.407 --> 01:35:24.907
..to find Arnab and Milan.

01:35:31.407 --> 01:35:34.282
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:35:34.782 --> 01:35:38.199
I was harsh with you every time.

01:35:38.699 --> 01:35:42.199
This time it's a request, so..

01:35:47.407 --> 01:35:50.907
Please help me.

01:35:54.532 --> 01:35:56.407
Mr. Bhaskaran. - Yes.

01:35:56.907 --> 01:35:57.366
Who is this?

01:35:57.866 --> 01:35:59.449
This is Vidya Bagchi speaking.

01:35:59.949 --> 01:36:00.991
Where did you get my number from?

01:36:01.491 --> 01:36:03.407
From Shriddhar's computer.

01:36:03.907 --> 01:36:06.282
I have found some more papers in your name.
- So?

01:36:06.782 --> 01:36:10.991
Look, I don't care about who you are or what you do.

01:36:11.491 --> 01:36:13.032
I will return all your papers..

01:36:13.532 --> 01:36:17.699
..in return I want government help
to help me find my husband.

01:36:18.199 --> 01:36:20.824
Look, I don't know why you are calling me.

01:36:21.324 --> 01:36:22.574
I will inform my local office.

01:36:23.074 --> 01:36:26.574
Contact him.

01:36:35.949 --> 01:36:39.449
Now?

01:36:45.407 --> 01:36:46.241
If you want to see your husband alive..

01:36:46.741 --> 01:36:50.241
..then wait for my call.

01:36:53.949 --> 01:36:57.449
Milan Damji.

01:36:59.324 --> 01:37:03.991
Yes, I need a big brown envelope.

01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:07.991
Okay.

01:37:13.699 --> 01:37:17.199
Hello.

01:37:28.741 --> 01:37:32.241
How are you? - Fine.

01:37:35.866 --> 01:37:37.991
I had to make a promise.

01:37:38.491 --> 01:37:44.407
But before that, this is for you.

01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:48.407
Today's the last day of the veneration.

01:37:54.782 --> 01:37:57.449
I cannot take this.
- No, no, no, Mrs. Bagchi, this..

01:37:57.949 --> 01:38:00.824
I still have the receipt.

01:38:01.324 --> 01:38:04.157
I wanted to promise you that..

01:38:04.657 --> 01:38:07.491
..I will help you in finding Arnab.

01:38:07.991 --> 01:38:13.991
And when we find him,
I will make him pay for this sari.

01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:17.991
This is from Arnab, not me.

01:38:21.074 --> 01:38:22.741
I am sorry, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:38:23.241 --> 01:38:26.741
I am really very sorry.

01:38:35.032 --> 01:38:39.032
Thank you.

01:38:39.532 --> 01:38:43.032
Sorry.

01:38:44.991 --> 01:38:46.824
Paras Pal.

01:38:47.324 --> 01:38:47.782
Yes, Paras.

01:38:48.282 --> 01:38:50.116
You were asking about Milan Damji, weren't you?

01:38:50.616 --> 01:38:51.532
Yes, did you find out anything?

01:38:52.032 --> 01:38:54.199
The news is that he
has returned to Kolkata.

01:38:54.699 --> 01:38:57.282
Wow. Then Khan sir's plan is working.

01:38:57.782 --> 01:38:59.991
Only Milan can come see Vidya.

01:39:00.491 --> 01:39:01.949
Bhaskaran doesn't have any other option.

01:39:02.449 --> 01:39:04.282
Vidya? - Yes.

01:39:04.782 --> 01:39:06.782
As soon as Milan comes to
see her, he will be caught.

01:39:07.282 --> 01:39:09.616
You want to sacrifice a helpless girl?

01:39:10.116 --> 01:39:11.699
No, no, no, this isn't my plan.

01:39:12.199 --> 01:39:13.199
This is Khan sir's plan.

01:39:13.699 --> 01:39:17.991
And Mrs. Bagchi..

01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:18.866
Move.

01:39:19.366 --> 01:39:20.491
Call him up. - Sir, sir.

01:39:20.991 --> 01:39:21.116
Sir, I am sorry.

01:39:21.616 --> 01:39:22.407
Just a minute. - I was saying..

01:39:22.907 --> 01:39:24.741
We will have to stop this operation at any cost, sir.
- Yes.

01:39:25.241 --> 01:39:27.866
If Milan meets Mrs. Bagchi, then her life is in danger.

01:39:28.366 --> 01:39:29.491
So?
- You didn't understand, sir.

01:39:29.991 --> 01:39:31.074
Milan never leaves behind any eye-witness.

01:39:31.574 --> 01:39:32.699
He will do the same this time as well.

01:39:33.199 --> 01:39:37.866
So, we will try to save your Mrs. Bagchi.

01:39:38.366 --> 01:39:39.574
You know, sir.

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:42.532
You know, yet you are.. - Sacrificing her.

01:39:43.032 --> 01:39:43.866
This is wrong.

01:39:44.366 --> 01:39:45.282
You are intentionally.. - Shut up.

01:39:45.782 --> 01:39:47.157
You want to teach me right and wrong.

01:39:47.657 --> 01:39:48.907
My job is to protect the country..

01:39:49.407 --> 01:39:51.741
..and anything I do for that is right.

01:39:52.241 --> 01:39:55.449
If I have to sacrifice Vidya Bagchi to catch Milan Damji..

01:39:55.949 --> 01:39:56.324
..then that's right too.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.616
Then what is the difference between us and Milan, sir?

01:39:59.116 --> 01:40:00.991
There's no difference.

01:40:01.491 --> 01:40:03.616
We do it for the law and he does it against it.

01:40:04.116 --> 01:40:08.324
So we are right and he's wrong.

01:40:08.824 --> 01:40:09.866
Love is a good thing, Rana.

01:40:10.366 --> 01:40:12.282
But learn to use it at the right place.

01:40:12.782 --> 01:40:13.324
Meaning?

01:40:13.824 --> 01:40:18.366
Your love that's telling you "Go tell Vidya Bagchi about Khan".

01:40:18.866 --> 01:40:20.157
That's wrong.

01:40:20.657 --> 01:40:21.824
This way you can save only one life..

01:40:22.324 --> 01:40:25.574
..but what about thousands of lives that Milan will take?

01:40:26.074 --> 01:40:27.491
I wasn't going to tell her, sir, but..

01:40:27.991 --> 01:40:29.616
Rajveer, take his mobile.

01:40:30.116 --> 01:40:31.032
Don't let him go anywhere.

01:40:31.532 --> 01:40:33.741
Not even to the bathroom.

01:40:34.241 --> 01:40:37.491
No, sir. Nothing important.

01:40:37.991 --> 01:40:41.491
Yes, so what were you saying?

01:41:42.199 --> 01:41:43.449
Sister Bidya.

01:41:43.949 --> 01:41:47.991
Sister Bidya.

01:41:48.491 --> 01:41:51.991
Keep it.

01:42:03.366 --> 01:42:06.866
Sister.

01:42:26.366 --> 01:42:27.699
You are Sharma, aren't you? - Yes, why?

01:42:28.199 --> 01:42:28.741
Khan sir is calling you.

01:42:29.241 --> 01:42:32.366
Where? - In the AC.. OC chamber.

01:42:32.866 --> 01:42:33.699
You go.

01:42:34.199 --> 01:42:36.657
And he has asked me to sit here.

01:42:37.157 --> 01:42:40.657
I will keep a watch on him.

01:42:44.074 --> 01:42:45.782
Rana. Go.

01:42:46.282 --> 01:42:47.782
Go, go. - What about you?

01:42:48.282 --> 01:42:51.782
I will handle it here. Go.
- Thank you, Chatterjee.

01:42:54.741 --> 01:42:55.199
Rana. - Yes.

01:42:55.699 --> 01:42:59.199
Where are you going? - I'll be right back.

01:43:08.699 --> 01:43:12.199
Hello.

01:43:13.866 --> 01:43:18.116
Triangular Park?

01:43:18.616 --> 01:43:19.491
Hello.

01:43:19.991 --> 01:43:21.116
Triangular Park. Triangular Park.

01:43:21.616 --> 01:43:23.074
Get lost.

01:43:23.574 --> 01:43:24.532
Sir, where is Rana? - To hell with him.

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.449
Come on. - Okay, sir.

01:43:26.949 --> 01:43:27.741
Rajveer, follow us.

01:43:28.241 --> 01:43:28.782
Come on, hurry up.

01:43:29.282 --> 01:43:32.782
Come on, come on, hurry up.

01:43:36.741 --> 01:43:37.407
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

01:43:37.907 --> 01:43:38.741
She paid her dues and left.

01:43:39.241 --> 01:43:40.824
Where did she go?
- Sister went to Triangular Park.

01:43:41.324 --> 01:43:44.824
Triangular Park.

01:45:07.324 --> 01:45:10.824
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:46:15.824 --> 01:46:19.324
Take a left from here, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:46:44.782 --> 01:46:47.657
Mrs. Bagchi.

01:46:48.157 --> 01:46:51.532
Where are the files? - Who are you?

01:46:52.032 --> 01:46:53.907
What difference does it make?

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:56.324
Files.

01:46:56.824 --> 01:47:01.199
Milan Damji...
who was just a story until now.

01:47:01.699 --> 01:47:03.991
I have very little time, Mrs. Bagchi.

01:47:04.491 --> 01:47:08.282
If you want your husband back... Files.

01:47:08.782 --> 01:47:10.366
If I return the papers then..

01:47:10.866 --> 01:47:12.741
..will you return me my husband? - Yes.

01:47:13.241 --> 01:47:16.741
Files.

01:47:18.824 --> 01:47:21.199
Can you return him?

01:47:21.699 --> 01:47:25.199
Think about it.

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:41.782
Who are you?

01:49:42.282 --> 01:49:45.782
What difference does it make?

01:49:57.074 --> 01:50:00.574
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

01:50:10.366 --> 01:50:11.574
Catch her.

01:50:12.074 --> 01:50:14.407
Check him. Check him.

01:50:14.907 --> 01:50:17.699
Catch her. She's wearing a white sari.

01:50:18.199 --> 01:50:19.241
I said she's wearing a white sari.

01:50:19.741 --> 01:50:23.241
Are you blind?

01:51:20.366 --> 01:51:21.366
Who was Mrs. Bagchi?

01:51:21.866 --> 01:51:26.657
Vidya Bagchi was a story, sir?
- Meaning?

01:51:27.157 --> 01:51:27.366
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

01:51:27.866 --> 01:51:28.782
'Sister went to Triangular Park.'

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:32.782
'Triangular Park.'

01:51:37.324 --> 01:51:40.741
'This is a flying swan.'

01:51:41.241 --> 01:51:41.907
'Where did you find this uniform?'

01:51:42.407 --> 01:51:44.574
'This? It's my school uniform.'

01:51:45.074 --> 01:51:46.699
'Back when I lived in Thakurpukur.'

01:51:47.199 --> 01:51:50.032
'Any uncle. Anyone.'

01:51:50.532 --> 01:51:52.366
'He has an uncle,
who lives in Thakurpukur.'

01:51:52.866 --> 01:51:53.866
'Did you ever tell
sister Vidya about this?'

01:51:54.366 --> 01:51:56.116
'Yes, when we met for the first time.'

01:51:56.616 --> 01:52:00.116
'I have heard many stories about it.'

01:52:03.907 --> 01:52:05.366
Check her hotel room and her finger prints.

01:52:05.866 --> 01:52:06.699
It's of no use, sir.

01:52:07.199 --> 01:52:10.324
'Why are you cleaning it yourself?'

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:11.032
What?

01:52:11.532 --> 01:52:13.324
'Just one sign and then you can leave.'

01:52:13.824 --> 01:52:15.782
'Sign here. - Here.'

01:52:16.282 --> 01:52:18.074
And her husband, Arnab?

01:52:18.574 --> 01:52:20.574
Oh, so you haven't understood yet, sir.

01:52:21.074 --> 01:52:21.157
What?

01:52:21.657 --> 01:52:23.157
'In the beginning, you told her a story.'

01:52:23.657 --> 01:52:24.991
'There was never anyone called Milan.'

01:52:25.491 --> 01:52:25.949
Yes, so?

01:52:26.449 --> 01:52:27.824
And even she told us a story.

01:52:28.324 --> 01:52:29.491
'My husband is missing.'

01:52:29.991 --> 01:52:31.491
'Arnab Bagchi didn't stay here.'
- 'No, dear.'

01:52:31.991 --> 01:52:33.532
'He didn't leave London or land in Kolkata.'

01:52:34.032 --> 01:52:35.032
Milan was for real, sir.

01:52:35.532 --> 01:52:38.491
But there is no Vidya Bagchi nor Arnab..

01:52:38.991 --> 01:52:39.491
..who looks like Milan.

01:52:39.991 --> 01:52:41.074
'Arnab didn't like to get his picture taken.'

01:52:41.574 --> 01:52:42.949
'Until Agnes didn't see Arnab's photo properly.'

01:52:43.449 --> 01:52:46.991
'And the day we find Milan, we will find Arnab.'

01:52:47.491 --> 01:52:50.616
What the..

01:52:51.116 --> 01:52:52.616
That means until now.. - Correct.

01:52:53.116 --> 01:52:55.074
She kept using us.

01:52:55.574 --> 01:52:57.282
Sir, it seems like Vidya Bagchi was hired..

01:52:57.782 --> 01:52:59.824
..to find and kill Milan Damji.

01:53:00.324 --> 01:53:02.991
And she used us to find Milan.

01:53:03.491 --> 01:53:05.657
She wanted us to use her as a scapegoat..

01:53:06.157 --> 01:53:07.699
..to find Milan Damji.

01:53:08.199 --> 01:53:09.907
And before we could arrest Shridhar.

01:53:10.407 --> 01:53:11.574
Vidya killed her as well.

01:53:12.074 --> 01:53:15.116
Sir, you gave Bhaskaran and
Milan to her yourself.

01:53:15.616 --> 01:53:16.074
She knew.

01:53:16.574 --> 01:53:20.449
'No one doubts a pregnant woman.'

01:53:20.949 --> 01:53:24.449
You wanted evidence against
Bhaskaran didn't you?

01:53:27.074 --> 01:53:28.241
'What did you take from my computer?'

01:53:28.741 --> 01:53:31.616
Here it is.

01:53:32.116 --> 01:53:33.657
Who is Satyaki?

01:53:34.157 --> 01:53:37.657
'Arjun's charioteer.'

01:53:40.074 --> 01:53:40.949
That's me, sir.

01:53:41.449 --> 01:53:44.032
My name is Satyaki.

01:53:44.532 --> 01:53:45.949
But who sent her?

01:53:46.449 --> 01:53:49.949
And why did she help us?

01:54:10.824 --> 01:54:14.324
Here.

01:54:18.282 --> 01:54:19.199
I don't want to go to Kolkata.

01:54:19.699 --> 01:54:20.616
Go.

01:54:21.116 --> 01:54:23.282
If I go to Kolkata,
I'll get it for you too Mrs. Basu.

01:54:23.782 --> 01:54:27.282
What?

01:54:28.824 --> 01:54:32.324
And what if I don't return.

01:54:39.032 --> 01:54:42.532
'Arup.'

01:54:44.532 --> 01:54:48.032
'Sorry, we couldn't save your child.'

01:54:56.324 --> 01:55:02.532
'Arup took up this assignment
only because of me.'

01:55:03.032 --> 01:55:06.532
'It's completely my fault.'

01:55:26.532 --> 01:55:30.241
Arup must be really happy today, Vidya.

01:55:30.741 --> 01:55:34.282
He must be proud of you.

01:55:34.782 --> 01:55:36.991
Because today you have accomplished..

01:55:37.491 --> 01:55:40.991
..what we all couldn't.

01:55:42.324 --> 01:55:45.199
You want to know a strange thing, Colonel.

01:55:45.699 --> 01:55:47.574
In the last few days..

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:51.741
..I completely forgot that I am not pregnant.

01:55:52.241 --> 01:55:55.741
It felt like...
my child is still alive inside me.

01:56:01.407 --> 01:56:04.907
It felt like...I might find Arup as well.

01:56:10.824 --> 01:56:13.907
I cannot live without them, Colonel.

01:56:14.407 --> 01:56:18.032
I want my Arup back.

01:56:18.532 --> 01:56:22.032
I want my child back.

01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:37.324
'Today, two years later.'

01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:40.657
'The family of those killed
in the Metro attack..'

01:56:41.157 --> 01:56:44.657
'..have finally got an answer.'

01:56:50.032 --> 01:56:53.282
'Sometimes even God's make mistakes.'

01:56:53.782 --> 01:56:55.116
'Gods created demons.'

01:56:55.616 --> 01:56:57.449
'Bestowed them with power.'

01:56:57.949 --> 01:57:01.491
'But when they started abusing that power..

01:57:01.991 --> 01:57:04.866
..Gods created Mother Durga.'

01:57:05.366 --> 01:57:10.282
'To annihilate the demons.'

01:57:10.782 --> 01:57:13.866
'It's said that Mother Durga..

01:57:14.366 --> 01:57:16.991
..was created by gathering
the strength of all the Goddess's.'

01:57:17.491 --> 01:57:19.407
'Every year Mother graces
us with her presence.'

01:57:19.907 --> 01:57:22.032
'Eliminates evil.'

01:57:22.532 --> 01:57:26.032
'And goes back.'

01:57:33.866 --> 01:57:38.907
'So that all of us can live
happily and peacefully..

01:57:39.407 --> 01:57:42.907
..without any fear.'

01:58:49.657 --> 01:58:57.366
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:58:57.866 --> 01:59:05.991
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:12.824
"Walk alone."

01:59:13.324 --> 01:59:17.366
"Walk alone."

01:59:17.866 --> 01:59:21.366
"Walk alone."

01:59:51.491 --> 01:59:59.157
"If no one talks to you, you unlucky.."

01:59:59.657 --> 02:00:04.616
"If everyone turns their back on 
you, and everyone fears you."

02:00:05.116 --> 02:00:10.028
"If everyone turns their back on 
you, and everyone fears you."

02:00:10.767 --> 02:00:18.373
"Speak your heart alone."

02:00:18.813 --> 02:00:28.950
"Speak your heart loud and clear."

02:00:29.261 --> 02:00:37.466
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."

02:01:18.834 --> 02:01:26.584
"If you're surrounded by a fog. And the 
darkness swallows the light."

02:01:27.084 --> 02:01:32.001
"When the world bows 
before fear."

02:01:32.501 --> 02:01:37.501
"When the world bows 
before fear."

02:01:38.001 --> 02:01:42.917
"Be the flame..."

02:01:43.417 --> 02:01:48.792
"Be the flame...
that burns to lighten the world."

02:01:49.292 --> 02:01:50.876
"Burn alone."

02:01:51.376 --> 02:01:56.126
"Be the flame...that burns to
lighten the world. Burn alone."

02:01:56.626 --> 02:02:04.251
"If no one hears your call... walk alone."
