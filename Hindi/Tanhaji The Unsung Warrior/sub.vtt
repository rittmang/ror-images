00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:25.826
India!

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.201
A Golden bird.

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:34.409
However, many external invasions
shattered the soul of that bird..

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:52.034
Remember Tanhaji!

00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:55.576
The warrior who makes his own sword..

00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:59.701
..he trusts the sword
more than anything.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.534
Look Tanhya..

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.742
If you wield a sword,
wield it like lighting.

00:04:09.492 --> 00:04:12.242
If you want to travel
then ride the storm.

00:04:15.992 --> 00:04:18.909
If you want to challenge
then challenge as high as the sun.

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.409
What will you do now, Tanhya?

00:04:40.492 --> 00:04:42.867
Even your shield has
a sharp edge to it Tanhya.

00:04:49.193 --> 00:04:51.701
Blood was flowing like water.

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:53.617
Courage was shattered.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:54.576
What is this sound, Father?

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.367
- It is time to go to war, Tanhya! - Nevertheless,
there were few fighters for freedom..

00:04:57.451 --> 00:04:58.951
..Who were sharpening their courage.

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:01.159
I will come with you.

00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:02.117
No Tanhya..

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.284
Take care of your mother and Surya.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.117
Eyes filled with despair,

00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:10.409
- Every breath was bursting of fear.
- Glory to Mahadev!

00:05:10.492 --> 00:05:12.951
As if, people were
offenders on their own land.

00:05:13.034 --> 00:05:16.576
If you don't pay tax,
give up your religion,

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.409
If not your religion..

00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:19.826
..then you will have
to sacrifice your life.

00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:21.659
Glory to Mahadev!

00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:41.617
War requires bravery..not weapons..

00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:48.742
An army is not needed, courage is.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.992
One who is not afraid of losing..

00:05:54.784 --> 00:05:57.534
..victory is not far away from him..

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:05.742
Father.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.617
Father.

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:11.201
Father.

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:20.867
You are my pillar of strength Tanhaji.

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:24.409
People leave behind many possessions.

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.576
I am leaving you behind with a debt.

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:29.951
'The Freedom of our Motherland.'

00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:52.617
Glory to..Mahadev!

00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.326
Father!

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:56.326
Father!

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.992
An empire of darkness
spread in every direction.

00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:05.951
Despair had crossed all limits.

00:07:06.617 --> 00:07:07.909
And at that time,

00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:12.701
A ray of hope was born
over the western hills of India.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:17.784
His name was Shivaji Shahaji Bhosle.

00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:20.992
Now Shivaji was the
strength of his people.

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:23.701
And his strength were
his companions..his chiefs..

00:07:23.784 --> 00:07:25.242
Baji Prabhu Deshpande,

00:07:25.326 --> 00:07:26.451
Yesaji Kank,

00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:28.242
Dadasaheb Narasprabhu,

00:07:28.326 --> 00:07:29.617
Noor Khan Beig,

00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:32.076
And his most favourite among them,

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:33.784
His right hand man.

00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:36.284
Born in Konkan's red soil,
From umrath.

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.784
Brave Maratha..

00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:40.409
Tanhaji Malusare.

00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:41.671
'Religion created the faith.'

00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:43.884
'Training inculcated bravery.'

00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:46.759
The Marathas began to slash
away at the Mughal empire..

00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:48.909
..with their sharp edged swords.

00:11:49.617 --> 00:11:53.867
Soon Swaraj started blooming
with the victory of 40 forts.

00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:57.409
Delhi could not bear
this victory of the Marathas.

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:01.076
The saffron (Maratha
flag) caught Alamgir's eyes.

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:04.659
Mirza Raje Jai Singh is here!

00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:11.867
Glory to the Mughal Empire!

00:12:13.284 --> 00:12:14.617
Mirza Raje!

00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:19.826
If a rat is destroying the
Mughal flag in front of your eyes..

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:21.367
..then what will you do?

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:24.117
Kill him, Aalijaah.

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:29.242
Then shrewd Alamgir executed
his most vicious plan.

00:12:29.701 --> 00:12:32.451
Pitting a Hindu against another Hindu.

00:12:32.784 --> 00:12:34.326
Mirza Raje Jai Singh.

00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:37.326
As if a reliable elephant
riding on another elephant.

00:12:38.242 --> 00:12:40.201
With an army of 80,000 soldiers..

00:12:40.284 --> 00:12:42.201
..Mirza Raje reached Deccan.

00:12:43.076 --> 00:12:45.242
On one end,
there was the storm of Mughals..

00:12:45.534 --> 00:12:47.867
..and on the other end
were only a handful of Marathas.

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:51.659
For the first time,
Swaraj seemed in trouble.

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:57.617
Mirza Raje surrounded the forts
of the Marathas as soon as he arrived.

00:12:57.992 --> 00:13:01.826
Torna, Purandar, Tikona and Kondhana.

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:05.534
And at that time, atop Kondhana
was situated, the mother of Swaraj.

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:06.784
Jijau..

00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:08.867
..AKA Aau Saheb.

00:13:09.826 --> 00:13:11.117
O Goddess Bhawani..

00:13:11.784 --> 00:13:12.992
Mother of this world..

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:14.867
Destroyer of sorrows..

00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:16.617
Goddess of power..

00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:18.576
Now you will only tell..

00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:21.076
..whether Swaraj will prevail,

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.992
or perish by the
hands of these monsters?

00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:26.909
The future of Swaraj was uncertain.

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:29.909
There were more swords
made than soldiers.

00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:32.951
Neither the Mughals
nor Marathas backed down.

00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:35.451
His cannons can never reach Kondhana.

00:13:35.534 --> 00:13:36.701
Till when?

00:13:37.326 --> 00:13:39.117
No matter how strong the fort is...

00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:43.034
it is vulnerable without reserves.

00:13:49.784 --> 00:13:52.076
When the enemy can't be defeated,

00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:55.326
And defeat is unacceptable...

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:57.992
then there is only one option.

00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:00.367
Settlement.

00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:03.326
Send a letter to Mirza Raje.

00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:05.492
Tell him, I will come personally.

00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:10.826
'Setting foot in the Mughal
Camp was like inviting death.'

00:14:10.909 --> 00:14:14.742
But where did the warriors
of Swaraj care for their life?

00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:21.367
Brother.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.242
There is a bad news, brother.

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:32.409
23 forts of Swaraj are
now under Aurangzeb's reign..

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:35.826
..including Kondhana.

00:14:37.617 --> 00:14:40.992
Not only did the Marathas
lose Kondhana in Purandar treaty..

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:43.867
And, Shivaji Raje has
been arrested in Agra.

00:14:44.409 --> 00:14:48.367
Swaraj had lost its power and pride.

00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:54.518
Kondhana was Swaraj's pride..

00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:56.789
..and their eyes in the South.

00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:01.034
Capturing Kondhana meant taking
over the entire Southern India.

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:02.909
Where are your manners?

00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:06.326
We have not handed
this fort over to you yet.

00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:08.201
Hand it over now then.

00:15:08.776 --> 00:15:11.443
An opportunity to spoil
the mood is very rare.

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:13.867
And, we Mughals are
opportunity seekers.

00:15:15.938 --> 00:15:22.813
Your Shivaji Raje has handed
over 23 Forts to our Emperor.

00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:26.159
Which includes Kondhana as well.

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:33.512
Once Aau Saheb (mother)
finishes her prayer..

00:15:34.647 --> 00:15:36.980
..then Kodhana will
be handed over to you.

00:15:37.201 --> 00:15:41.242
Right now, Beshaq Khan can grant only
one permission to your Aau Saheba.

00:15:43.696 --> 00:15:45.196
To leave this fort alive.

00:15:45.328 --> 00:15:46.412
Beshaq Khan!

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.279
Don't forget that you are
speaking with Shivaji Raje's mother.

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.992
A single incorrect word
now and there will be bloodshed.

00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:57.701
Wait, Pratap Rao.

00:16:04.992 --> 00:16:07.284
We shall respect the treaty.

00:16:08.074 --> 00:16:10.157
Aau Saheba is sensible..

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:13.071
..and helpless too.

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:16.451
Take off all the saffron flags.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:21.643
Now the Mughal empire's flag will
wave at every bastion of the fort.

00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:24.347
- Long live..
- Mogul Empire..

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:28.034
- Long live..
- The Emperor..

00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:30.826
- Long live..
- Mogul Empire..

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:33.826
- Long live..
- The Emperor..

00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:36.441
Congratulation!

00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:41.959
However, I am happy to see that
the colour of the treaty is saffron.

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:46.549
Keep it safe.

00:16:47.853 --> 00:16:50.644
Aau Saheba, wear your shoes.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:54.137
The heat is strong
and your feet are fragile.

00:16:55.492 --> 00:16:57.826
Along with your emotions,
your feet will also be scorched.

00:16:57.869 --> 00:16:59.411
No Beshaq Khan..

00:17:00.074 --> 00:17:02.907
Until the saffron (Maratha
flag) is waving over Kondhana again..

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.950
..I shall remain barefoot.

00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:09.808
Along with the fort, consider
these shoes as a gift for Mughals.

00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:20.375
I shall wait for your call,
Goddess Bhawani..

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.056
Four years passed.

00:17:27.245 --> 00:17:30.786
Even today the Mughal
flag waving over Kondhana..

00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:33.778
..kept reminding Jijau
of her humiliation.

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:37.409
Shivaji Raje (King Shivaji)
managed to deceive..

00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:39.826
..the Mughals and returned to Rajgad.

00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:45.367
And at that time, a spy brought news.

00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:48.867
Accept the salutation, Raje.

00:17:50.926 --> 00:17:52.801
From Tarkib Khan to Trimbak Rao.

00:17:53.334 --> 00:17:55.584
You took a huge risk, Trimbak.

00:17:55.813 --> 00:17:57.438
The news is such, Raje.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
The way Delhi is the capital of north.

00:18:00.686 --> 00:18:04.061
Similarly, Alamgir wants Kondhana
to be the capital of the South.

00:18:04.544 --> 00:18:06.752
And for this purpose, he is
sending an army of 2000 soldiers..

00:18:07.277 --> 00:18:10.069
..along with Udaybhan Rathore
as the new commander-in-chief of fort.

00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:13.325
Udaybhan?

00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:17.117
Name does not sound like a Mughal.

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:19.868
Age 35 years.

00:18:20.512 --> 00:18:21.762
He is dangerous..

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.451
Above all,
he has gained Alamgir's trust.

00:18:25.442 --> 00:18:27.901
But Alamgir doesn't even
trust his own reflection.

00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:29.218
That's true, Raje.

00:18:30.037 --> 00:18:32.204
A few month ago,
Shah Pehalvi of Iran..

00:18:32.229 --> 00:18:34.104
..came to Agra as Alamgir's guest.

00:18:35.173 --> 00:18:37.798
Alamgir and Shah Pehalvi
were playing Human chess.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.040
Here we go, Emperor Alamgir!

00:18:42.306 --> 00:18:44.848
This is my horse's move.

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:52.728
You forgot my pawn, Shah Pahalvi.

00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:54.624
Make your move.

00:18:59.147 --> 00:19:01.689
This is the move of my pawn.

00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:49.201
My elephant will crush your pawn.

00:20:43.277 --> 00:20:46.027
Delighted with Udaybhan's
ferocious bravery..

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:49.201
..the emperor made him
one of his royal bodyguards.

00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:51.722
And one night..

00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:05.930
Your highness.

00:22:06.597 --> 00:22:09.055
Present Udaybhan in the royal court.

00:22:09.722 --> 00:22:11.222
As you wish, your highness.

00:22:39.097 --> 00:22:40.680
Why did you stop?

00:23:05.847 --> 00:23:09.597
I intend to rule over all of India.

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:14.889
I desire to capture
the entire southern region.

00:23:16.347 --> 00:23:23.639
And I wish to see you emerge
victorious by leading this mission.

00:23:24.972 --> 00:23:28.805
The way Delhi is the
capital of northern India.

00:23:29.722 --> 00:23:33.722
Similarly.. Kondhana will
be the capital of southern India.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.722
I am extremely happy
with your bravery and Loyalty.

00:23:44.514 --> 00:23:48.972
That is why I am appointing you
as a commander-in-chief of Kondhana.

00:23:54.222 --> 00:23:56.972
And from that day onwards,
a pawn became the commander-in-chief.

00:23:57.472 --> 00:23:58.680
He is a human..

00:23:59.347 --> 00:24:00.389
..not a devil.

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.305
But no less than a devil.

00:24:03.555 --> 00:24:09.139
Now, that devil has a Nagin(Serpent)
and the reed pipe to control it.

00:24:09.222 --> 00:24:12.680
Our concern is not only about
him being more powerful than we are..

00:24:12.722 --> 00:24:14.764
..or he has an army of 2000 soldiers.

00:24:15.055 --> 00:24:16.514
The matter of concern is..

00:24:16.597 --> 00:24:20.389
..Aurangzeb has sent
a massive cannon with Udaybhan.

00:24:20.514 --> 00:24:23.889
The creator has named it as Nagin.
(Serpent).

00:24:24.972 --> 00:24:27.597
Its range is up to dozens of miles.

00:24:28.514 --> 00:24:33.347
A single blow can destroy
a whole settlement.

00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:36.180
The attack is so powerful..

00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:39.722
..that It can shake the
walls of all the forts in Deccan.

00:24:49.847 --> 00:24:53.597
If the canon succeeds
in reaching Kondhana Fort..

00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:58.472
Then swaraj in India may
forever be a dream, Raje (King).

00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:03.722
You are speaking the
language of defeat, Pisal.

00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:05.514
And naked reality too.

00:25:05.597 --> 00:25:08.680
Somebody should learn how
to lose without fighting from you.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.722
It is not so easy to
conquer Kondhana, Gujar.

00:25:13.847 --> 00:25:15.805
I myself will accomplish this mission.

00:25:20.972 --> 00:25:21.847
No, Raje.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.514
Even if a million people die,
it is okay..

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.805
..but the guardian of
million others should be safe.

00:25:28.722 --> 00:25:30.639
There is one more warrior..

00:25:31.472 --> 00:25:33.639
..who can accomplish this mission.

00:25:35.764 --> 00:25:38.305
Subhedar (Commander) Tanhaji Malusare.

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:42.347
Surely, he is the most trusted ally..

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.680
..but I cannot ask for
his support this time.

00:25:50.139 --> 00:25:51.472
Why not, Raje?

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:54.805
Because when someone's
preparing for his son's wedding..

00:25:55.722 --> 00:25:58.930
..I cannot invite him
for this suicidal mission.

00:26:02.639 --> 00:26:04.805
After so many years,
for the first time..

00:26:05.722 --> 00:26:07.847
..he has an occasion to celebrate.

00:26:52.805 --> 00:26:54.472
"The Bonfire is burning"

00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:56.597
"An enemy turns into ashes"

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.680
"Whenever we wield our swords"

00:26:59.722 --> 00:27:01.389
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:27:07.722 --> 00:27:09.514
"Thousand storms rage"

00:27:09.597 --> 00:27:11.389
"An enemy is destroyed from his roots"

00:27:11.472 --> 00:27:14.264
"Whenever we are determined"

00:27:14.347 --> 00:27:16.055
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:27:22.514 --> 00:27:26.097
"We all are brave and proud warriors"

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.722
"Now every day is a festival of Swaraj"

00:27:29.805 --> 00:27:31.639
"Now this head will not bow"

00:27:31.722 --> 00:27:33.430
"We shall keep your esteem"

00:27:33.514 --> 00:27:36.514
"We take the oath of your name,
Maa Jagdambe (Mother Goddess)"

00:27:36.597 --> 00:27:38.305
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:27:43.889 --> 00:27:45.972
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:28:18.472 --> 00:28:20.264
"The smoke was intense"

00:28:20.347 --> 00:28:22.097
"The darkness was dense"

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.805
"You filled that with light of hope"

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:27.597
"You blessed us with devotion"

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.472
"You blessed us with power"

00:28:29.555 --> 00:28:32.222
"You filled our life with joy"

00:28:32.514 --> 00:28:36.430
"Those who were yearning for years"

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:39.139
"Have smile on their faces"

00:28:39.805 --> 00:28:43.639
"Ambe Mata (Mother Goddess),
by your blessings"

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:46.472
"Happiness has filled my home"

00:28:47.264 --> 00:28:49.180
"We are as solid as arock"

00:28:49.264 --> 00:28:51.055
"We can flow against the stream"

00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:54.097
"Whenever we are determined"

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.722
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:29:02.139 --> 00:29:05.722
"We all are brave and proud warriors"

00:29:05.805 --> 00:29:09.472
"Now every day is a festival of Swaraj"

00:29:09.555 --> 00:29:11.389
"Now this head will not bow"

00:29:11.472 --> 00:29:13.180
"We shall keep your esteem"

00:29:13.264 --> 00:29:16.222
"We take the oath of your name,
Maa Jagdambe (Mother Goddess)"

00:29:16.305 --> 00:29:18.305
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:29:23.722 --> 00:29:25.680
"O Goddess Bhawani!"

00:30:32.472 --> 00:30:33.972
Missing your Father?

00:30:34.722 --> 00:30:37.264
Whenever I touch his sword..

00:30:39.305 --> 00:30:41.805
..I turn into Tanhya from Tanhaji.

00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:44.472
He always used to say..

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.430
I will perform your wedding
in a grand way Tanhya.

00:30:51.264 --> 00:30:52.805
However death defeated us.

00:30:53.722 --> 00:30:59.847
A warrior that sheds his
enemy's blood can also shed tears.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.722
No one will ever believe it.

00:31:05.514 --> 00:31:07.430
I win every battle, Savitri.

00:31:09.472 --> 00:31:11.139
But I always..

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.722
..lose this one.

00:31:15.305 --> 00:31:17.055
I won't let you lose.

00:31:18.722 --> 00:31:21.555
We will have a grand
wedding for Raiba.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.055
The marriage procession will be so
grand, that people will watch in awe.

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:34.222
And wherever father is,
he will be happy.

00:31:34.597 --> 00:31:35.722
What is this?

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.472
When Goddess Parvati sits
on her husband, Lord Shankar's lap..

00:31:39.555 --> 00:31:40.347
..then that is right.

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:43.305
And if I sit on my husband's lap,
then that is wrong.

00:31:46.347 --> 00:31:49.722
Whole Umrath says,
'We look very good together.'

00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:52.305
That's true.

00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:58.139
But whenever we have seen ourselves,
it is simply in each other's eyes.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.222
I want to see us together.

00:32:05.055 --> 00:32:08.097
We can't even see us
together in this tiny mirror.

00:32:57.972 --> 00:32:59.639
Look.. She is here.

00:32:59.722 --> 00:33:00.805
There's more coming..

00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:02.597
The mystery has come.

00:33:03.264 --> 00:33:04.722
She has been with
him for several day..

00:33:05.097 --> 00:33:08.930
But I'm unable to understand
her relationship with our chief.

00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:10.847
Didn't I tell you..

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.347
A woman can influence even a fiend.

00:33:13.597 --> 00:33:15.472
Our chief is just a human being.

00:33:17.597 --> 00:33:19.347
The chief is looking this way.

00:33:23.764 --> 00:33:24.430
Come.

00:33:32.722 --> 00:33:34.972
How are you, my destruction?

00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:36.889
You will be destroyed.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.847
You abducted a widow from
her husband's funeral pyre.

00:33:47.055 --> 00:33:49.139
In which hell will
you pay for this sin?

00:33:59.722 --> 00:34:02.514
People turn red with anger.

00:34:04.597 --> 00:34:07.347
But you turned pink, Kamal.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.264
Just like a Lotus.

00:34:11.764 --> 00:34:13.305
Fear the god, Udaybhan.

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.972
That very god of yours has
made me fall in love with you.

00:34:22.847 --> 00:34:25.472
And now this desire
runs through my veins.

00:34:27.055 --> 00:34:28.722
This desire..

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.597
..will be buried with a shroud.

00:34:42.764 --> 00:34:44.680
If you are stubborn..

00:34:46.847 --> 00:34:48.180
..then so am I.

00:34:54.972 --> 00:34:57.264
If I don't change your no into a yes.

00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:00.847
Then even my name is not Udaybhan.

00:35:18.722 --> 00:35:20.555
- Ae Shankarya!
- Yes!

00:35:20.764 --> 00:35:23.889
Until we return after
inviting Shivaji Raje..

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:28.639
..till then your eyes
and sword should be on alert.

00:35:29.347 --> 00:35:31.847
Umrath's safety is
my responsibility now.

00:35:37.972 --> 00:35:39.389
- Ae Surya!
- Yes.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.639
The sun is upon us..

00:35:41.805 --> 00:35:43.847
..and Tanhya's talks
are not getting over.

00:35:46.033 --> 00:35:47.575
What made you laugh?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.058
Laughing without reason.

00:35:57.305 --> 00:35:59.639
People praise Shivaji Raje a lot.

00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:02.628
Honestly, today you look
even better than Shivba.

00:36:04.972 --> 00:36:07.847
There is no comparison
between Tanhya and Shivba.

00:36:09.264 --> 00:36:11.972
Shivba's thought of Swaraj
has changed the entire nation.

00:36:12.264 --> 00:36:13.722
He changed history.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.847
I'm sure that one day,
you too will change history.

00:36:18.722 --> 00:36:21.097
People write inspirational
poetries about him.

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:22.805
They will write about you too.

00:36:24.555 --> 00:36:25.389
Who will write?

00:36:25.514 --> 00:36:26.389
I will.

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:33.555
Sister-in-law..brother..hurry up.

00:36:33.805 --> 00:36:36.472
Even the horses are tired
waiting for the riders.

00:36:36.722 --> 00:36:38.273
Give me the invitation cards.

00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:41.972
Here he comes..groom is here..

00:36:42.097 --> 00:36:43.555
Start the music!

00:36:53.764 --> 00:36:58.722
Subhedar! Shivaji Raje must
come to Umrath for Raiba's wedding.

00:36:58.764 --> 00:37:03.139
And yes! If Raje is not coming
then you shouldn't come either.

00:37:03.222 --> 00:37:04.347
Understand?

00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:07.639
Aunty, whether I come or not,
but he will definitely come.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:51.555
Update me as soon as the
southern wind starts blowing.

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:52.805
Yes. Sir.

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:03.972
Accept the salutation, Raje.

00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:10.555
Udaybhan has reached
the doors of Southern region.

00:38:21.972 --> 00:38:25.180
Oh my God! What a big village!

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.555
Not a village, Raiba.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:28.555
Rajgad!

00:38:28.972 --> 00:38:30.597
The capital of Marathas.

00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:33.264
Can I ask you a question?

00:38:33.347 --> 00:38:36.472
We travelled so far
to deliver the invitation..

00:38:36.555 --> 00:38:38.972
..What If Shivaji Raje doesn't come?

00:38:39.389 --> 00:38:41.389
We'll be humiliated.

00:38:42.305 --> 00:38:44.055
Everyone in the village
will laugh on us.

00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:46.555
Raiba, You should ask Shivaji Raje..

00:38:46.764 --> 00:38:48.722
..Whether he'll attend
your wedding or not.

00:38:49.972 --> 00:38:51.597
Greetings, Subhedar!

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.430
You have been here after a long time.

00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:57.930
Yes. I am here to invite
for my son's wedding.

00:38:58.389 --> 00:38:59.305
On the day of Ashtami
(the eighth day of the lunar fortnight)

00:38:59.389 --> 00:39:00.639
No invitation for me?

00:39:01.347 --> 00:39:02.264
Of course.

00:39:02.555 --> 00:39:05.180
First invitation is for the King,
and then his people.

00:39:07.389 --> 00:39:08.222
See you.

00:39:11.264 --> 00:39:13.180
We cannot attack Kondhana.

00:39:13.305 --> 00:39:14.139
Why not, Raje?

00:39:14.222 --> 00:39:16.055
Udaybhan has reached close.

00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:20.597
If he gets the news of our attack
then he will speed up his movement.

00:39:21.722 --> 00:39:23.889
On one side,
Beshaq Khan with his army..

00:39:24.722 --> 00:39:26.472
..and on the other side, Udaybhan.

00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:31.139
It is like sticking our
feet in the crocodile's jaw.

00:39:31.847 --> 00:39:33.555
So what do we do now, Raje?

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:37.139
There is only one way.

00:39:38.264 --> 00:39:40.680
Beshaq Khan will not
come down from the fort.

00:39:41.722 --> 00:39:43.639
We will have to stop Udaybhan.

00:39:44.722 --> 00:39:48.264
Subhedar Tanhaji Malusare is here.

00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.972
He must be here to
give the invitation.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.055
Remember..

00:39:56.972 --> 00:39:59.097
Tanhya should not
know about the mission.

00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:19.764
As swaraj is growing..

00:40:20.764 --> 00:40:22.847
..you are also growing along, Tanhaji.

00:40:23.264 --> 00:40:28.555
Imagine.. what will happen
when all of India will be ours.

00:40:43.222 --> 00:40:44.180
Shelar Uncle.

00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:54.430
Suryaji..

00:40:54.514 --> 00:40:55.514
Raje..

00:41:11.722 --> 00:41:14.680
Oh my God,
You have come to the door Maa Saheb.

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:19.264
My Son came here,
along with my grandson to invite us..

00:41:19.347 --> 00:41:22.180
..then how can a mother's
happiness wait, Hmm?

00:41:22.722 --> 00:41:26.514
Shivba, you were saying that
a lion has arrived from the jungle.

00:41:27.472 --> 00:41:31.639
But I feel that your childhood
has returned from the past.

00:41:33.222 --> 00:41:36.430
Oh! Let me complete
the work I came for.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.847
Do come for the wedding
along with your entire family.

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:57.997
How are the wedding preparations
coming along, Tanhya?

00:41:58.022 --> 00:41:58.981
Very well.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.116
Actually, mother has invited
a few brahmins (priests)..

00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:04.455
..all the way from Kashi
for prayer recitation.

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.622
We were expecting them
and you arrived instead.

00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:07.747
Shivgiri maharaj?

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:08.914
Some of his disciples.

00:42:09.205 --> 00:42:10.455
They are coming here
for the first time.

00:42:15.122 --> 00:42:17.789
Great..Getting ready for battle, Raje?

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:20.642
Not at all.

00:42:25.652 --> 00:42:26.693
Remember Raje..

00:42:27.622 --> 00:42:29.997
After taking the pledge
of Swaraj at Raireshwar..

00:42:30.914 --> 00:42:33.205
..when we decided to win the fort,

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.122
Then you said..

00:42:35.872 --> 00:42:40.789
..one who pierces the branch of the tree
with his spear, shall lead the mission.

00:42:48.593 --> 00:42:52.218
Till date, I am the first to take
charge of every battle for Swaraj.

00:42:55.566 --> 00:42:56.941
Bravo!

00:42:57.789 --> 00:43:00.164
Bravo, Subhedar Tanhaji.

00:43:00.642 --> 00:43:01.892
Excellent!

00:43:02.803 --> 00:43:04.511
Accept the salutation, Raje.

00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:10.460
Breaking a branch of a tree
and breaking your enemy's skull..

00:43:10.553 --> 00:43:12.553
..are two very different things.

00:43:12.607 --> 00:43:14.107
Yes! Correct!

00:43:14.347 --> 00:43:17.972
Just like being courageous and claiming
to be courageous are two separate things.

00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:20.536
I do not just claim to be courageous.

00:43:20.872 --> 00:43:23.372
When the time comes,
I always show courage.

00:43:23.544 --> 00:43:24.919
Then let's have a duel.

00:43:25.438 --> 00:43:27.230
With Raje's permission.

00:44:17.914 --> 00:44:19.914
Lacking in practice, Pisal.

00:44:29.915 --> 00:44:32.832
You did not tell me Raje,
where is the mission?

00:44:43.289 --> 00:44:45.789
Eh Chultya,
Will you stop honing that thing?

00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:54.164
I am telling you..

00:44:55.705 --> 00:44:57.872
..go and reveal everything to Tanhaji.

00:44:59.455 --> 00:45:02.580
Tell him that Raje is
hiding something from you.

00:45:04.414 --> 00:45:08.622
If the trust is broken, only then will the
rift be created between Raje and Tanhaji.

00:45:11.747 --> 00:45:13.747
And what if it helps
in making their bond stronger?

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:17.595
Then Tanhaji will surely
proceed to win Kondhana..

00:45:18.664 --> 00:45:20.789
..but he'll never return.

00:45:23.789 --> 00:45:28.705
And What if Raje came
to know that we told Tanhaji?

00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:32.247
Then you can tell Raje..

00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:36.398
..that no one else can
win Kondhana except Tanhaji.

00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.740
And you will be out
of risk for this battle.

00:45:40.556 --> 00:45:44.764
Raje, I am concerned
about you and Swaraj.

00:45:45.997 --> 00:45:48.289
He will appreciate you.

00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:55.164
It seems your mother must have fed the
fox when she was pregnant with you.

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:03.372
Bravo, Chultya, Bravo.

00:46:08.747 --> 00:46:11.289
Hello, Subhedarji.

00:46:12.164 --> 00:46:14.580
It is your shop, master.
Choose any one.

00:46:17.622 --> 00:46:19.497
I need something big enough..

00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:22.617
..to see two faces together.

00:46:23.762 --> 00:46:26.012
Then you should take this, Subhedarji.

00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:32.935
Pisal, what brings you here?

00:46:33.622 --> 00:46:35.664
I've been looking for you, Subhedar.

00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:36.914
Oh God..

00:46:37.289 --> 00:46:39.705
What does it mean by
you were looking for me?

00:46:40.887 --> 00:46:42.721
It is a personal matter.

00:46:45.872 --> 00:46:47.122
Tie it and give.

00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:03.678
Forgive me guru.

00:47:06.164 --> 00:47:08.039
I could not welcome you.

00:47:08.064 --> 00:47:09.981
Your mother informed.

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.521
Preparing for a mission.

00:47:15.372 --> 00:47:16.997
Yes. That's the predicament.

00:47:17.205 --> 00:47:18.455
What predicament?

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.914
Now you make Aau saheb understand..

00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:23.789
She's not allowing
me to lead the mission.

00:47:28.872 --> 00:47:29.955
What is this guru?

00:47:30.039 --> 00:47:34.414
I attacked you,
and you defended with your right hand.

00:47:35.497 --> 00:47:36.789
Instead of facing it head-on.

00:47:37.497 --> 00:47:41.997
Whenever there's a crisis, it's
not always wise to face it head-on.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.580
Put your right hand forward.

00:47:45.789 --> 00:47:49.039
Right now, I can't express
this to my right hand guru.

00:47:49.455 --> 00:47:50.247
Why not?

00:47:50.539 --> 00:47:53.039
Because his son is
going to get married.

00:47:53.289 --> 00:47:56.080
Is his son's wedding
more important than Swaraj?

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.497
Is the wedding more important than the
Saffron (Maratha flag) of Marathas?

00:48:01.622 --> 00:48:06.039
Is the wedding so important that it
compels a king to lie to his soldier..

00:48:06.122 --> 00:48:08.789
..and a friend to another friend?

00:48:09.622 --> 00:48:12.080
Is the wedding far more important..

00:48:12.164 --> 00:48:15.747
..than the oath taken in Raireshwar
..with Shankar as our witness..

00:48:15.789 --> 00:48:20.497
..about living and dying together,
sharing happiness and pain together..

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:22.914
..the Maratha flag will
soar high as long as we live.

00:48:23.539 --> 00:48:25.997
If we die we go wrapped
in the saffron flag..

00:48:26.511 --> 00:48:28.386
..had to be broken.

00:48:30.247 --> 00:48:31.455
Tanhya!

00:48:40.664 --> 00:48:44.539
Swaraj is far more important
than any comfort or happiness.

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:47.455
Accept my salutations, your highness.

00:48:51.414 --> 00:48:55.539
Your tears are very precious
for your best friend.

00:48:56.747 --> 00:48:57.789
Remember.

00:48:58.455 --> 00:49:02.789
Whenever you shed tears,
Tanhaji's blood will be shedding.

00:49:04.289 --> 00:49:07.872
Now Tanhaji will lead
the mission of Kondhana.

00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:12.322
No, Tanhya.

00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:20.580
Please make your son understand,
Aau Saheb.

00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:22.205
How can I explain?

00:49:23.274 --> 00:49:25.274
You are my son as well.

00:49:30.622 --> 00:49:33.539
Your one son has
created Swaraj for you.

00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:36.789
Give the other one an opportunity
to cover your bare feet.

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:46.981
May god bless you!

00:49:47.372 --> 00:49:48.830
Jagdamb..(Mother Goddess)

00:49:58.661 --> 00:50:00.286
Now wave the Saffron flag..

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:02.273
..and let it be declared.

00:50:02.963 --> 00:50:05.047
First, the conquest over Kondhana..

00:50:05.705 --> 00:50:07.122
..and then my Raiba's wedding.

00:50:24.164 --> 00:50:25.914
We have only two options.

00:50:27.247 --> 00:50:28.039
Attack..

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.372
..or wait for him to get here.

00:50:32.747 --> 00:50:34.122
Raje, you always say..

00:50:35.747 --> 00:50:37.705
Waiting is the sign of weakness.

00:50:39.122 --> 00:50:39.955
Attack..

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.497
The First strike is
worth a million attacks.

00:50:46.955 --> 00:50:50.205
We have four routes to
reach Pune from Burhanpur, Lord.

00:50:51.414 --> 00:50:53.789
The first is Chargaon, Raje.

00:50:54.622 --> 00:50:55.914
Open fields..

00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:58.580
Udaybhan won't take the risk.

00:50:59.205 --> 00:51:01.080
The second one is Akola route,

00:51:01.414 --> 00:51:03.455
Passing through Aurangabad,
en route to Pune.

00:51:07.997 --> 00:51:09.122
Rural area.

00:51:11.039 --> 00:51:12.914
He will not pass
through the settlement.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.497
The third route is
through Khandesh to Pune.

00:51:17.872 --> 00:51:19.247
The longest route.

00:51:21.872 --> 00:51:22.789
Not possible.

00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:24.747
And the fourth route, Lord.

00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:25.664
This one..

00:51:26.455 --> 00:51:27.997
..because it is the shortest route..

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:30.705
..Which passes through the hills..

00:51:33.247 --> 00:51:34.789
..and easier to camouflage.

00:51:36.872 --> 00:51:38.914
So what route shall we take, Lord?

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.580
We will travel through Shirdhon.

00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:49.789
Shirdhon!

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.705
Shirdhon, Raje, Shirdhon.

00:51:52.372 --> 00:51:54.205
Udaybhan will take the Shirdhon route.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.789
If I don't turn Shirdhon
into Udaybhan's grave..

00:52:01.622 --> 00:52:03.414
..then I am not a real Maratha.

00:52:17.247 --> 00:52:20.914
Chultya! I am giving
you an important task.

00:52:21.198 --> 00:52:22.122
Yes. Master.

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:25.122
It is a delicate task
and your life could be at risk.

00:52:26.122 --> 00:52:30.580
You must reach to Udaybhan
before Tanhaji reaches Shirdhon.

00:52:31.497 --> 00:52:32.122
Me?

00:52:32.205 --> 00:52:34.580
Tell him that I am his ally.

00:52:36.247 --> 00:52:38.872
Once I acquire Shivaji's position..

00:52:39.455 --> 00:52:41.289
..then I shall be of his service.

00:52:42.705 --> 00:52:43.789
Yes. Master.

00:52:45.558 --> 00:52:47.600
Glory to..Mahadev!

00:52:48.622 --> 00:52:50.080
Glory to..Mahadev!

00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:53.869
Hey Salim..

00:52:56.546 --> 00:52:57.254
Buddy..

00:52:59.247 --> 00:53:01.789
Hey, friend, What happened?

00:53:02.164 --> 00:53:04.080
We've been camping
here since three days.

00:53:05.247 --> 00:53:06.747
And we are not moving forward,

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:11.122
And the chief won't take
his eyes off of that lady.

00:53:11.205 --> 00:53:13.122
Don't start complaining again.

00:53:13.205 --> 00:53:14.789
Who is this lady?

00:53:15.955 --> 00:53:18.289
You don't understand one thing.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:20.622
Somebody has rightly said..

00:53:20.705 --> 00:53:23.372
"First love is very fatal."

00:53:25.622 --> 00:53:27.830
Yes. That's true.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.747
Even fire seems like a toy.

00:53:48.378 --> 00:53:49.253
My Lord!

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960
My Lord!

00:54:02.429 --> 00:54:04.554
Some Maratha has come to see you.

00:54:21.507 --> 00:54:22.632
Udaybhanji..

00:54:23.249 --> 00:54:24.249
Who are you?

00:54:24.339 --> 00:54:26.506
Mmm.. I am Chultya.

00:54:27.997 --> 00:54:28.747
Chu what?

00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:30.747
Yes..Yes..Yes..Chultya, Chultya.

00:54:36.146 --> 00:54:37.396
This is for you.

00:54:37.715 --> 00:54:38.923
Jagat Singh.

00:54:45.164 --> 00:54:48.122
Salutation from Chandraji Pisal.

00:54:50.122 --> 00:54:51.705
I have news for you.

00:54:52.705 --> 00:54:56.455
Maratha chieftain Tanhaji Malusare
is hiding in the mountains of Shirdon.

00:54:59.122 --> 00:55:00.747
Beware of the attack.

00:55:01.997 --> 00:55:05.414
A friend..Chandraji Pisal.

00:55:10.497 --> 00:55:12.497
What is the purpose of
sharing this news with me?

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.730
Friendship, my Lord. Friendship.

00:55:15.814 --> 00:55:19.064
Chandraji Pisal wants to
be in the good books of Alamgir.

00:55:19.383 --> 00:55:22.508
After all, the enemy of the
enemy is a friend, right my Lord?

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:24.789
Who is the enemy?

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:26.497
Of course, Tanhaji Malasure.

00:55:27.247 --> 00:55:28.122
And friend?

00:55:29.872 --> 00:55:33.455
My Lord.. You.. Udaybhan Rathore.

00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:47.289
Chuu ji.

00:55:48.234 --> 00:55:50.026
That is my informer.

00:55:53.237 --> 00:55:55.570
If your information matches with his..

00:55:56.691 --> 00:55:58.024
..then you are my friend.

00:56:02.085 --> 00:56:03.710
And if it doesn't..

00:56:05.389 --> 00:56:07.681
Then there will be one less Chuu..

00:56:13.205 --> 00:56:14.497
..in this world.

00:56:27.357 --> 00:56:30.524
Lord ..Some Maratha,
Tanhaji is keeping a watch..

00:56:30.626 --> 00:56:32.751
..from the mountains
of Shirdhon with his soldiers.

00:56:36.646 --> 00:56:37.980
I told you.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:47.938
Jagat Singh,
Take good care of my friend.

00:56:52.455 --> 00:56:55.955
Ae..look.. there is a void..

00:56:56.039 --> 00:57:01.039
Ae..Ae.. do it quickly.. come on..

00:57:01.914 --> 00:57:04.830
My child, handle it gently..

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.414
You will make my tomb here.

00:57:07.664 --> 00:57:09.080
This is gunpowder..Explosives.

00:57:09.164 --> 00:57:11.122
Yes Uncle.

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:16.293
He will not pass through our territory
during the day with his massive army.

00:57:17.585 --> 00:57:19.168
He will travel at night.

00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:44.941
Where is this river going,
Khaibar Khan?

00:57:45.313 --> 00:57:47.730
Sir, People says that
it is going towards south.

00:57:50.039 --> 00:57:51.622
Can you see that coconut tree?

00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:55.747
Yes.

00:57:56.994 --> 00:57:58.077
Cut it down.

00:58:02.414 --> 00:58:03.414
Yes Sir.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.955
The army is getting
restless to march ahead.

00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:09.789
From today onwards, we will travel
only in the night, Khaiber Khan.

00:58:10.345 --> 00:58:11.095
Bur Sir..

00:58:12.664 --> 00:58:14.414
Which route shall we take now?

00:58:16.539 --> 00:58:17.705
Via Shirdhon.

00:58:41.955 --> 00:58:42.955
Look.

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.622
Subhedar! (Commander!)

00:58:56.647 --> 00:58:57.481
The cannon is approaching..

00:58:57.506 --> 00:58:59.089
..but the army seems
to be very low in number.

01:00:27.914 --> 01:00:31.414
Subhedarji (Commander),
you have been betrayed.

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:32.955
We are all Marathas.

01:00:34.955 --> 01:00:35.789
Stop it...

01:01:39.539 --> 01:01:40.955
Bravo Udaybhanji.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.164
Amazing..

01:01:44.622 --> 01:01:47.747
One must learn how to
deceive the enemy from you!

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:53.539
Wonder where that Tanhaji
will be hiding his face.

01:02:42.754 --> 01:02:44.921
Everyone stumbles with a stone.

01:02:45.648 --> 01:02:47.648
But the one who rises
is a true Maratha.

01:02:51.372 --> 01:02:52.539
Pick up your sword.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.872
Say Goddess Bhawani , Jai Shivaji.

01:02:54.897 --> 01:02:56.147
Conquer.

01:02:56.955 --> 01:02:59.039
Strike it ,Tanhya strike it.

01:02:59.789 --> 01:03:00.997
Kondhana will be at your feet..

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.872
..and you will be the
commander of Kondhana.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.078
Brother, now we should go to Rajgad.

01:03:09.515 --> 01:03:10.473
No Surya.

01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:12.914
Send the army back.

01:03:13.284 --> 01:03:15.492
You and uncle reach
at Umrath along with Raiba.

01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:18.294
And gather our soldiers.

01:03:19.884 --> 01:03:21.384
And where are you going?

01:03:22.205 --> 01:03:23.914
To endure the situation.

01:03:27.705 --> 01:03:29.747
What shall I tell Shivba if he asks?

01:03:31.164 --> 01:03:33.789
Tell him, Tanhya will show his face..

01:03:34.372 --> 01:03:36.747
..only after Udaybhan's death..

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:39.080
..and our saffron flag
is waving over Kondhana.

01:04:30.611 --> 01:04:36.070
This is Udaybhan's first victory
against Marathas in the Deccan.

01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:37.287
Congratulations my lord!

01:04:37.579 --> 01:04:38.704
Congratulations.

01:04:44.557 --> 01:04:48.724
Beshaq Khan,
Send a message to Alamgir.

01:04:49.856 --> 01:04:52.273
The Nagin has reached Kondhana

01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:55.898
Now ready to sting Swaraj.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.689
Turn the Cannon..

01:05:04.648 --> 01:05:06.606
..and aim at Rajgad.

01:05:18.273 --> 01:05:21.689
But sire,
at least wait for Alamgir's orders.

01:05:24.689 --> 01:05:27.023
Think about it, sire.

01:05:57.689 --> 01:06:00.856
Now Shivaji is under my control.

01:06:01.814 --> 01:06:04.231
There is news from Deccan.

01:06:06.564 --> 01:06:09.189
Udaybhan and Nagin
have reached Kondhana.

01:06:10.648 --> 01:06:14.356
Now, no one can stop your
dream of conquering all of India.

01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:23.064
Kondhana is unbeatable.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.939
Invulnerable..

01:06:28.064 --> 01:06:32.481
Filled with rocky paths
and steep deathly slopes.

01:06:32.773 --> 01:06:35.023
The bushes are so deep..

01:06:35.273 --> 01:06:38.189
..that even the wind screams
while blowing through it.

01:06:38.273 --> 01:06:42.106
The structure is so high,
that it mocks the cannonballs.

01:06:45.856 --> 01:06:51.231
You cannot conquer Kondhana
just by staring at it.

01:06:51.398 --> 01:06:54.106
That is why I came
looking for you, Baba.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:01.564
You've guarded the
fort for many years.

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.689
No matter how strong the fort is..

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:09.356
..there is always a secret passage.

01:07:10.523 --> 01:07:14.481
There is a secret passage, which
comes down to the bottom of the fort.

01:07:15.356 --> 01:07:19.148
But it must be covered
by the branches now.

01:07:20.898 --> 01:07:27.064
No one knows where it leads to,
at the foothills.

01:07:27.148 --> 01:07:30.898
It has been years, but no
one has passed through that passage.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.356
Listen.

01:07:34.939 --> 01:07:38.523
There's a banyan tree
in the prison's courtyard.

01:07:38.606 --> 01:07:42.439
And there's a secret door behind it.

01:07:45.523 --> 01:07:48.606
..But you won't be
able to reach there.

01:07:52.023 --> 01:07:53.648
I will reach Baba.

01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:56.648
Why are you risking your life?

01:07:59.064 --> 01:08:01.773
Baba, when Saffron (Maratha
flag) runs through my veins..

01:08:03.398 --> 01:08:05.523
..then who cares about life!!!

01:08:06.106 --> 01:08:07.814
You are right..

01:08:09.856 --> 01:08:11.439
I am blind..

01:08:12.814 --> 01:08:15.481
..but even I want to see freedom.

01:08:17.523 --> 01:08:19.773
Have some bread.

01:08:24.523 --> 01:08:28.231
What are you thinking?
There is a man who can help you.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.398
Who?

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:33.856
The Maratha fort
keeper of the Mughals..

01:08:34.273 --> 01:08:36.064
Gheresarnaik!!

01:08:41.356 --> 01:08:44.106
Gheresarnaik! Is he your man?

01:08:44.398 --> 01:08:45.481
Yes, sire.

01:08:46.314 --> 01:08:48.189
He made a mistake last night, sire.

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:49.856
Forgive him.

01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:53.064
What happened?

01:08:53.398 --> 01:08:55.398
Sire, he forgot to reply last night.

01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:59.606
As always,
we yelled from above, Stay awake..

01:09:01.064 --> 01:09:03.731
And he had to reply "Stay alert".

01:09:04.898 --> 01:09:06.189
But he didn't reply.

01:09:06.564 --> 01:09:09.856
My lord, last night I was
facing a wild boar at that moment.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.064
If I had made a sound,
it would've attacked.

01:09:25.231 --> 01:09:27.648
Last night you faced
a wild boar, is it?

01:09:28.106 --> 01:09:29.231
Yes, my lord.

01:09:29.606 --> 01:09:31.606
So now, you are facing a lion.

01:09:32.648 --> 01:09:33.523
Say it...

01:09:34.064 --> 01:09:35.026
Will you speak?

01:09:35.106 --> 01:09:36.314
No..

01:09:36.398 --> 01:09:38.439
Stay alert!

01:09:38.523 --> 01:09:41.109
Sire..Sire.. please forgive him.

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.648
He'll never repeat this mistake again.

01:09:42.731 --> 01:09:46.109
Stay awake... Say alert... Stay awake!

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:47.689
He'll never repeat this mistake again.

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:50.106
Stay awake!

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:51.314
Kashi!

01:10:00.356 --> 01:10:01.981
He still didn't say stay alert.

01:10:08.981 --> 01:10:11.439
There is no mercy for any
mistake in Udaybhan's court.

01:10:12.064 --> 01:10:13.731
Only punishments.

01:10:16.981 --> 01:10:19.398
Even dogs are better
than you Gheresarnaik.

01:10:23.273 --> 01:10:25.564
At least they stay
loyal to their master.

01:10:32.106 --> 01:10:33.273
Satya...

01:10:34.273 --> 01:10:38.939
Under any circumstances,
no one can know what happened here.

01:10:39.689 --> 01:10:40.939
Yes Naik.

01:10:43.689 --> 01:10:45.523
Naik, we searched the entire forest.

01:10:46.023 --> 01:10:47.898
But, could not trace Kashi.

01:10:48.606 --> 01:10:50.814
I guess the wild animals..

01:11:06.481 --> 01:11:07.648
Who's there?

01:11:14.273 --> 01:11:17.939
First, try to recognize him.

01:11:18.356 --> 01:11:20.356
Kashi is no more.

01:11:23.273 --> 01:11:24.439
Oh God!

01:11:26.023 --> 01:11:29.273
How could he be so stupid
to go near the broken wall?

01:11:31.814 --> 01:11:33.273
He slipped.

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:36.064
The burden of lie is too heavy.

01:11:37.564 --> 01:11:39.068
Why don't you tell us the truth?

01:11:39.148 --> 01:11:40.314
What truth?

01:11:41.314 --> 01:11:46.856
Last night, while guarding the fort,
Kashi forgot to say 'stay alert' once.

01:11:47.356 --> 01:11:48.689
Who told you that?

01:11:48.773 --> 01:11:53.731
A dying man can never lie.

01:11:57.773 --> 01:12:00.564
Naik, is it true?

01:12:02.814 --> 01:12:03.939
It's true.

01:12:04.398 --> 01:12:09.314
But what option do we have other than
staying quiet in front of Udaybhan?

01:12:09.564 --> 01:12:11.314
The same thing that
you've been doing till now...

01:12:13.023 --> 01:12:14.148
Betrayal!

01:12:15.856 --> 01:12:18.064
Stop betraying your own motherland.

01:12:19.398 --> 01:12:20.648
Now betray your enemy.

01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:21.856
Why should we?

01:12:22.648 --> 01:12:23.439
For whom?

01:12:23.564 --> 01:12:24.898
For Swaraj (Self-rule).

01:12:25.148 --> 01:12:26.648
For future generations.

01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:28.189
For Shivaji Raje.

01:12:30.106 --> 01:12:34.564
Who handed over 23 forts in a treaty..

01:12:34.648 --> 01:12:38.106
..without thinking
what would happen to us.

01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:39.564
Shivba had no choice.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.648
This mission is to
reconquer those forts again.

01:12:42.856 --> 01:12:45.689
And the first one is this fort..
Kondhana.

01:12:45.773 --> 01:12:48.648
Are you crazy?
You want to conquer Kondhana?

01:12:49.148 --> 01:12:51.939
He has come here
with our death warrants.

01:12:52.064 --> 01:12:53.814
Where are you living anyway?

01:12:54.398 --> 01:12:56.023
You have no dignity.

01:12:56.898 --> 01:12:59.981
Even during the daylight,
your mothers and sisters are not safe.

01:13:00.523 --> 01:13:03.356
Your animals are dragged
away in your presence.

01:13:03.939 --> 01:13:06.398
Brahmins can't pray,
farmers can't cultivate..

01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:09.273
In fact, you can't even chant
Shri Ram's name during funeral rites.

01:13:09.356 --> 01:13:10.814
And you call this a life.

01:13:12.481 --> 01:13:14.189
How many more times
are you going to die?

01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:21.148
There Alamgir breaks the
temple of Kashi Vishwanath..

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.523
..and here Udaybhan kills Kashi.

01:13:26.523 --> 01:13:28.439
And we guard them.

01:13:28.856 --> 01:13:30.023
Every night.

01:13:30.814 --> 01:13:32.314
Stay Alert..

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:33.939
Stay awake..

01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:36.106
Wake up Gheresarnaik!

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.023
You're lucky, Kashi.

01:13:48.523 --> 01:13:49.898
And I was the fool..

01:13:50.773 --> 01:13:53.564
..who came here to breathe
life into a bunch of dead people.

01:13:55.314 --> 01:13:56.523
Good-bye.

01:13:57.439 --> 01:13:58.856
Beware!

01:13:59.231 --> 01:14:00.398
Who are you?

01:14:03.148 --> 01:14:04.523
From Umrath..

01:14:05.439 --> 01:14:06.231
Name..

01:14:07.314 --> 01:14:09.398
Subhedar Tanhaji Malusare.

01:14:11.398 --> 01:14:12.731
Subhedar! (Commander)

01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:20.064
Forgive us, Subhedar!

01:14:22.023 --> 01:14:25.064
From now on,
we will do whatever you say.

01:14:25.444 --> 01:14:29.485
I want to see enemy
before defeating him.

01:14:29.814 --> 01:14:31.314
Consider it done.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:36.385
Day after tomorrow, there is a religious
fair of Kondaneshwar Mahadev on the fort..

01:14:57.398 --> 01:14:58.481
"Shankara."

01:15:06.106 --> 01:15:07.231
"Shankara."

01:15:24.773 --> 01:15:26.898
"Grab me if you identify."

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.398
"Grab me if you identify."

01:15:33.439 --> 01:15:37.773
"Light the fire of blood
in my crafty-clever mind."

01:15:37.856 --> 01:15:42.106
"Light the fire of blood
in my crafty-clever mind."

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:01.773
"My moustache has a spark."

01:16:01.856 --> 01:16:03.981
"My stance is carefree."

01:16:04.064 --> 01:16:06.106
"My dance is like a sword."

01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:08.314
"And ember in my words."

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:12.689
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:16:12.773 --> 01:16:17.106
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:21.398
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:16:21.481 --> 01:16:25.773
"I am a lion dressed in fox's skin."

01:16:25.856 --> 01:16:30.148
"Who play gimmicks
for the benefit of people."

01:16:32.398 --> 01:16:34.523
"Grab me if you identify."

01:16:34.606 --> 01:16:36.689
"Grab me if you identify."

01:16:38.939 --> 01:16:43.189
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:16:43.273 --> 01:16:47.898
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:54.398
"First conquest of Kondhana..

01:16:56.148 --> 01:16:59.523
"Mavala of your Kondhana.."

01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:03.981
"First conquest of Kondhana..

01:17:04.856 --> 01:17:08.106
"Mavala of your Kondhana.."

01:17:09.773 --> 01:17:11.606
"Open the gates of your heart."

01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:13.814
"Your master has arrived."

01:17:14.106 --> 01:17:15.939
"I bring war as I walk."

01:17:16.023 --> 01:17:18.439
"With a lot of trickeries."

01:17:18.523 --> 01:17:20.273
"Fences are elevated."

01:17:20.356 --> 01:17:22.481
"I came here to jump over them."

01:17:22.564 --> 01:17:24.731
"Grab me if you identify."

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:27.189
"Grab me if you identify."

01:17:35.648 --> 01:17:40.023
"Light the fire of blood
in my crafty-clever mind."

01:17:40.106 --> 01:17:44.231
"Light the fire of blood
in my crafty-clever mind."

01:17:44.439 --> 01:17:48.731
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:17:48.814 --> 01:17:53.068
"Brave warrior. Brave warrior... "

01:17:53.148 --> 01:17:57.356
"The flame that glows is
of my Bhawani (Mother Goddess)."

01:17:57.439 --> 01:18:01.481
"The flame that glows is
of my Bhawani (Mother Goddess)."

01:18:01.564 --> 01:18:06.109
"The flame that glows is
of my Bhawani (Mother Goddess)."

01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:12.648
"The flame that glows is
of my Bhawani (Mother Goddess)."

01:18:22.481 --> 01:18:23.606
Why did you kill him?

01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:27.023
In any corner of the world,
the traitor has only one punishment.

01:18:30.148 --> 01:18:31.231
Who are you?

01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:37.023
Tanhaji.

01:18:45.273 --> 01:18:46.356
Khaiber Khan!

01:18:46.439 --> 01:18:47.273
Yes sire.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.856
Will you bear the
trouble of arresting him?

01:19:15.439 --> 01:19:19.068
There's a banyan tree
in the prison's courtyard.

01:19:19.148 --> 01:19:22.189
And there's a secret
passage behind it.

01:19:26.814 --> 01:19:28.939
You must be regretting now.

01:19:33.106 --> 01:19:35.773
If you had known
about me before coming..

01:19:35.856 --> 01:19:37.773
..then you would've
never dared to come here.

01:19:39.773 --> 01:19:40.898
You would be scared.

01:19:41.356 --> 01:19:46.564
If someone stands in front of you
and says that he's not afraid of you..

01:19:47.314 --> 01:19:50.106
Then understand, he is either mad..

01:19:51.523 --> 01:19:53.148
..or a Maratha.

01:19:57.106 --> 01:19:58.856
Are you mad?

01:19:59.814 --> 01:20:01.398
Every Maratha is mad..

01:20:02.148 --> 01:20:03.398
For Swaraj (Self-rule)..

01:20:03.648 --> 01:20:04.814
For Shivaji Raje..

01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:06.398
For Saffron (Maratha flag)..

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:12.856
I will eliminate the existence
of the saffron (Maratha flag)..

01:20:14.939 --> 01:20:16.773
..from the face of this earth.

01:20:17.231 --> 01:20:19.356
Who are you to eliminate the Saffron..

01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:22.439
..that befalls upon us from the skies.

01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:24.564
Twice a day.

01:20:25.148 --> 01:20:27.106
Before the sun rises..

01:20:28.273 --> 01:20:30.314
..and after the sun sets.

01:20:33.356 --> 01:20:35.648
You're emotionally
connected to your soil..

01:20:37.064 --> 01:20:38.856
..whereas my wisdom has no emotions.

01:20:40.814 --> 01:20:42.439
You can sacrifice your life..

01:20:43.773 --> 01:20:45.939
.. and I can take lives.

01:20:46.773 --> 01:20:48.064
Right now.

01:20:50.648 --> 01:20:52.689
I can bury you into this soil.

01:20:52.773 --> 01:20:56.648
I'll be fortunate to sacrifice
my life for my motherland.

01:20:58.814 --> 01:21:00.689
You should think about yourself.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.314
If this soil refuses to accept you..

01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:06.189
..then what will happen
to your corpse? (dead body)

01:21:20.398 --> 01:21:21.356
Wait Udaybhan!

01:21:23.314 --> 01:21:26.648
He's the bait for the
rat that you want to finish.

01:21:27.398 --> 01:21:30.731
If Tanhaji is here,
then Shivaji will surely come here.

01:21:31.231 --> 01:21:33.773
My sword's out of its scabbard,
Jagat Singh.

01:21:34.648 --> 01:21:36.731
It won't return without tasting blood.

01:21:37.773 --> 01:21:42.689
What you will do tomorrow, do it now.

01:21:49.314 --> 01:21:51.731
If you remain engrossed in thinking..

01:21:52.439 --> 01:21:54.523
..when will you kill the enemy?

01:22:06.356 --> 01:22:07.856
You were right.

01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:10.898
Every traitor has only one punishment.

01:22:11.981 --> 01:22:12.939
Death.

01:22:15.148 --> 01:22:17.148
Now both of us will wait..

01:22:20.106 --> 01:22:21.148
You, for death.

01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:28.523
Me, for Shivaji.

01:23:05.299 --> 01:23:05.924
Eat it.

01:23:06.299 --> 01:23:08.132
It will give you strength
to bear the pain.

01:23:36.174 --> 01:23:38.382
I need your help.

01:23:40.174 --> 01:23:41.840
For the sake of my sister.

01:23:42.965 --> 01:23:44.132
For the sake of Kamal.

01:23:47.924 --> 01:23:50.215
We lived in a small
village in the desert.

01:23:50.965 --> 01:23:52.632
Called Retipur.

01:23:54.882 --> 01:23:57.007
Udaybhan was the son of our minister.

01:23:58.507 --> 01:24:01.715
All the children from the
royal family used to play together.

01:24:02.882 --> 01:24:06.840
One day, the prince of Tidwana
sent a marriage proposal to Kamal.

01:24:07.465 --> 01:24:08.924
Udaybhan grew restless.

01:24:09.132 --> 01:24:10.674
I love you a lot.

01:24:13.049 --> 01:24:14.590
Are you joking?

01:24:15.549 --> 01:24:17.549
My love is not a joke.

01:24:22.132 --> 01:24:23.799
We cannot be together.

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:26.590
But why?

01:24:30.049 --> 01:24:32.674
Marriage is the union
of two equal people, Udaybhan.

01:24:33.132 --> 01:24:34.715
So what's lacking in me?

01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:40.549
I don't deserve you just
because you're a princess..

01:24:40.632 --> 01:24:41.840
..and I am just a...

01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:44.590
I wish that were the only case.

01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:46.049
Then?

01:24:46.924 --> 01:24:48.340
It's about lineage.

01:24:50.132 --> 01:24:52.090
You might be the son of a minister.

01:24:52.632 --> 01:24:54.965
..but your mother...

01:25:06.195 --> 01:25:08.404
After that he left Rajputana,

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:11.459
No one knew where he went.

01:25:11.753 --> 01:25:14.503
Kamal got married to
the prince of Dhuliket.

01:25:15.337 --> 01:25:17.962
One day, Udaybhan was
seen with the Mughals.

01:25:18.753 --> 01:25:20.337
They attacked Dhuliket.

01:25:21.212 --> 01:25:23.795
The Mughals assassinated
Kamal's husband.

01:25:24.378 --> 01:25:27.670
And Udaybhan abducted
my widowed sister.

01:25:28.837 --> 01:25:31.462
And you joined him
to protect your sister.

01:25:36.003 --> 01:25:38.045
Tanhaji Malusare gives you his word..

01:25:39.295 --> 01:25:41.295
Our goals may be different..

01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:43.337
..but we have a common enemy.

01:25:44.795 --> 01:25:48.420
From today onwards, this Rajput shall
never raise his sword on a Maratha again.

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.753
On the night of Ashtami
(the eighth day of the lunar fortnight)

01:25:54.503 --> 01:25:56.670
You will have to
keep Udaybhan occupied.

01:25:57.962 --> 01:25:59.795
- Jai Bhavani!
- Jai Bhavani!

01:26:00.859 --> 01:26:03.795
The prisoner's cuffs have come loose.
Hurry up and tighten them again.

01:26:27.628 --> 01:26:29.295
- Search him.
- Yes sire.

01:27:22.795 --> 01:27:23.837
Where did he go?

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.837
We searched every nook
and corner of the fort..

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.087
..but, we couldn't find him.

01:27:35.337 --> 01:27:37.087
It hurts, doesn't it?

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:42.503
It does, when one gets slapped.

01:27:43.712 --> 01:27:45.337
Look at this, Look!

01:27:46.587 --> 01:27:48.212
The mark of Tanhaji's claw.

01:27:53.003 --> 01:27:54.212
It hurts.

01:27:58.753 --> 01:28:01.170
Send our soldiers in every direction.

01:28:02.253 --> 01:28:04.337
Any village that helps him..

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.378
Burn it.

01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:09.045
I..

01:28:09.337 --> 01:28:10.337
want..

01:28:11.462 --> 01:28:12.753
Tanhaji.

01:28:29.253 --> 01:28:30.795
We apologise, Malpatil ji.

01:28:31.462 --> 01:28:33.128
Everything happened suddenly.

01:28:33.378 --> 01:28:35.503
Tanhaji gave his word to Shivaji Raje.

01:28:35.878 --> 01:28:38.295
And the promise given
to me has no worth?

01:28:39.462 --> 01:28:41.462
To change the auspicious
day of marriage means..

01:28:42.378 --> 01:28:45.003
What reputation will I have
in the village Subhedarni bai?

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.920
We're a family now, Malpatil.

01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:50.837
Your reputation is our reputation.

01:28:51.587 --> 01:28:53.503
And as you can see,
the preparations for Raiba's wedding..

01:28:53.587 --> 01:28:55.212
..is in full swing in our village too.

01:28:56.462 --> 01:28:58.462
But we wish the
wedding to take place..

01:28:58.545 --> 01:29:00.587
..on the date that was decided.

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:02.212
What difference does it make?

01:29:02.295 --> 01:29:03.337
After a couple of days..

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:06.420
We want this wedding to take place on Ashtami
(the eighth day of the lunar fortnight) only!

01:29:07.753 --> 01:29:09.420
That is not possible Sahukar ji.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.837
Brother took an oath
in front of Shivaji Raje.

01:29:13.462 --> 01:29:15.170
First, victory over Kondhana..

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.170
..and then Raiba's wedding.

01:29:17.962 --> 01:29:19.003
Shivaji Raje!

01:29:19.545 --> 01:29:22.003
I would've honoured his oath if it was
taken in the witness of God.

01:29:22.337 --> 01:29:24.045
Shivaji Raje is just a human being.

01:29:24.128 --> 01:29:25.878
But he's no less than God.

01:29:26.712 --> 01:29:30.545
Don't forget Sahukar,
He's the pride of us Marathas.

01:29:31.462 --> 01:29:33.462
When Shivaji Raje wields his sword..

01:29:33.837 --> 01:29:38.087
..it safeguards and supports the honour
of women and homes of everyone.

01:29:39.462 --> 01:29:41.920
He make all of us proud.

01:29:42.003 --> 01:29:46.712
But nobody knows when that pride will
be besmirched in the name of Swaraj.

01:29:48.087 --> 01:29:51.170
It's better to die like warrior,
than to live like a coward.

01:29:51.253 --> 01:29:53.003
If the mission is unsuccessful..

01:29:54.712 --> 01:29:57.503
..God forbid..
if something happens to the Subhedar?

01:30:05.212 --> 01:30:06.337
I promise you..

01:30:07.878 --> 01:30:09.753
Whatever the outcome of the mission..

01:30:10.545 --> 01:30:14.628
..the very next day, your daughter
will become our daughter-in-law.

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.670
Well said my daughter-in-law!

01:30:17.295 --> 01:30:18.795
You may leave now.

01:30:19.295 --> 01:30:23.128
He's coming.
Subhedar's coming.

01:30:23.878 --> 01:30:26.378
Subhedar's coming.

01:30:38.587 --> 01:30:41.420
So Surya, are the preparations done?

01:30:41.503 --> 01:30:42.337
Yes. Brother.

01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:44.378
Your wish is my command.

01:30:44.837 --> 01:30:46.420
What's the news about the enemy?

01:30:50.628 --> 01:30:54.503
One fort..two doors..five hundred
fighters..two thousand Mughals.

01:30:55.337 --> 01:30:58.462
One Nagin (serpent)..one
snake charmer,Udaybhan.

01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:17.003
You're applying turmeric..

01:31:19.712 --> 01:31:22.295
..but your tears are
adding salt to my wounds.

01:31:27.545 --> 01:31:29.295
I convinced Malpatil..

01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:32.712
..but how do I convince myself?

01:31:40.837 --> 01:31:42.128
Tell me one thing..

01:31:43.212 --> 01:31:45.253
..on one side is the
debt I owe to my motherland..

01:31:45.753 --> 01:31:47.837
..and on the other
is my duty towards family.

01:31:48.628 --> 01:31:50.128
What's more important?

01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:54.878
I can ask questions too.

01:31:56.378 --> 01:31:58.420
On one side is a mother's love..

01:31:59.212 --> 01:32:01.003
..and on the other
is her husband's oath.

01:32:02.253 --> 01:32:04.045
Now what's more important?

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:07.712
In response, I can only say..

01:32:08.712 --> 01:32:10.628
On one side are a human's desires..

01:32:11.628 --> 01:32:13.628
..and the other side
are their deeds (duty).

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:16.003
What's more important?

01:32:18.837 --> 01:32:22.087
You have a way with words,
just like you do with a sword.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.337
It's impossible to win against you.

01:32:27.045 --> 01:32:29.337
Imagine if I win Kondhana..

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.628
..then what gift will you give me?

01:32:33.753 --> 01:32:35.003
Why imagine?

01:32:36.378 --> 01:32:37.628
I know you will win.

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.170
And the gift will
be whatever you want.

01:32:45.128 --> 01:32:46.087
Then promise me.

01:32:47.545 --> 01:32:49.920
You will welcome
me dressed as a bride.

01:33:16.003 --> 01:33:16.962
Brother?

01:33:17.753 --> 01:33:18.795
Don't be afraid, Kamal.

01:33:19.837 --> 01:33:22.170
Udaybhan is inspecting
the fort's security.

01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:26.462
I want to tell you
something important.

01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:31.712
On the night of Ashtami
(the eighth day of the lunar fortnight)..

01:33:31.795 --> 01:33:34.462
..Tanhaji Malusare will attack Kondhana.

01:33:35.212 --> 01:33:38.837
Along with Kondhana,
we will also be set free.

01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:43.587
Kamal, I think we should help him.

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:47.337
How, brother?

01:33:51.587 --> 01:33:53.878
You should accept Udaybhan's
marriage proposal.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.712
He will be lost in his happiness.

01:33:57.295 --> 01:33:59.337
And it will make
Tanhaji's work easier.

01:34:04.962 --> 01:34:06.920
You trust Tanhaji so much?

01:34:09.753 --> 01:34:12.462
I have seen history in Tanhaji's eyes.

01:34:14.503 --> 01:34:16.337
And soon he will turn it.

01:34:26.795 --> 01:34:28.337
Forgive them.

01:34:29.337 --> 01:34:31.795
Our soldiers were guarding
with their eyes wide open.

01:34:32.378 --> 01:34:37.087
Right right, maybe that's
how Tanhaji Malasure escaped.

01:34:38.503 --> 01:34:41.003
Very safely.

01:34:42.837 --> 01:34:44.753
Where did he go after
escaping the fort?

01:34:44.837 --> 01:34:46.295
No one knows.

01:34:47.503 --> 01:34:48.628
Went looking for him.

01:34:49.337 --> 01:34:50.628
You couldn't find him anywhere.

01:34:54.462 --> 01:34:57.295
Because of this,
I granted life to these slackers.

01:34:58.253 --> 01:34:59.378
Sire! Sire!

01:34:59.753 --> 01:35:02.253
Please reconsider.
Spare their lives.

01:35:08.628 --> 01:35:10.295
What kind of a joke is this, Jagat?

01:35:10.628 --> 01:35:11.753
Not a joke..

01:35:11.962 --> 01:35:13.337
A message of hope.

01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:15.003
The outcome of your desires.

01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:18.420
Dreams, wishes, aspirations..

01:35:21.003 --> 01:35:22.962
An auspicious gesture of your wedding.

01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:37.295
What does it mean?

01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:39.087
Kamal said yes.

01:35:40.087 --> 01:35:42.253
She will be yours on next Ashtami
(the eighth day of the lunar fortnight).

01:35:44.087 --> 01:35:45.587
Glory to Eklingji!

01:35:45.670 --> 01:35:46.712
Sire!

01:36:06.087 --> 01:36:08.045
What gift will you
give me on my wedding?

01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:09.503
Whatever you want.

01:36:13.087 --> 01:36:15.045
Tanhaji Malusare!

01:37:18.962 --> 01:37:21.545
- Magic..Magic.
- Giddya!

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:23.295
- Giddya!
- Magic..Magic.

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:25.587
Giddya! Have it.

01:37:28.712 --> 01:37:30.837
Now you go and do so such a trick..

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.628
..show such bravery
that the enemies squirm.

01:37:35.837 --> 01:37:36.628
Mom.

01:37:37.712 --> 01:37:38.587
What is this?

01:37:38.962 --> 01:37:40.003
For good luck.

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.503
To make the enemies squirm.

01:37:47.003 --> 01:37:50.170
Today, last wish of Giddya's
father has come true.

01:37:50.253 --> 01:37:51.920
Giddya has become a soldier.

01:37:53.837 --> 01:37:56.087
May god bless Tanhaji with success.

01:37:57.712 --> 01:38:02.977
Father, everyone is saying
that Udaybhan has a huge army.

01:38:03.087 --> 01:38:04.587
How will we defeat him?

01:38:05.378 --> 01:38:06.420
Now you tell me..

01:38:06.545 --> 01:38:08.628
How many Kauravas were there
in the battle of Mahabharata?

01:38:10.878 --> 01:38:13.003
How many were the Pandavas?
- Five!

01:38:13.795 --> 01:38:16.128
Who won the battle?
- Pandavas.

01:38:16.337 --> 01:38:17.753
Raiba, who will win today?

01:38:17.837 --> 01:38:20.170
Subhedar Tanhaji Malusare.

01:38:20.253 --> 01:38:21.337
No.

01:38:22.753 --> 01:38:24.587
Swaraj will be victorious.

01:38:24.753 --> 01:38:26.128
Truth will be victorious.

01:38:26.503 --> 01:38:28.128
We all will be victorious.

01:38:28.628 --> 01:38:30.212
Har Har Mahadev!

01:38:30.545 --> 01:38:32.212
Har Har Mahadev!

01:38:32.295 --> 01:38:33.920
Har Har Mahadev!

01:38:34.003 --> 01:38:36.003
Har Har Mahadev!

01:38:51.307 --> 01:38:52.349
You are here?

01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:20.087
Does everyone remember their part?

01:39:20.337 --> 01:39:21.670
Yes Subhedar!

01:39:21.753 --> 01:39:24.878
Along with Tatya-Shiru,
Gorpade brothers and fifty soldiers..

01:39:25.503 --> 01:39:27.337
..I will climb Dronagiri cliff.

01:39:29.753 --> 01:39:32.837
We'll accomplish this task
that's impossible for others.

01:39:33.295 --> 01:39:36.420
And I shall wait at Kalyan
darwaza (door) with 300 soldiers.

01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:45.587
And I will climb up the secret passageway
and open the Kalyan darwaza (door).

01:39:48.462 --> 01:39:50.420
And we'll attack as
soon as the door opens.

01:39:50.503 --> 01:39:51.837
The attack will be
from both the sides.

01:39:51.912 --> 01:39:53.245
Surya and I will
attack from the front..

01:39:53.337 --> 01:39:54.795
..and you from the back
along with 50 soldiers.

01:39:54.878 --> 01:39:56.962
We will take over the
Jhunjhar buruj (bastion).

01:39:58.212 --> 01:39:59.628
And then Sadar (Court).

01:40:00.087 --> 01:40:01.295
Sign of capture.

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:05.128
Cuckoo sound..Koo..Hoo.

01:40:05.212 --> 01:40:06.378
Sign of danger.

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:09.128
Giddya's voice..

01:40:09.295 --> 01:40:10.462
Not mine..

01:40:10.962 --> 01:40:12.420
The owl's sound.

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.628
The way every particle
of soil has a mountain..

01:40:23.253 --> 01:40:26.628
..every seed has a forest,
and every sword an army..

01:40:27.253 --> 01:40:30.337
..likewise, inside each
Maratha is a million Maratha.

01:40:35.712 --> 01:40:37.587
This is our final conversation.

01:40:39.087 --> 01:40:42.378
We shall meet again on Kondhana.

01:41:44.696 --> 01:41:46.209
Call the Ghorpade brothers.

01:43:39.534 --> 01:43:43.236
Laxman, pull..pull it upward.

01:43:47.719 --> 01:43:49.471
Laxman, stop.

01:43:56.813 --> 01:43:58.673
No! No!

01:44:00.255 --> 01:44:02.475
Glory to Mahadev!

01:44:02.555 --> 01:44:04.250
Laxman, no!

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:11.685
Magic. Magic. Magic. Magic.

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:28.733
I would have been injured.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:43.099
Brother, no news of Tanhaji yet.

01:46:45.479 --> 01:46:47.063
Have faith in destiny.

01:47:25.622 --> 01:47:27.899
Sire, Marathas have scaled the fort.

01:47:33.361 --> 01:47:35.381
WHAT? HOW?

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:52.390
Magic.

01:49:21.861 --> 01:49:23.971
Sire, we've lost the
Kalyan Darwaza (door).

01:49:24.051 --> 01:49:25.528
Now Maha Darwaza (Main
door) is the last hope.

01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:33.291
Magic. Magic.

01:54:46.654 --> 01:54:47.882
Turn the cannon,

01:54:48.859 --> 01:54:50.675
Aim at Rajgad.

01:54:50.863 --> 01:54:51.883
Yes sire.

01:55:02.983 --> 01:55:04.661
Charge ahead!

01:58:49.482 --> 01:58:52.008
One battle is going on at Kondhana..

01:58:53.602 --> 01:58:55.623
..another one in my heart.

01:58:58.015 --> 01:59:00.982
I want to take soldiers
and leave for Kondhana right now.

01:59:02.651 --> 01:59:05.185
Subhedar Tanhaji made
you take a vow, Raje.

01:59:06.543 --> 01:59:10.729
You shall not leave Rajgad
until he sends a message.

01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:13.678
My tears are not stopping..

01:59:15.425 --> 01:59:17.847
..that means, he must be bleeding.

01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:21.734
Make the preparations, Pant.

01:59:22.364 --> 01:59:24.578
We're breaking the
vow we made to Tanhya.

02:01:45.817 --> 02:01:48.734
People leave behind many possessions.

02:01:49.192 --> 02:01:51.859
I am leaving you behind with a debt.

02:01:52.485 --> 02:01:54.359
'Freedom of our motherland.'

02:04:10.577 --> 02:04:11.410
Aau Saheb.

02:04:26.394 --> 02:04:27.942
Final salutation Raje.

02:04:59.650 --> 02:05:01.345
The fort is conquered..

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:05.790
..but I lost my lion.

02:05:14.938 --> 02:05:19.109
That day, the benefactor
of millions wept intensely.

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:23.942
Tanhya was draped in the Saffron
(Maratha flag) after conquering Kondhana.

02:05:24.215 --> 02:05:29.900
Aurangzeb's dream of capturing
the whole of India remained a dream.

02:05:34.048 --> 02:05:38.798
Shivaji Raje himself arrived at Umrath and
performed the rites of Raiba's wedding.

02:06:04.798 --> 02:06:09.631
And in a closed room,
Savitri kept her promise.

02:06:16.525 --> 02:06:18.109
I know you will win.

02:06:18.484 --> 02:06:20.359
And the gift will be whatever you want.

02:06:21.124 --> 02:06:22.749
Then promise me.

02:06:23.484 --> 02:06:26.067
You will welcome me dressed as a bride.
