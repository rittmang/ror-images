WEBVTT

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.905
So Karunesh brought along his girlfriend.

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.763
I told him they could share
the lower bed of the bunk bed.

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.213
We'll go upstairs.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.356
He could enjoy some privacy.

00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:16.352
He said okay.

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:20.425
In the night, Mohanti from the
second floor made their MMS.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.983
And forwarded it to me.

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:24.127
The next morning, he got angry and started shouting.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:26.025
Tell me, how is it my fault?

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.748
Have you heard of Ronald Wayne?

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:30.469
What?

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:31.549
Who?

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.210
Have you heard of him?

00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:35.952
Was he Batman's father?

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:39.028
He was an entrepreneur.

00:00:47.087 --> 00:00:48.954
But nobobdy knows about him.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:51.220
Do you know what is the
name of that company?

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.026
What?

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.599
Everyone knows Steve Jobs.

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.717
Some people even know Steve Wozniak.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:07.191
But nobody remembers the third guy's name.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.233
And I'm supposed to be
the fourth guy here.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.538
Did Yogi say something?

00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.924
Don't feel bad about what he says.

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:20.346
A balding man is bound to get a bit cranky.

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:22.953
He can't say anything.

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:25.651
I'm going to hit him real hard one day.

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:27.276
He hasn't faced my anger.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.800
But Jeetu?

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:30.965
I called him last month

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:33.762
to tell him banks will be closed next month, on the 1st.

00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:35.352
And there's a weekend after that.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.854
So he'll recieve his salary slightly late.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.012
He cut the phone.

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:44.314
When I went to tell this to
Naveen, you know what he said?

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:47.993
You go make tea.

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:58.508
Sometimes I feel like I don't matter.

00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:02.256
Naveen gives the presentation,

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.041
Jeetu makes the code,

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:05.745
Yogi meets the vendors.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.166
Nobody gives me any work.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.770
Don't worry about these little things.

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:15.821
Look at me,

00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:19.658
I've been fighting since
fourteen years, and look at you

00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:23.141
You're about to get seed funding
in the next six months.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.573
And that too from Plutus Atlantic.

00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:28.671
You're just left with the partner meeting,

00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:32.780
after that look at the kind of respect
you get in the marketplace.

00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:36.208
I don't want respect from the whole market.

00:02:37.643 --> 00:02:39.422
Just three people.

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:40.808
So show it to them.

00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:42.959
Show them your dedication.

00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:45.311
Give the start-up your everything.

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:48.178
Once they notice it, they'll start respecting you.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.433
How else do I show my decication?

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:55.071
I'm the one who works 5
days in a week for Jeetu.

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:57.141
I'm exhausted by the end of the day,

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:59.714
but I still make dinner for Yogi and Naveen.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:00.955
All the time, I

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:02.078
Where did it go?

00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:04.159
I carry this pen drive with me.

00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:07.105
How much more dedication do I show them?

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:10.495
Why do you carry this pen drive everywhere?

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:30.159
I update it after every meeting.

00:03:30.798 --> 00:03:34.867
Last year when I went to New
York, I got it for 5 dollars.

00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.444
But you'll see, one day this will
get us five billion dollars.

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:46.495
Drink this.

00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:48.281
Chill out.

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:49.502
No, no, please.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.580
My digestion gets upset
by these local drinks.

00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:56.795
Don't worry.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.186
This is the Rastogi Special.

00:03:59.354 --> 00:04:02.754
This is what we were selling
in our sixth start-up.

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:07.662
The name was slightly insensitive.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.811
Or Tiger Global would have
been on board in seconds.

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.275
Jeetu's wife is so hot.

00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:34.878
Really?

00:04:36.763 --> 00:04:41.363
I don't know where does my mom get
these stupid girls for me to meet.

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:44.037
I asked a girl, how did she like Avataar and she said

00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:53.338
Sorry, I'll be back in two minutes, I got to...

00:04:56.517 --> 00:04:57.517
Come soon.

00:04:57.982 --> 00:04:59.649
You have to pay the bill.

00:06:03.784 --> 00:06:08.374
If they ask you about the salary, just tell
them you'll think about it and tell them.

00:06:08.747 --> 00:06:11.614
Tell the HR guys you'll manage your own travel.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.971
People get happy in as much.

00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:18.237
Guys I've booked an Uber,
it'll be here in 5 minutes.

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:19.426
Dude, Naveen?

00:06:19.518 --> 00:06:22.118
Come here, I need to double check once.

00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:28.103
If my VP promotion
wasn't dependent upon

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:30.368
your funding, I won't
have fought so hard for you guys.

00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:32.772
It's because the product is
promising that I've kept quiet.

00:06:32.907 --> 00:06:35.776
Don't tell me that, I've
been ready since last night.

00:06:35.923 --> 00:06:37.789
I even slept with my tie on.

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.479
Please come.

00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:42.162
Give me one minute.

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:46.593
In the drawer in the cupboard
there must be a white packet.

00:06:46.685 --> 00:06:47.661
Yes, the Kalyani Saree one.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.959
It has your passport,
certificates, everything.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.367
What's going on with him?

00:06:53.422 --> 00:06:54.990
Soumya has her job interview today.

00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:58.789
His post modern, post marriage love story
has been going on since two hours.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.886
Have you seen my pendrive?

00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:03.064
Which pen drive?

00:07:04.054 --> 00:07:06.453
Yogi has already taken
2-3 backups of the presentation.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560
6-7.

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:11.336
No, none of these.

00:07:11.928 --> 00:07:12.995
Please sit down.

00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:16.053
Shift a bit.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.450
Just sit down man.

00:07:18.123 --> 00:07:19.656
What are you doing man?

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:21.433
Yes, just go from here.

00:07:21.777 --> 00:07:23.187
Naveen, what is going on man?

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.476
Come on, what are you doing?

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.424
I only slept for four hours.
Let me wash my face atleast.

00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:30.889
We're getting primary funding today.

00:07:31.494 --> 00:07:33.923
My face deserves to
shine like my fate, right?

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.599
You guys are taking this very lightly.

00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:38.340
I've been saying this since day one.

00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:42.596
People liking your idea in the firm has
nothing to do with the seed funding.

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:47.909
Half an hour is left.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.047
Come out. Let's go.

00:07:50.764 --> 00:07:52.031
How much time guys?

00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:53.619
Switch this off.

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:55.020
Okay, I'm sitting.

00:07:55.155 --> 00:07:57.254
No, you don't have to sit. Stand up.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.915
Please don't get late because
of these temple rituals.

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:02.063
Okay, I'll go now.

00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:05.494
Listen, I've kept parathas in the bowl.
Do eat them.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.405
And there's curd and sugar in the fridge.
Have that too.

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:10.862
Wish her from my side too.

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:12.287
Naveen's saying all the best.

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:13.460
From my side too.

00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:15.534
Can't you all say it at once?

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:20.856
No, nothing. Puneet is here,
he's also wishing you luck. Okay, I'll talk to you later.

00:08:23.414 --> 00:08:26.338
You guys know that ideally I
shouldn't even be here, right?

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:27.552
Why have I come?

00:08:28.427 --> 00:08:29.960
Guys, most importantly.

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:37.961
Who are you guys going to meet?

00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:44.270
Do you have any idea who he is?

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.506
They call him 'Midas Bharadwaj' in VC circles.

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:48.128
Whatever he does

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:48.891
One minute.

00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:50.967
Is it Mide-us or Mid-aas?

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.094
You're from State Board. Keep quiet.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.436
His portfolio has 17 multi-million dollar
companies and 0 in his anti-portfolio.

00:08:57.464 --> 00:08:59.083
What is anti-portfolio?

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:02.217
What is an investor's portfolio?

00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:08.477
So what would be anti?

00:09:15.474 --> 00:09:19.208
Bharadwaj's profile doesn't
have an anti-profile header.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:21.912
Now, if he rejects your idea,

00:09:23.137 --> 00:09:27.537
noone in Bombay or Bangalore is
going to support your start-up.

00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:30.123
Now, you guys don't want to go to Delhi

00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:32.496
and neither do I want to
just remain an analyst.

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:34.224
So let's focus together.

00:09:34.362 --> 00:09:35.362
Okay?

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.893
Our product is good.

00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:45.462
We've worked very hard.

00:09:48.862 --> 00:09:52.645
And as you enter, compliment
him on his TED talk. He'll be happy.

00:09:55.544 --> 00:09:57.655
Let's go, quickly. Naveen
close your top button.

00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:58.754
I can't find it.

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:00.267
Hurry up guys.

00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:03.571
I'm just wearing my shoes.

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:04.813
You're again wearing my socks?

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:06.685
No, these are my own socks.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.350
Jeetu, your demo is set?

00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:11.869
Everything's fine? Did
you put an fb login?

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:12.512
No.

00:10:12.972 --> 00:10:13.972
I'll just do it.

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.417
The tie isn't a problem, right?

00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:20.202
No, it's fine. What are you saying? A
coder may even come in his underpants.

00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:45.032
Sir, we saw your TED talk. It
was very thought provoking.

00:10:45.057 --> 00:10:45.667
Which one?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.180
The California one or
the Vancouver one?

00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:49.584
We saw both of them.

00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:52.578
The Vancouver one is next month.

00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:10.011
I missed breakfast so my wife
is punishing me with these oats.

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:17.201
No, I'm not accusing anybody.

00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:27.232
But we thought about this in college and

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.595
We came up with this idea in college.

00:12:37.993 --> 00:12:39.699
We've been planning this since 3-4 years.

00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:42.056
I'm not a detective.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.833
Can you tell us the names of the people who

00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:16.788
You guys,

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.504
are here, on this island.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.915
Comfortable with your idea.

00:13:28.957 --> 00:13:29.957
And I am

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.351
over here.

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.044
On this island.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.570
Now you guys have to
come from there to here.

00:13:44.842 --> 00:13:46.109
There are two ways.

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:06.146
I don't know if you guys will
be able to make it here or not.

00:14:08.209 --> 00:14:10.091
There is another way.

00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:13.797
That's called...

00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:22.391
I can send this boat to you guys.

00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:25.191
You guys can sit in it and

00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:28.553
comfortably reach over here.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.586
And I can send my boat,

00:14:41.244 --> 00:14:43.569
only in one direction.

00:15:11.106 --> 00:15:14.240
Hey, I called you because
it's confidential.

00:15:15.401 --> 00:15:17.951
Fine. If your promotion is
at stake, what can one do.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.937
Okay. I'll see you next weekend. Bye.

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:26.742
Bharadwaj is not going to tell us.

00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:27.963
And

00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:30.977
the Bangalore team is tight lipped too.

00:15:31.424 --> 00:15:33.011
Realistically, it's hard to find out.

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:34.933
Puneet, why don't you try once.

00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:36.382
I am trying guys but

00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.209
There's another problem.

00:15:38.534 --> 00:15:40.914
Bharadwaj is leaving for
Dubai day afer tomorrow.

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:41.708
So then?

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:44.742
I'll fix a second meeting
tomorrrow and sort this out.

00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:45.941
You guys don't worry.

00:15:46.027 --> 00:15:47.782
Sit here. I have a couple of contacts,

00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:49.435
I'll call them and come.

00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:53.596
Are you sure it's not

00:15:53.623 --> 00:15:55.069
Puneet who leaked our idea?

00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:59.618
No, man. What are you saying?
His own promotion is due.

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:04.759
What is the problem Shreya?

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:06.681
You know I have a meeting today.

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:08.916
Why are you calling repeatedly?

00:16:10.054 --> 00:16:11.054
No,

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.895
There's a big problem here.

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:16.257
I can't come right now.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.504
But what happened?
Tell me atleast?

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:23.970
Okay, fine. I'm coming.

00:16:26.565 --> 00:16:28.258
Guys, I'm coming in 20 minutes.

00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:31.262
In case Puneet gives any
updates, inform me.

00:16:33.602 --> 00:16:36.176
After going home, first thing,
I'll have to make a list.

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.605
Of probable suspects.

00:16:37.658 --> 00:16:38.522
How will that help?

00:16:39.775 --> 00:16:41.952
I have a lot of
experience with thievery.

00:16:41.977 --> 00:16:43.485
When I was in the first year of my MBA,

00:16:43.548 --> 00:16:46.034
every alternate day, my bucket used to get stolen.

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:47.233
So I made a list

00:16:47.242 --> 00:16:48.697
and applied the base theorem.

00:16:48.745 --> 00:16:51.745
Every time, the culprit
was from my building.

00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:54.592
I have a hunch it's somebody we know.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.435
Mandal, where's your pen drive?

00:16:59.514 --> 00:17:01.533
I don't know man, can't find it.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:03.596
Last weekend I went to meet Rastogi,

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:05.090
since then it's

00:17:09.913 --> 00:17:12.513
All the demos and tablets were in that.

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:13.673
Call Rastogi.

00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:14.881
Call him.

00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:24.318
Put it on speaker.

00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.571
He's sitting in Bangalore.

00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:32.273
He's gone there and pitched it.

00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:34.012
We'll have to go to Bangalore or what?

00:17:34.037 --> 00:17:35.227
Mother fucker, you'll go to Bangalore?

00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:39.049
He'll be sitting at Kormangla
coffee shop and shaking it for you?

00:17:39.482 --> 00:17:41.146
Shut up asshole.

00:17:44.235 --> 00:17:47.568
You had to do nothing and
you fucked up even that.

00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:50.929
Since Day 1, I told Naveen not to take him.

00:17:50.954 --> 00:17:55.119
We can stand 0 contribution but how the
fuck can we bear negative contribution?

00:17:55.177 --> 00:17:56.177
Fucker.

00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.810
By now we would have had the term sheet.

00:18:02.216 --> 00:18:04.549
Why are you talking like this Yogi?

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:08.291
I didn't do it deliberately.

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:09.691
You couldn't have done it deliberately.

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:10.335
Want to know why?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.129
Because you're a dumbfuck.

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:11.579
Enough Yogi.

00:18:11.604 --> 00:18:12.320
Wait a second.

00:18:12.761 --> 00:18:14.028
You are a dumbfuck.

00:18:14.145 --> 00:18:15.697
The entire world knows you're a dumbfuck.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.201
And even you know you're a dumbfuck.

00:18:17.307 --> 00:18:19.507
Why are you talking like this Yogi?

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:22.101
Yes, I've made a mistake,

00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:23.613
but we're friends.

00:18:23.718 --> 00:18:24.556
Really?

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:26.611
Except us, where are your other friends?

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.933
And when we're busy,

00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:30.923
why the fuck do you have only
Rastogi to go drinking with?

00:18:31.638 --> 00:18:35.346
Fucker, do you know why in the entire batch
only your bucket used to get stolen?

00:18:35.391 --> 00:18:36.457
Because you are one.

00:18:36.846 --> 00:18:37.846
A big one.

00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:40.231
And you know this shit
that we're going through?

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.163
Is becaue we're getting punished for
having dumbfucks like you in our team.

00:18:45.778 --> 00:18:46.778
Okay.

00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:52.289
You guys won't have to
suffer more because of me.

00:19:04.786 --> 00:19:05.786
Go on man.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.683
For once take a stand in life.
Don't come back wagging your tail.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.408
What are you doing man?

00:19:28.098 --> 00:19:29.772
Just one minute.

00:19:32.749 --> 00:19:34.165
Aunty, one second.

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:35.235
Aunty, who?

00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:38.408
Ma'am, please move this back a bit.

00:19:40.853 --> 00:19:42.701
Just come on that side.

00:19:46.955 --> 00:19:48.030
What is this nonsense?

00:19:48.075 --> 00:19:49.803
You're never this unreasonable.

00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:51.972
I'm sitting in a meeting and
you're calling me again and again.

00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:56.073
Yeah, what about it?

00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:57.608
You had rejected it, right?

00:19:57.652 --> 00:20:01.012
Yes, but there are new vacancies in their London office.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:07.869
For how long?

00:20:26.543 --> 00:20:28.151
Have you decided?

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:29.862
No, I

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:48.936
What do I say?

00:20:49.997 --> 00:20:53.331
If you were in my place,
what would you have done?

00:21:14.421 --> 00:21:16.554
Mandal's switched off his phone.

00:21:16.687 --> 00:21:18.397
Why do you get so angry man?

00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:19.593
Where will he go?

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.884
After drinking beer,
he'll come back home.

00:21:21.973 --> 00:21:22.651
He's Mandal.

00:21:22.687 --> 00:21:24.866
If he does something crazy,
you'll take resbonsibility?

00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:28.821
Look, your loser's here.

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:32.119
Must be Soumya. I asked her to
come here after the interview.

00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:33.445
Listen.

00:21:33.812 --> 00:21:37.410
Don't say anything in front of her.
Even her mood will get spoilt.

00:21:49.614 --> 00:21:51.227
I got it!

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:53.906
The interview went so well,

00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:55.998
they'll send an offer letter day after and

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:58.008
I'm going to join them from next week!

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.666
Congrats Soumya.

00:22:06.044 --> 00:22:07.644
Sorry, I didn't see you.

00:22:07.711 --> 00:22:09.925
No, you guys carry on.
I'll go inside.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.056
No, please stay.

00:22:11.489 --> 00:22:12.756
I got this for you.

00:22:13.526 --> 00:22:14.716
What is this? Sweets?

00:22:14.946 --> 00:22:15.847
No, they're visiting cards.

00:22:15.872 --> 00:22:17.344
Vista Print has sent it.

00:22:17.388 --> 00:22:18.958
They were delivered today morning.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.354
Actually he was saying the previous
cards weren't good quality so

00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:27.021
How did your thing go?

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.050
It was good.

00:22:29.187 --> 00:22:30.792
The presentation also went well.

00:22:30.898 --> 00:22:31.779
It was good.

00:22:31.868 --> 00:22:34.068
Response was good. Demo was good.

00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:37.412
Let's see, we're pitching
it, talks have started.

00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:38.996
It was good.

00:22:39.487 --> 00:22:40.820
Did you talk to dad?

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.550
No.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.891
I was only able to speak to dad.

00:22:45.026 --> 00:22:47.454
Dad was also asking about you and dad.

00:22:47.502 --> 00:22:49.302
I think dad is doubting us.

00:22:49.337 --> 00:22:51.607
I thought I should talk to
you first and then dad.

00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:53.900
Why? You can talk to dad.

00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:57.804
How do married couples understand
whose dad is being referred to?

00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:02.986
Okay, I can talk to him.
But what do I say?

00:23:03.536 --> 00:23:05.321
The same thing you tell him everytime.

00:23:05.782 --> 00:23:07.980
We disagree with him, we don't disrespect him.

00:23:08.036 --> 00:23:09.956
Atleast call him once and tell him.

00:23:12.211 --> 00:23:13.411
Puneet is calling.

00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:18.045
This is Yogi.

00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:20.284
Yogi, we haven't been able
to find the name directly.

00:23:20.409 --> 00:23:23.996
But I've been able to find Bharadwaj's
schedule for the last week.

00:23:24.242 --> 00:23:28.042
I have the details of everyone
he's met in the past week.

00:23:29.006 --> 00:23:31.873
Can you see the name 'Rastogi' in the list?

00:23:32.133 --> 00:23:33.990
Check for Rastogi once.

00:23:35.323 --> 00:23:38.559
No, you typed Pastogi.
R for Rastogi.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.829
No man, there's no Rastogi.

00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:44.334
Rastogi isn't there.

00:23:44.794 --> 00:23:47.278
Puneet why don't you start alphabetically.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.223
Tell me all the names, starting with A.

00:23:50.123 --> 00:23:52.299
There's Azim Premji.
There are numerous names

00:23:52.324 --> 00:23:54.329
starting with A. I've cross
checked all of them.

00:23:56.687 --> 00:23:58.321
There is only one slot left.

00:23:58.393 --> 00:24:01.460
I don't see a name  but there's an e-mail id.

00:24:02.012 --> 00:24:03.279
What's the mail id?

00:24:03.627 --> 00:24:05.094
It's something weird.

00:24:05.913 --> 00:24:06.913
Yes.

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:34.316
You found this place to talk
about something so important?

00:24:34.547 --> 00:24:37.919
We could have sat in some
restaurant and talked properly.

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:47.578
Good to see your sense of humour is still intact.

00:24:47.766 --> 00:24:52.166
And good to see that your 'career comes
first' ideology is still intact.

00:24:57.591 --> 00:24:58.591
Say it.

00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:05.096
Can't you say it once? 'I love you. I can't
stay without you. Please don't leave me.'

00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:08.234
I can't stay without you.

00:25:08.933 --> 00:25:09.933
But please go.

00:25:30.564 --> 00:25:32.409
I'm telling you, there's still time.

00:25:32.647 --> 00:25:35.671
I'll give you a coin. Use the
trial room as the 'jury room'.

00:25:35.742 --> 00:25:37.542
That won't change anything.

00:25:48.092 --> 00:25:50.158
You've become very predictable.

00:25:50.346 --> 00:25:53.879
You're not going to instigate me.
Please stop trying.

00:26:02.315 --> 00:26:07.115
You realise it's going to be every
tough to find this combination again?

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.704
It'll be impossible.

00:26:09.205 --> 00:26:11.901
But what do we do? It's your work.
You'll have to do it.

00:26:15.829 --> 00:26:18.601
Naveen, that's just something to say.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.820
None of us are Gandhi, Newton or Shakespeare.

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:29.719
That's not true Shreya.

00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:32.876
Okay, wait.

00:26:35.003 --> 00:26:36.003
What is this?

00:26:37.102 --> 00:26:38.102
Your head.

00:26:40.142 --> 00:26:41.275
Come on, tell me. What is this?

00:26:41.467 --> 00:26:42.728
It's a bottle. What else.

00:26:42.761 --> 00:26:43.761
Who made it?

00:26:44.713 --> 00:26:45.846
How would I know?

00:26:46.294 --> 00:26:49.087
You know thousands of years ago, when man lived in caves.

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:57.914
So when man used to go fill water from
the river, he used to face lots of problems.

00:26:58.072 --> 00:27:00.728
Then someone made a
container out of leaves.

00:27:00.758 --> 00:27:02.358
But that wasn't durable.

00:27:02.792 --> 00:27:07.135
Then someone noticed that if you put wet
mud in the sun, it transforms into clay.

00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:09.054
And then someone made a pot.

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:11.285
But even that wasn't durable.

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:13.562
Then someone discovered plastic.

00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:18.004
And someone else came up with the
idea of making a plastic container.

00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:21.636
Them someone else designed it's shape,
some one else made it transparent,

00:27:21.668 --> 00:27:25.441
Someone else discovered the cap, someone
else designed the threads of the cap.

00:27:25.483 --> 00:27:28.083
And someone else made a bottle factory.

00:27:28.141 --> 00:27:32.208
And today, thousands of people work in that
factory just to make bottles.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.366
Which means, since thousands of years,
thousands of people have been working.

00:27:35.439 --> 00:27:38.377
Just so that today we could
have a bottle in our hands.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.060
Maybe we don't acknowledge it but

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:46.432
And this is just a bottle Shreya.

00:27:46.508 --> 00:27:47.974
Look around yourself.

00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:07.880
Will you miss me?

00:28:14.884 --> 00:28:15.884
Will you?

00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:18.289
Every night.

00:28:19.725 --> 00:28:20.792
Bloody horndog.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.615
I'm going to have to manage
someway or the other.

00:28:24.822 --> 00:28:25.822
Okay, listen.

00:28:26.338 --> 00:28:29.204
Promise me you'll give
me a 3 months window.

00:28:29.338 --> 00:28:31.528
Don't get a new girlfriend before that.

00:28:31.925 --> 00:28:35.749
Okay. You also please don't start uploading
selfies the minute you're in London.

00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:37.138
Okay. Done.

00:28:46.403 --> 00:28:48.936
We were kind of like soulmates, right?

00:28:49.339 --> 00:28:52.101
If I stayed back, we would
have definitely got married.

00:28:52.403 --> 00:28:53.403
You got lucky.

00:29:04.069 --> 00:29:07.202
We never got stuck in the
technicalities baby.

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:09.947
No, I was saying that becasue

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.930
we should have break-up sex
for the last time, right?

00:29:16.645 --> 00:29:19.202
I'm going home today evening, for a week.

00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:21.841
Once I'm back, let's have some fun.

00:29:39.414 --> 00:29:42.748
I have a flight in the evening and
I haven't even started packing.

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.082
Okay?

00:30:05.391 --> 00:30:06.070
What is this?

00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:09.570
Why are you giving me your credit card?
What rubbish.

00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:11.638
Why are you acting like a hero?

00:30:12.244 --> 00:30:14.377
I know your financial situation.

00:30:15.942 --> 00:30:18.076
A month's groceries on me, okay?

00:30:19.188 --> 00:30:20.188
And anyway,

00:30:20.815 --> 00:30:22.815
it's not a gift, it's a loan.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.300
I'll take it back.

00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:28.011
Okay?

00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:52.298
I've made a lot of sacrifices for the start-up.

00:30:52.893 --> 00:30:53.893
A good job.

00:30:54.556 --> 00:30:55.556
A good salary.

00:30:55.905 --> 00:30:57.705
A good standard of living.

00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:01.225
It never bothered me so much.

00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:05.958
But this time, I have to sacrifice you for work.

00:31:09.177 --> 00:31:10.310
It really hurts.

00:31:24.237 --> 00:31:25.232
And when,

00:31:25.478 --> 00:31:30.611
I'll see your face on the cover of TIME
magazine, then this will all seem worth it.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.062
That's why my inbox is full
with hair therapy mails.

00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:04.907
He's been making a fool
out of us since 6 monhs.

00:32:04.994 --> 00:32:06.577
And you were planning to replace me with him?

00:32:06.627 --> 00:32:09.066
Come on man, it was a time of financial crunch.

00:32:09.153 --> 00:32:10.516
Learn to say sorry Yogi.

00:32:10.634 --> 00:32:12.119
I can't do all this man.

00:32:12.228 --> 00:32:15.669
But these fuckers are going to apologise,
when I attest their asses with my shoe.

00:32:16.514 --> 00:32:17.747
You please keep quiet.

00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:20.326
It's been enough since morning.
Now, let me talk politely.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.886
You talk to them. But if they act
smart, I'm going to fuck them.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.378
They're 17 yeard old kids.

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:28.857
They made a mistake. I'll talk
to them, they'll understand.

00:32:29.189 --> 00:32:30.189
Okay fine.

00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:31.072
You talk.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:31.801
I whack.

00:32:32.631 --> 00:32:33.631
Let's go.

00:32:34.044 --> 00:32:37.319
They're lucky I'm not
wearing my Woodland shoes.

00:32:45.726 --> 00:32:47.259
What happened here man?

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:49.629
I don't see any kids either.

00:33:18.635 --> 00:33:19.635
What is this?

00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:22.856
Did someone take a dump here? Oh, yuck.

00:33:26.412 --> 00:33:28.679
Where are we man? What's going on?

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.554
Let's go man. Which one is it?

00:33:56.195 --> 00:33:57.580
Welcome Yogi.

00:33:59.035 --> 00:34:00.701
We were waiting for you.

00:34:00.781 --> 00:34:02.581
You guys knew we're coming?

00:34:02.678 --> 00:34:05.347
No, we sit idol everyday from 8-10.

00:34:08.226 --> 00:34:13.045
Fool, the CCTV footage of the
main gate is screened here.

00:34:14.188 --> 00:34:16.654
The entry is done. Can I go home now?

00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:18.038
Yes, okay.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:20.336
You'll take me for a spa
in the evening right?

00:34:28.497 --> 00:34:29.497
Look guys.

00:34:30.505 --> 00:34:32.474
You guys must know why we're here.

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:35.688
We've worked very hard for this product.

00:34:35.746 --> 00:34:38.343
You guys have made a mistake and it's illegal too.

00:34:38.778 --> 00:34:42.445
You guys are young. We don't
want to file a complaint.

00:34:42.761 --> 00:34:44.153
You made a mistake, it's alright.

00:34:44.319 --> 00:34:46.852
Just call Bharadwaj once and backout.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.182
We won't take any action.

00:34:58.812 --> 00:35:02.527
If you track the IP address, you'll
find a cyber cafe in Mulund.

00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:04.694
Nobody can even touch us.

00:35:06.424 --> 00:35:08.849
We have all the proof that this idea is ours.

00:35:09.052 --> 00:35:10.385
We're advising you.

00:35:10.437 --> 00:35:11.519
You guys are in college.

00:35:11.577 --> 00:35:13.373
There could be an issue if
your parents found out.

00:35:13.669 --> 00:35:16.135
You guys must be scared
of your fathers.

00:35:16.997 --> 00:35:19.663
If our parents had the time to scold us,

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:22.278
you think we would have
turned out to be such dicks?

00:35:26.903 --> 00:35:28.916
One second Jeetu. Give me your phone.

00:35:29.192 --> 00:35:33.073
Let me show these guys whether to
call Bharadwaj or for an ambulance.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.557
Give me the phone.

00:35:36.892 --> 00:35:38.159
Have you met Reddy?

00:35:40.103 --> 00:35:42.469
Reddy loved to video-chat.

00:35:43.658 --> 00:35:46.325
He had found a Bulgarian girl on Omegle.

00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:50.129
And the entire night on skype he used to...

00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:56.758
What he didn't know was that I
was recording the entire chat.

00:35:57.879 --> 00:35:59.746
One day, I felt like it

00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:02.345
So I put all the videos on the internet.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.512
He cried, begged.

00:36:05.012 --> 00:36:07.212
So I finally deleted the videos.

00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:09.798
And he's supposed to be my friend.

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.369
You are my dad's,

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:16.091
third cousin's mutual friend.

00:36:17.481 --> 00:36:19.614
You'll login tonight at 1 again?

00:36:19.647 --> 00:36:21.447
Svetlanna is a single mom.

00:36:21.536 --> 00:36:23.298
And also an entrepreneur in many ways.

00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:25.119
It's material worth 41 GB.

00:36:26.354 --> 00:36:28.687
Reddy's got a new hard drive for it.

00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:31.213
It really hepled on dry days man.

00:36:31.624 --> 00:36:33.091
Say thanks to her too.

00:36:35.347 --> 00:36:37.456
Touch us if you can.

00:36:38.338 --> 00:36:41.147
We've got a free router
with the new computer.

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:42.899
We'll get to test the upload speed too.

00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:43.939
Please guys.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.090
Bill

00:36:45.487 --> 00:36:47.953
stole Steve's idea and made Microsoft.

00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:50.577
So who do you think you are?

00:36:51.116 --> 00:36:53.516
Go back the same road you came from.

00:36:53.798 --> 00:36:56.147
If you go to meet
Bharadwaj again,

00:36:56.172 --> 00:36:59.131
Yogi and Svetlanna's folder,

00:36:59.156 --> 00:37:01.254
won't just remain in Reddy's folder.

00:37:02.163 --> 00:37:03.496
Okay, let's go Yogi.

00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:10.051
Mother fuckers.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.789
They were going to make me back-out.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.980
Hey Jeetu.

00:37:16.115 --> 00:37:17.849
Come on man, convince me.

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:21.446
Come and convince me
that I should back out.

00:37:21.568 --> 00:37:23.788
Come and convince me man.

00:37:30.048 --> 00:37:31.181
What did you say?

00:37:31.627 --> 00:37:32.760
What did you say?

00:37:33.206 --> 00:37:34.555
Convince me.

00:37:34.616 --> 00:37:36.082
I should convince you?

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.946
What are you doing?

00:37:51.076 --> 00:37:52.735
I should convince this asshole?

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:56.637
First I convince my wife,
then my dad, then my family.

00:37:56.982 --> 00:37:58.807
This mother fucker is 17 years old.

00:37:59.052 --> 00:37:59.648
Fuck him.

00:38:36.393 --> 00:38:38.432
Fuck, my i7 extreme gaming edition.

00:38:40.044 --> 00:38:41.577
Are you guys gangsters?

00:38:41.834 --> 00:38:43.234
We're not gangsters.

00:38:43.453 --> 00:38:45.250
We're entrepreneurs.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:17.256
Do you guys know how much one has to
pay to admit a child in kindergarden?

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:20.535
How much goes into an EMI of a house?

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.687
Yesterday, I went to buy
vegetables after office.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.414
Do you know how much babycorn is for?

00:39:26.533 --> 00:39:28.168
100gms for Rs.120.

00:39:28.367 --> 00:39:30.833
What are you saying? 1200 bucks a kg?

00:39:34.116 --> 00:39:35.449
What did I want man?

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.891
For you guys to get your seed fund
and for me my promotion.

00:39:39.108 --> 00:39:40.708
Was it that big a demand?

00:39:41.616 --> 00:39:44.528
A problem came up and 25
percent of the team resigned.

00:39:44.592 --> 00:39:46.758
He's switched off his phone.
What can we do?

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:47.599
Dude.

00:39:47.703 --> 00:39:49.636
Naveen, say something to him.

00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:52.851
I'm tired of talking. You go ahead.

00:39:53.205 --> 00:39:54.871
I was backing this team.

00:39:55.117 --> 00:39:58.307
The CEO comes sleep deprived
and unwashed for the meeting.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:39:59.962
This CEO abuses people.

00:40:00.004 --> 00:40:01.738
This CTO breaks computers.

00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:06.308
You guys are a million dollar team.
How come you didn't get funding earlier?

00:40:11.247 --> 00:40:13.314
Okay, it's all in the past now.

00:40:13.512 --> 00:40:15.520
Please don't open your mouth in front of Bharadwaj.

00:40:15.695 --> 00:40:17.362
I will talk to him, okay?

00:40:19.916 --> 00:40:21.116
Come on, sit down.

00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:24.099
We're okay, right?

00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:18.353
You guys have worked very
hard on the product.

00:41:49.947 --> 00:41:52.147
Selling things online is an idea.

00:41:54.518 --> 00:41:55.518
Everyone is selling them.

00:42:10.448 --> 00:42:11.440
And then.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.603
If I want to do business, I have
to look at my self interest.

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:40.038
I have spent thirty five thousand
and made this presentation.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.900
Okay.

00:43:26.531 --> 00:43:29.745
There is a 'Sharmaji's
son' in all our lives.

00:43:30.603 --> 00:43:34.936
But in Bikaner's Kendriya Vidhyalya
there was Maheshwariji's son.

00:43:39.025 --> 00:43:42.625
Sir, I've never seen the
Backstreet Boys perform live.

00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:45.628
But I have seen Jeetu write codes.

00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:47.912
Continuously for 36 hours.

00:43:48.346 --> 00:43:49.346
Without sleep.

00:43:50.703 --> 00:43:54.305
He could have easily taken the
Facebook job and gone to the States.

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:59.308
But his family would have faced inconvenience,
so he didn't leave India and go.

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:04.403
And today, to start the start-up,

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.242
for the first time in his life,

00:44:06.337 --> 00:44:08.135
Jeetu's gone against his family.

00:44:09.242 --> 00:44:10.242
Why?

00:44:10.839 --> 00:44:12.305
Why did Jeetu do this?

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.244
Some people know few people.

00:44:21.922 --> 00:44:23.913
Some people know a lot of people.

00:44:24.191 --> 00:44:25.191
But Yogi,

00:44:25.414 --> 00:44:26.635
knows everybody.

00:44:27.258 --> 00:44:29.972
Naveen was telling me that when
these guys went to Gujarat,

00:44:30.036 --> 00:44:33.155
at 4 in the morning, he organised beer.

00:44:33.861 --> 00:44:35.878
He's taught me the
importance of cost cutting

00:44:35.903 --> 00:44:38.639
in operations more
than my M.B.A classes.

00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:42.985
For his own birthday, he
got a cake worth Rs.25.

00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:45.850
His CGPA was only 5.3

00:44:46.645 --> 00:44:48.911
But he got a package of 22 lakhs.

00:44:49.423 --> 00:44:51.653
If he continued working
there for 2 more years,

00:44:51.678 --> 00:44:53.769
he would have been the
Mumbai Regional Head.

00:44:54.465 --> 00:44:59.371
Still, after quitting his job, he's working
hard and running around for the start-up..

00:45:00.292 --> 00:45:02.514
Why has he decided to shed his hair?

00:45:02.681 --> 00:45:03.681
Why?

00:45:10.539 --> 00:45:12.641
Sir, I love watching films.

00:45:13.563 --> 00:45:15.038
At the end of every film,

00:45:15.155 --> 00:45:18.289
the director's name appears under ' a film by'.

00:45:18.322 --> 00:45:20.922
I used to get very angry looking at it.

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:22.786
The actor acts.

00:45:23.263 --> 00:45:24.463
The writer writes.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.440
The cinematographer shoots the film.

00:45:27.921 --> 00:45:31.955
So what does the director do that
gets him such speacial attention?

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.908
But sir because of Naveen,
I have found that

00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:45.031
it's the hardest to make
choices in real life.

00:45:47.764 --> 00:45:49.164
Sir this is his idea.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.913
It's his product.

00:45:52.391 --> 00:45:53.930
The team is also Naveen's.

00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:05.474
For the team, he's made our house the office.

00:46:05.803 --> 00:46:07.870
And his own room the godown.

00:46:08.231 --> 00:46:10.917
The guy, who wouldn't iron his own shirt,

00:46:10.996 --> 00:46:13.930
today volunteers to wash all our clothes.

00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:16.465
We've all made some sacrifices.

00:46:17.078 --> 00:46:21.212
But nobody knows how much Naveen
has sacrificed for all of us.

00:46:23.421 --> 00:46:25.088
Why is Naveen doing this?

00:46:25.356 --> 00:46:26.356
All of us.

00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:30.157
Why are we all working hard with
so much dedication and commitment?

00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:47.731
We stepped out of our
comfort zone long back.

00:46:48.004 --> 00:46:51.950
No matter how many challenges,
sacrifices, changes we have to face

00:47:00.822 --> 00:47:03.356
Sir, as an individual I have no value.

00:47:08.921 --> 00:47:10.655
But if I have their back,

00:47:11.421 --> 00:47:13.888
my net value increases ten times.

00:47:42.743 --> 00:47:44.010
The team I support

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.250
And I think you guys are forgetting that

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.384
Sir, you're also forgetting something.

00:48:18.592 --> 00:48:20.392
So what you're saying is...

00:48:27.584 --> 00:48:31.984
Do you really think we went to only
one investor with our product?

00:48:45.814 --> 00:48:47.347
If I reject your idea,

00:48:48.766 --> 00:48:51.700
nobody over here will want to invest in it.

00:48:55.536 --> 00:48:57.918
We'll manage to reach
somewhere or the other.

00:48:58.591 --> 00:49:00.257
Either in your portfolio,

00:49:01.114 --> 00:49:02.648
or your anti-portfolio.

00:49:13.553 --> 00:49:15.020
I play a lot of poker.

00:50:08.043 --> 00:50:09.603
Come on Mandal, stay ,
where are you going?

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.310
No, man I'm going home.

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:12.432
I've to go home and

00:50:12.597 --> 00:50:14.612
draft a formal resignation letter.

00:50:14.687 --> 00:50:16.380
What about all that you were faffing about?

00:50:16.533 --> 00:50:18.816
We'll be perseverant, go to the island.

00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:20.822
Now that we're asking you to stay, you don't want to.

00:50:20.864 --> 00:50:23.577
No man, such emotional attachment is unhealthy.

00:50:27.904 --> 00:50:29.376
Sit down you dumbfuck.

00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:32.213
We're calling you dumbfuck. Come back.

00:50:32.238 --> 00:50:33.883
If I'm a dumbfuck, why
are you calling me?

00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:36.444
Fuckface, you're a dumbfuck,
but you're my dumbfuck.

00:50:36.489 --> 00:50:37.489
Get it?

00:50:37.569 --> 00:50:38.569
Now come back.

00:50:38.608 --> 00:50:39.741
I'm not going to.

00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:43.138
Hey, now that you've given a good
presentation don't act like a hero. Okay?

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.367
Whatever I said yesterday
was out of anger.

00:50:46.487 --> 00:50:47.303
Come on now, come back

00:50:47.476 --> 00:50:48.736
What is this 'come back, come back'?

00:50:48.816 --> 00:50:50.283
I'm not going to come.

00:50:50.778 --> 00:50:52.378
Yesterday I overreacted man.

00:50:53.431 --> 00:50:54.842
I'm saying it now, don't you get it.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.160
Get what?

00:50:56.698 --> 00:50:58.764
I'm saying sorry, you asshole.

00:51:00.032 --> 00:51:01.028
Now come back.

00:51:01.205 --> 00:51:04.671
Should I give you two across
the face and say sorry?

00:51:55.586 --> 00:51:58.385
Let's take 8-10 pitchers
and take a bath with beer.

00:51:58.411 --> 00:51:59.376
The foam comes out well too.

00:51:59.465 --> 00:52:00.933
We've got a 10 percent
advance of the seed funding.

00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:03.126
Don't do something crazy
before the paperwork is done.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.025
Crazy?

00:52:04.105 --> 00:52:05.908
What about the crazy shit
you did at the hostel?

00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:08.944
After all, it's fun to fight man.

00:52:09.055 --> 00:52:11.988
I was half mad because
you broke the phone.

00:52:12.781 --> 00:52:14.942
Give me your phone. Let me
ask Soumya where she's reached.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.428
So Naveen, I was thinking,

00:52:16.517 --> 00:52:18.785
our new office should be near Powai lake.

00:52:19.012 --> 00:52:21.576
Research says that if you
see water every morning,

00:52:21.821 --> 00:52:24.297
yourblood cells increase by 12 percent.

00:52:25.465 --> 00:52:27.863
Motherfucker, we'll get a 1bhk in Ghatkopar.

00:52:28.004 --> 00:52:30.517
We need a UiOS person,
he needs a developer,

00:52:30.672 --> 00:52:31.775
We need to setup the office.

00:52:31.806 --> 00:52:32.940
I need an intern.

00:52:33.006 --> 00:52:35.712
Our CEO, Mr.Bansal, he'll
get us everything.

00:52:39.217 --> 00:52:40.750
Noone gets everything.

00:52:42.014 --> 00:52:44.837
There are somethings that
are not in your control.

00:52:45.337 --> 00:52:47.003
What happened to you man?

00:52:49.576 --> 00:52:50.873
Nothing man. I was saying it generally.

00:52:51.842 --> 00:52:53.042
You guys have fun.

00:52:53.425 --> 00:52:55.758
I'll just make a call and be back.

00:53:02.517 --> 00:53:03.162
How are you?

00:53:03.193 --> 00:53:04.017
How are you bro?

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:05.221
Good. How about you?

00:53:05.283 --> 00:53:06.828
You must be in your final year?

00:53:06.895 --> 00:53:08.628
No, I graduated last year.

00:53:08.697 --> 00:53:10.164
Now I have a job here.

00:53:10.238 --> 00:53:11.521
Good stuff man. You've grown up.

00:53:11.614 --> 00:53:14.042
You're the one doing good stuff man.

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:16.991
I just liked your facebook status.

00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:18.161
Oh, you know?

00:53:19.795 --> 00:53:20.995
You killed it bro!

00:53:23.832 --> 00:53:25.899
I'm feeling extremely jealous.

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:28.502
You have such a great life man.

00:53:29.078 --> 00:53:32.278
We're the losers filling
excel sheets in office.

00:53:32.419 --> 00:53:34.486
I have a life only on weekends.

00:53:36.428 --> 00:53:39.745
By the way, even I was thinking
of an idea for a startup with PJ.

00:53:39.769 --> 00:53:41.503
But I don't get much time.

00:53:43.497 --> 00:53:44.877
Even if I found time,

00:53:44.918 --> 00:53:47.051
everybody isn't lucky like you.

00:53:53.413 --> 00:53:54.613
Tell me something.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.540
What are you?
