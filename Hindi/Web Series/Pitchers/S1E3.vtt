WEBVTT

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:14.477
Your idea is very good.

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:15.691
I am going to U.S

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.271
As soon as I am back from U.S

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.207
We will start the investment process

00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:20.518
Great!...

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.370
 ok

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:22.139
That's..

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:22.576
wow..

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.600
So, zeeshan!

00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:24.631
When do you return?

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.236
I am back in november 2016

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.983
November 2016..?

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:30.546
Yeah.. got some work

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.998
But you guys don't worry

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.205
A soon as I am back, we'll complete
the funding and start the work

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:36.555
and mark my words

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:38.269
By quarter 3, 2030!

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.126
You will be number 1 in your verticle

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:41.785
2030?

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.062
Yes.. 2030!

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.986
You have to understand and
get into the mind of the VC

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.780
they are all very rich guys

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.217
you have to suit up a little bit,

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:21.694
You have to look a little  professional

00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:23.607
Boss! I think all that is bullshit!

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:27.416
Next time wear a t-shirt
and slippers to meeting

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.805
Keep your feet on the table and tell him

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:32.353
write a cheque, or else I
am leaving moth*rf**ker

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:35.884
Confidence is the key!

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.568
So, once we acquire enough users,
we plan to raise a second round

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:41.592
We might even go mobile only.
Just like Flat-Chat!

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.501
So, What do you think?

00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:48.233
Gaurav!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.249
Haan!

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:50.384
yes. One sec

00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:53.233
Guys, you all are from 2011 batch. Right?

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:54.289
yes!

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.280
Do you guys know Shaina Oberoi?

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:58.629
Shaina Oberoi?

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.375
Do you guys have her number?

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:02.995
No?

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:05.463
How much funding do you need?

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.682
You have set it up well
in two and a half years.

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:23.564
Investors were very excited about the
idea of delivering Indian food to homes

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.334
and its very affordable

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.410
The meal that you are
eating now costs Rs. 435

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:31.445
Cool.
Rs.435 for 3 plates.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.167
Its Rs.435!

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.940
I have Rs.400

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:05.182
Be confident, place your foot on the table

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:06.333
I'll give you the funding.

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:07.642
like Now!

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.801
Be professional

00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:10.513
Show me some Confidence!

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:11.849
What are you thinking?

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:12.190
Yes!

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.182
That's more like it.
Boss!

00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:14.198
What are you doing?

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:15.698
You will not get my money and

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:18.357
I will make sure no body
funds you in Hiranandaani.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.484
You don't keep your foot up.

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:21.118
He will. How will he not?

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.876
I lived in the silicon valley for 17 years

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:39.625
I have invested in like 5 companies there

00:03:40.043 --> 00:03:41.043
But India,

00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:44.991
The fragrance of soil has dragged
me to this country.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:47.553
You know, I want do something Indian

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.061
we will make India's Uber

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.188
We call it "Induber".

00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:55.238
You getting what Iam saying!

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.329
you see..

00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:58.926
Why don't you have any
females in your team?

00:03:59.474 --> 00:04:02.074
You think woman are not on par with men

00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:04.144
I started Zorpolo from scratch

00:04:04.157 --> 00:04:07.442
and today, it's worth 50 f**king million

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:10.266
Why don't you have any female co-founders?

00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:18.317
Come on join me..
come on.. what's wrong?

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.069
come on.. come on..

00:05:08.714 --> 00:05:12.914
Getting a funding is equal to
fighting the battle of Mahabharatha

00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:17.445
Pandavas were 5 of them, though.

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:24.147
Now to win this war, what do you guys need?

00:05:24.172 --> 00:05:25.100
Passion,

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:25.854
Commitment

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:26.862
and Dedication

00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:27.945
It was retorical

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:31.290
Ask what is needed?

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.899
What is needed Sir?

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:41.589
We need Shree Krishna!

00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:48.904
Tell me, who is Arjun among you guys?

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:50.929
Arjun?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.360
should be Jeetu?
I can be Yudistir.

00:05:53.392 --> 00:05:55.258
No Iam Yudistir, I never lie

00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:57.534
You are Bheem?
No.. Dibs on Bheem.

00:05:57.543 --> 00:05:58.543
You are Sehdev

00:05:58.558 --> 00:05:59.558
You are Bheem?

00:05:59.574 --> 00:06:00.774
Naveen.. ya Naveen

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.733
Ya..I think it's me.
Iam Arjun.

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:05.891
Hello Arjun

00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:06.606
Ah..

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.812
In 1972,

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:14.924
my gradfather started a small bhujiya
shop on the streets of Bikaner

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:16.202
a small shop

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:18.107
and today

00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:27.342
Weather its breakfast with
tea or snacks with beer,

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.947
it's only our brand, that people use

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:33.870
It's been 25 years, we are
leading  the market

00:06:34.948 --> 00:06:39.741
also we were on the cover page of
last month's Fortune magazine.

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:42.373
Despite of all this,

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.949
Do you know what people
call us behind our back?

00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:49.771
What do they say?

00:06:51.528 --> 00:06:52.528
Bhujiyawaala!

00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:57.901
So that's why you want to
expand to different sectors?

00:06:57.926 --> 00:07:00.401
You are catching on..

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:02.631
I am putting my money on new ventures

00:07:02.647 --> 00:07:04.647
Your product is very exciting,

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:07.329
Perfect for our diversification.

00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:09.503
I want to invest in you guys

00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:12.417
That's great Gary,

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.630
we actually wanted to dilute
15 to 20% of our equity

00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:17.671
for around 1.2 to 1.6

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.412
You guys decide the number,

00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:23.919
I' ll decide the equity

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:29.774
I want atleast 51%

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:34.872
But sir 51% practically makes
you the owner of the company

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:35.888
Company?

00:07:37.142 --> 00:07:38.824
You mean.. four of you?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920
haan?

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:44.918
If one falls sick, you won't be
having a proper teams to play carrom

00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:46.173
Company!

00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:48.900
Amount that you're asking
for in the market,

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:51.345
multiplied by 4

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.420
plus my brand,

00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:55.087
My contacts,

00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:56.511
Plus new office space

00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:59.214
Its not a bad deal at all

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.737
Sir can we negotiate
somewhere around 30-35%

00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:04.428
I am not selling vegetables, you As*h*le

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.635
Ah! Gary, but this is a
very difficult decision

00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:12.230
we will think over it and let you know

00:08:12.287 --> 00:08:13.420
like 51% is a lot

00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:19.322
Shree Kriskna had asked Arjun, the
blood of his own family members

00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:22.969
I am just asking for a little more stake

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:24.875
nothing much.

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:30.572
Will talk about it on Sunday

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:32.875
Parth.

00:08:34.994 --> 00:08:35.994
Parth?

00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:37.315
Naveen.

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:40.834
Parth!

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.662
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry... Sorry.

00:10:11.687 --> 00:10:12.805
No no.. Please.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.830
Go on..

00:10:13.855 --> 00:10:14.926
I don't want to hold you back.

00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:16.607
No.. I was thinking about Gary's proposal..

00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:18.060
Naveen!

00:10:18.092 --> 00:10:21.449
Do you realise we,
meet like once a week now.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.464
You'll be busy when I come to your place

00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:25.669
Can't you talk to me for 5 minutes properly?

00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:26.717
I'm sorry. sorry!

00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:30.121
Don't you think you have been
saying sorry too often these days?

00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:31.169
Iam sor....

00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:33.899
Yeah maybe I am screwing
up a lot these days

00:10:34.003 --> 00:10:34.899
I am really sorry

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:40.033
Naveen, Its not gonna work like this.

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:44.172
We need to talk..

00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:55.685
I am sorry..
I am sorry..

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.487
Aww Baby..
You got scared?

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:00.479
Arey. It's not funny.

00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:01.614
Yogi was saying,

00:11:01.638 --> 00:11:03.905
Ashish brokeup the same way

00:11:04.057 --> 00:11:05.501
He got busy with the startup,

00:11:05.526 --> 00:11:06.668
he couldn't give time to his girlfriend

00:11:06.692 --> 00:11:07.692
What nonsense!

00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:08.724
such a cliche.

00:11:09.437 --> 00:11:11.437
But cliches exists for a reason

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:13.476
Let us do some clihe?

00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:15.191
Let's go to Goa.

00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:16.564
What about your Bangalore trip?

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.580
I'll skip it

00:11:17.605 --> 00:11:20.468
and moreover we dont even know when
we get time after this weekend.

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:22.222
Don't be foolish and

00:11:22.707 --> 00:11:24.198
ignore the job.

00:11:24.381 --> 00:11:27.305
Your job stays with you for the
next 30 years, even if I don't

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:28.663
just go to Bangalore

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:31.964
Lets go to Goa!

00:11:32.655 --> 00:11:33.940
It's just a small project, anyway

00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:35.162
Arey, its your work ya

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:37.131
Don't cheat your work!

00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:39.266
Will go to Goa someother time.

00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:42.186
Ok. What defines you better?

00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:44.837
Business Consultant at Mckenzie
or Naveen Bansal's girlfirend?

00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:46.429
Tell me.

00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:50.334
Ok fine.

00:11:50.374 --> 00:11:51.863
 I will go to Bangalore

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.506
Happy?

00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:55.554
Very unromantic as*hole

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.609
What un-romantic as*hole

00:11:57.645 --> 00:11:59.579
We can have fun here as well.

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:01.572
wanna drink something?

00:12:02.018 --> 00:12:05.885
Ya.. One hazelnut cappucino and
one Chicken tikka sandwich

00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:08.804
One tea and two idlis please.

00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:09.836
and dessert?

00:12:10.074 --> 00:12:12.341
and what cigerrates do you have?

00:12:12.995 --> 00:12:13.995
Goldflake. Sir

00:12:18.928 --> 00:12:21.287
I have drawn the second
FD too on wednesday.

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.562
Yogi is looking for loan

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.710
and don't know how much
to depend on Mandal!

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.216
and about Gary's proposal,

00:12:33.007 --> 00:12:34.420
at times feel it's a necessity

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.153
and some times I feel its greed!

00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:39.480
But you don't have to
necessarily settle for Gary

00:12:39.642 --> 00:12:41.181
Tomorrow, you have an event

00:12:41.229 --> 00:12:43.563
won't there be potential investors?

00:12:44.356 --> 00:12:45.756
there will be.. But..

00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:47.472
may be for one last time.

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.266
We are running out of time, Shreya

00:12:52.293 --> 00:12:56.419
If none of the investors show any
interest in our tommorow's presentation

00:12:56.816 --> 00:12:58.750
we might have to go with Gary

00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:02.499
Did you try your Jury room approach?

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:03.531
No.. not yet.

00:13:06.633 --> 00:13:08.720
What do your 3 stooges say?

00:13:09.426 --> 00:13:10.426
Nothing as yet

00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:15.641
They are banking on me to
take the right decision.

00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:18.508
That's getting me more scared

00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:31.240
I could hug you right now

00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:34.652
and say that you will be great

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.754
you will make the right decision

00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:40.811
or

00:13:41.335 --> 00:13:43.801
I could be less dramatic and tell you

00:13:48.042 --> 00:13:50.042
I believe in you Naveen Bansal

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:56.979
Just like the 3 boys
waiting for you at home.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.765
Oh Shit!

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.654
What happened?

00:14:07.742 --> 00:14:10.257
wait.. wait.. can I get a parcel..?
6 idli's, 2 chai...

00:14:10.313 --> 00:14:11.702
Sir. Food got over.

00:14:31.944 --> 00:14:33.079
Where is he still?

00:14:33.104 --> 00:14:35.563
He said he will return in 15
minutes, its been 2 hours now.

00:14:35.603 --> 00:14:36.626
asked me to wait just for a tea.

00:14:36.651 --> 00:14:38.396
I need to go home and sleep

00:14:38.428 --> 00:14:39.695
Yogi, call him now.

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:40.714
He left his phone here,

00:14:40.793 --> 00:14:42.277
we would have made tea here itself

00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:45.769
If this as*hole wouldn't have used
all the milk to set the curd

00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:47.698
Tomorrow is an important day

00:14:47.873 --> 00:14:50.158
How do we get lucky if
we don't eat curd and sugar?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.229
Shut up! You piece of crap

00:14:54.276 --> 00:14:55.149
As*hole

00:14:55.173 --> 00:14:57.774
For the last 6 hours you are only
changing the font of Thank You.

00:14:57.806 --> 00:15:00.941
Aey.. Aey.. Its very important to
make a lasting impression. Ok!

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.580
Atleast I am not roaming around
the city since morning

00:15:07.604 --> 00:15:09.977
I had been to print visiting
cards, you motherf*ckr

00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:14.334
What do you do when you meet
investors and they ask for contacts?

00:15:14.358 --> 00:15:15.732
Guys, what's happening here?

00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:17.510
Naveen, this is harrasement at work place,

00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:18.430
I can't work like this.

00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:19.271
I can't tolerate this.

00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:20.113
What you can't tolerate?

00:15:20.138 --> 00:15:23.183
You 'll take my laptop to the room and
jerk off watching Wolf of Wallstreet

00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:25.047
No, I was preparing for the pitch.

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.624
I''ll kill you ba*t**d

00:15:27.664 --> 00:15:30.084
You know what I saw on touchpad?

00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:31.624
Yogi, what are you saying man?

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:34.464
We had to use sanitizer,
Jeetu tell him.

00:15:34.497 --> 00:15:36.481
Stop it.. Stop it Yogi.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.258
Yogi, Behave your age.

00:15:39.791 --> 00:15:41.727
You are bullying us since 10th standard.

00:15:41.847 --> 00:15:42.847
Stop it now.

00:15:44.466 --> 00:15:47.418
Madal, he's right. there's was
something on the touchpad that day!

00:15:47.442 --> 00:15:49.140
Jeetu! You are doubting me?

00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:51.039
I swear, it was just curd.

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:54.172
Jeetu relax,

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.172
we have an event tomorrow,
don't be stressed.

00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:58.616
You be quiet.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.434
Do you even know what stress is?

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:02.147
Soumya is asking for
watermelon from past 3 days

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.640
and I am not able to do it because

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.497
 from past 2 days I am
getting a compilation error

00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:07.981
I am lying here since 2 days and
I am exhausted doing this

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:10.314
I thought of having a good sleep today
to be ready for tomorrow's event

00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:13.625
But now you ruined it by
coming two hours late

00:16:13.837 --> 00:16:15.386
Now, the market at Borivali opens at 6am,

00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:16.593
I have to buy it from there.

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:20.529
Soumya will also ask
me to get fresh fish also,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.083
So I need to carry watermelon in
one hand and fish in the other

00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:25.154
and travel in local train from Borivilli,

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:26.711
because my bike is punctured and

00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:30.944
no time to repair it because I
am lying here since the last two days

00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:33.723
Stress it seems.

00:16:54.406 --> 00:16:55.406
Hold this!

00:16:55.763 --> 00:16:57.030
Is breakfast ready?

00:16:57.144 --> 00:16:58.277
Set it up quickly, please!

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.260
Did you read my message?

00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:02.795
I don't have time now

00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:04.493
I am already runing late by half an hour

00:17:04.518 --> 00:17:06.096
I have to get fresh and leave.

00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:08.454
Where are you going on Sunday morning, son?

00:17:18.053 --> 00:17:19.053
Dad!

00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:24.462
Arey No.. my nephew was saying,

00:17:24.526 --> 00:17:27.636
Vishwanathan Anand doesn't
like fried idli at all

00:17:27.653 --> 00:17:27.954
What?

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:28.986
Ya seriously

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:04.444
Too much crowd..

00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:08.698
These 24-25 years kids try to start the
company as soon as they get out of college.

00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:11.475
Half of them might not even know
the spelling of entreprenuer

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.528
All virgin as*es!

00:18:12.832 --> 00:18:14.237
That qeue looks smaller.

00:18:21.526 --> 00:18:23.793
Is this the line for Registration?

00:18:24.827 --> 00:18:25.406
No!

00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:28.175
We are standing to pick up the ration

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.510
hahaha

00:18:32.913 --> 00:18:33.818
As*hole

00:18:36.193 --> 00:18:37.740
Do you know him?

00:18:37.938 --> 00:18:38.740
whom?

00:18:38.796 --> 00:18:41.962
That guy. Wanna be Zukerburg, Amit Awasti.

00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:44.533
completed his B-Tech from NIT Hamirpur

00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:46.938
but wears Harward T-shit to show-off

00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:49.794
He is the founder of Litigator

00:18:50.144 --> 00:18:51.144
Litigator?

00:18:51.319 --> 00:18:52.834
Its the social network for Lawyers.

00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:57.409
They had issues with co-founder
regarding equity last March

00:18:57.497 --> 00:19:01.875
They used his own app to
file a lawsuit against him

00:19:04.322 --> 00:19:05.722
Do you recognise him?

00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:07.298
who? John Snow?

00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:09.603
who Snow?

00:19:09.707 --> 00:19:11.240
That guy in black suit?

00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:13.341
Oh..the guy in black suit?

00:19:13.366 --> 00:19:13.754
haan.

00:19:13.818 --> 00:19:14.611
No.

00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:13.556
Ya.

00:19:13.716 --> 00:19:14.716
No.

00:19:14.796 --> 00:19:18.156
He is the founder of
milkman.com, Ritwik mukherjee.

00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:18.836
Okay.

00:19:19.476 --> 00:19:23.436
Milkman. I've heard about it.
Its like the Uber of dairy products

00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:24.876
Dairy products my ass !

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.836
Its just an online stable.

00:19:26.956 --> 00:19:29.796
In 2012, it started of with
the name dudhwala.com...

00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:33.116
but then government banned it
thinking it's a porn website.

00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:36.516
Now they have relaunched
it with a new name.

00:19:36.836 --> 00:19:39.076
By the way, I'm Saurabh Mandal.

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:40.836
This is Naveen Bansal

00:19:40.956 --> 00:19:42.076
And yogi.

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:43.276
Hello sir.

00:19:43.556 --> 00:19:45.476
Do you have a VC ?

00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:47.476
Visiting card ?

00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:49.716
Yes, I do. Freshly baked .

00:19:49.796 --> 00:19:50.676
Then give it.

00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:52.996
Actually you meet a lot
of frauds in such events.

00:19:53.116 --> 00:19:57.836
Last time some asshole clicked a
selfie saying "I am Rahul Yadav".

00:19:57.916 --> 00:20:02.836
Later I got to know that asshole was just
a B.com student from Mithibhai.

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:06.836
Give it using two hands...
With one hand is cnsidered unluncky!

00:20:08.931 --> 00:20:11.733
You should be knowing all of
this, we are of same age.

00:20:16.655 --> 00:20:17.655
Take it.

00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:18.901
ya.. like that

00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:21.083
Ravi Ram Rastogi.

00:20:21.107 --> 00:20:22.107
Hmm..

00:20:22.219 --> 00:20:24.480
CEO, CTO, CMO

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:26.368
Founder, Superentreprenuer.com

00:20:27.877 --> 00:20:29.344
This is my 8th company

00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:32.575
and about those seven before this?

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:33.965
They were shut down.

00:20:34.282 --> 00:20:34.980
Oh!

00:20:35.147 --> 00:20:37.980
But this one will take me
to the list of Fortune 500

00:20:38.004 --> 00:20:39.004
Wait and Watch!

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.004
Thing is.. Hello..

00:20:41.377 --> 00:20:42.353
So the thing is,

00:20:42.377 --> 00:20:45.311
The soul of entreprenuer
is always restless.

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:48.829
It will roaming around untill
you come up with a masterpiece.

00:20:52.147 --> 00:20:53.726
So only 3 of you guys?

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:54.369
No sir..

00:20:54.385 --> 00:20:55.321
No.. no. Its good.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:59.242
The lesser number of co-founders,
higher will be the equity value.

00:20:59.267 --> 00:21:01.361
No sir, we are four of us.
Jeetu is on his way

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.615
Yogi, call him and ask where did he reach?

00:21:03.639 --> 00:21:06.631
Oho.. that's like 8% loss.

00:21:06.663 --> 00:21:08.063
No problem, carry on!

00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:16.180
Leave it Dad.

00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:17.164
It's in the warranty,

00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:19.672
company guy will come and fix it for free.

00:21:19.704 --> 00:21:22.307
haan. You studied computer
science instead of mechanical

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.417
you might get tired to do all these stuffs

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:30.553
give me a bigger screw driver?

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:39.425
are you looking for app for it?

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620
No.. no. Its about work

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.417
Watchen was saying..

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.154
You didn't come home for 2 days.

00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:53.171
Actually Dad.

00:21:53.194 --> 00:21:56.011
the company guys are making him work a lot

00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:57.091
beacuse of the project

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.682
they call him daily, even on sundays

00:22:00.067 --> 00:22:01.067
You get fresh,

00:22:01.282 --> 00:22:02.282
get ready

00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:05.029
Dad, would you want to eat watermelon?

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:07.909
What kind of project do
you have on Sunday's?

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.068
Call your boss and tell,

00:22:09.093 --> 00:22:12.132
your dad has come from
Bikaner, so can't come today.

00:22:12.982 --> 00:22:15.188
give the phone, let me speak to him

00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:17.394
Dad, It doesn't work that way.

00:22:17.418 --> 00:22:19.085
 have just come for a day

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.688
If not for Pandyaji's daughter wedding,

00:22:20.712 --> 00:22:22.112
I wouldn't have come.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.777
Can't you have lunch
with your dad for a day

00:22:25.015 --> 00:22:27.512
your company won't shut down without you.

00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:29.361
Yu have grown up now right!

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.297
nothing like that Dad.

00:22:31.926 --> 00:22:33.139
I will just be back.

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:34.845
Hey! I am talking to you!

00:22:36.286 --> 00:22:38.009
Send TTYL to your boss

00:22:38.497 --> 00:22:38.906
Dad

00:22:39.035 --> 00:22:39.565
Watermelon

00:22:46.105 --> 00:22:46.593
Hello Yogi.

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:48.491
Yogi i can't come

00:22:48.516 --> 00:22:49.859
All of a sudden dad showed up!

00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:51.440
What nonsense?!

00:22:51.556 --> 00:22:53.623
yes! He is not allowing me to leave.

00:22:53.654 --> 00:22:54.474
Not allowing to leave?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.612
Are you a 4th grader?

00:22:56.123 --> 00:22:57.123
Arey Yogi.

00:22:59.032 --> 00:22:59.585
Jeetu?

00:23:00.428 --> 00:23:01.261
Yes dad i am coming.

00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:08.474
 I am talking something important,
and you are peeing?!

00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:10.379
Just wait Yogi.

00:23:11.027 --> 00:23:11.728
Jeetu?

00:23:12.297 --> 00:23:15.036
The seminar is about end,
post lunch is our main event.

00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:15.988
Leave quickly!

00:23:16.068 --> 00:23:17.760
Yogi I will talk to you later

00:23:18.607 --> 00:23:19.607
Jeetu?

00:23:22.977 --> 00:23:23.977
yes dad!

00:23:25.186 --> 00:23:26.186
What is this?

00:23:27.527 --> 00:23:28.823
looks like a boxer

00:23:28.863 --> 00:23:30.730
it was stuck behind the tank

00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:35.136
You don't even have time to
keep your clothes in check.

00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:37.056
and what were you doimg in the bathroom?

00:23:37.109 --> 00:23:38.309
nothing.. phone...

00:23:38.895 --> 00:23:40.429
I was peeing.

00:23:41.368 --> 00:23:42.368
you will wash your hands after that or

00:23:42.427 --> 00:23:45.294
anyone from the company will come to do it.

00:24:04.476 --> 00:24:06.756
I am sorry sir. We have to
follow certain guidelines.

00:24:06.836 --> 00:24:08.116
See, listen...

00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:09.156
Apoorva..

00:24:09.996 --> 00:24:12.036
Apoorva, our friend
is on his way.

00:24:12.156 --> 00:24:14.836
Isn't it possible to first
give us our three passes.

00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.036
Like, you can hold on
to our friend's pass.

00:24:17.116 --> 00:24:19.476
He will collect it from
you, when he is here.

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:21.476
Let me check.

00:24:26.076 --> 00:24:26.756
Naveen.

00:24:26.836 --> 00:24:27.716
Naveen.

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:29.836
Naveen..

00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:32.036
Actually I,

00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:33.876
just found out that...

00:24:34.236 --> 00:24:35.996
this is not a movie theatre...

00:24:36.156 --> 00:24:38.516
and we cannot hold
on to your passes.

00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:41.836
But we have paid the
registration fee....

00:24:41.956 --> 00:24:43.556
1,857 Rupees per head.

00:24:43.636 --> 00:24:45.596
Sir, you're holding the que,
could you please step aside.

00:24:45.676 --> 00:24:47.036
You can't do this to us...

00:24:47.076 --> 00:24:48.796
I want to speak to
the management.

00:24:49.676 --> 00:24:51.396
How can she talk
to us like this ?

00:24:52.436 --> 00:24:53.836
I'll get you fired.

00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:55.076
Mark my words.

00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:56.836
The battle has just begun.

00:24:56.956 --> 00:24:59.156
The battle of 1,857 rupees.

00:24:59.316 --> 00:25:00.396
Mangal and Pandey
wont let her be.

00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:01.516
Stop it.

00:25:01.676 --> 00:25:02.876
What rubbish !

00:25:03.116 --> 00:25:05.156
How can she talk
to us like this.

00:25:06.996 --> 00:25:08.236
Relax.

00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:09.876
Let's figure out something.

00:25:09.956 --> 00:25:11.076
Figure out what?

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.676
She has everyone's profiles.

00:25:13.836 --> 00:25:16.036
We won't get entry without jitu

00:25:16.676 --> 00:25:18.916
I told you, let's have sugar
and curd before leaving.

00:25:18.956 --> 00:25:21.316
Mandal, Please
don't start again.

00:25:25.876 --> 00:25:26.876
Dont' answer.

00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:27.956
Answer.

00:25:31.116 --> 00:25:32.116
Hi Gary..

00:25:33.476 --> 00:25:36.116
Gary, I am little busy, can
I call you after sometime ?

00:25:36.236 --> 00:25:39.596
There's still time for the
presentation to start, Parth..

00:25:39.756 --> 00:25:41.396
You're already busy ?

00:25:43.116 --> 00:25:45.276
No Gary.

00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:47.236
We just came here
to see a friend.

00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:49.916
One doesn't meet friends
in such events...

00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:53.556
You either meet your
competition or investors!

00:25:53.836 --> 00:25:56.236
Don't think of me as an idiot.

00:25:56.476 --> 00:25:57.756
And Listen..

00:25:57.916 --> 00:26:00.476
Put your phone on loudspeaker

00:26:00.676 --> 00:26:03.516
Then you won't have to
play Dumb charades.

00:26:04.236 --> 00:26:05.236
Ya.

00:26:07.636 --> 00:26:09.516
I'm not upset...

00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:12.196
If I was in your place I
would have done the same.

00:26:12.276 --> 00:26:15.076
You should get a good value
for a good product..

00:26:15.196 --> 00:26:18.716
and there is no better place then such
events to realize your product's value.

00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:22.476
Gary, It is a good
event but we're.....

00:26:22.516 --> 00:26:24.716
In a hurry ? I know..

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:27.516
You have to meet a
lot of investors...

00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:30.476
have to discuss
you're future plans

00:26:30.596 --> 00:26:32.436
I know..

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:35.636
But before that, you dont want
to listen to my new offer ?

00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:37.316
New offer ?

00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:39.556
I thought a lot..

00:26:39.716 --> 00:26:45.036
Then I realised that this deal
is little unfair for you..

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:48.796
So the amount which you
guys had proposed?

00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:53.476
Suffix a zero to the number.

00:26:57.156 --> 00:26:58.156
Gary..

00:26:58.436 --> 00:26:59.596
That's a lot of money!

00:26:59.636 --> 00:27:00.156
No.

00:27:00.436 --> 00:27:02.556
You wanted a lot of money...

00:27:02.636 --> 00:27:06.476
and I am giving you
a lot of money X 10

00:27:06.836 --> 00:27:07.556
But ofcourse...

00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:10.596
Equity will be the same... 51%.

00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:12.836
That is non-negotiable.

00:27:13.836 --> 00:27:17.036
I'm on my way to my
lonavala farmhouse...

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:18.436
For a meeting.

00:27:19.196 --> 00:27:21.916
Give me your answer
before I get there...

00:27:21.996 --> 00:27:24.316
Or the offer stands cancelled.

00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:25.196
And ya...

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.396
If you get an investor
before that then..

00:27:27.436 --> 00:27:28.596
All the best.

00:27:28.716 --> 00:27:30.676
But Gary how will
I reply so fast

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:32.556
Naveen you're beer

00:27:32.716 --> 00:27:34.036
And I am snakcs!

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:37.236
If we both get together,
we'll have a party!

00:27:37.396 --> 00:27:39.316
I'll be waiting for your call...

00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:40.116
Parth.

00:27:42.436 --> 00:27:44.516
Did he just offer us...

00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:47.316
Jitu always goes missing
in such crucial times.

00:27:47.396 --> 00:27:49.196
Mandal just text him once.
-okay.

00:27:49.956 --> 00:27:51.396
What are you thinking ?

00:27:55.836 --> 00:27:58.476
I need a jury room.

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:11.396
Smells nice!

00:28:11.636 --> 00:28:12.836
Have you added ajwaine?

00:28:12.996 --> 00:28:13.556
Yes papa.

00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:16.436
Salt water fish have a
very unique taste..

00:28:16.716 --> 00:28:18.116
They're very soft soft.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:18.836
ya.

00:28:18.996 --> 00:28:20.796
We don't get it
over at our place!

00:28:39.436 --> 00:28:40.636
I'll be back in two minutes.

00:28:40.796 --> 00:28:42.156
Where are you going
at lunch time ?

00:28:42.396 --> 00:28:45.796
Just closeby to get some milk...
Rgiht below the building!

00:28:45.876 --> 00:28:47.876
The milkman has already
come in the morning!

00:28:48.316 --> 00:28:51.996
Dad. I though I'll prepare some
'Rabdi' for you in the evening!

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:53.956
There was less milk
so I asked him to.

00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:55.196
Ya she asked me to.

00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:57.116
But why do you need to
go in this heat???

00:28:57.196 --> 00:28:58.956
I will have it next time.

00:29:00.316 --> 00:29:02.476
No Dad. It's no trouble. I insist.

00:29:02.796 --> 00:29:05.436
Saumya makes nice 'rabdi'.
I'll go get it in 2.

00:29:05.556 --> 00:29:06.836
Wait a minute Jitu.

00:29:08.836 --> 00:29:10.316
Sit over here.

00:29:19.836 --> 00:29:21.196
Beta (daughter) listen.

00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:26.516
Make me this concoction.

00:29:31.276 --> 00:29:32.836
Papa, can I make
it after lunch ?

00:29:32.956 --> 00:29:35.556
No, the doctor has asked me
to have it with lunch.

00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:42.916
And listen.

00:29:43.396 --> 00:29:45.236
Take your time and boil it for long!

00:29:45.436 --> 00:29:46.436
There's no hurry.

00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:47.556
Yes, Papa.

00:29:50.596 --> 00:29:51.716
Tell me honestly.

00:29:52.476 --> 00:29:53.676
Where were you going.

00:29:55.476 --> 00:29:56.916
Papa, to buy milk, whatelse.

00:29:56.996 --> 00:29:58.756
You were going to
smoke a ciggarette.

00:29:58.916 --> 00:30:01.116
Papa, I quit smoking in college.

00:30:01.156 --> 00:30:02.436
Don't lie.

00:30:03.116 --> 00:30:04.836
I've found a few in your office bag!

00:30:05.996 --> 00:30:06.556
Papa..

00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:08.836
How much should I lie for you ?

00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:10.596
Before marriage...

00:30:11.596 --> 00:30:15.156
Before marriage I had to lie to Parimal
that you dont drink or smoke..

00:30:15.956 --> 00:30:18.916
They married their daughter into our
family because they had trust in us.

00:30:19.156 --> 00:30:20.676
And you had promised your mom

00:30:20.756 --> 00:30:21.636
That you would quit smoking!

00:30:21.676 --> 00:30:23.076
Did you quit?

00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.276
Okay, Sorry papa.

00:30:27.676 --> 00:30:30.076
If you get desperate to smoke
than have a chewing gum .

00:30:30.236 --> 00:30:32.836
Hardiyal quit
it the same way.

00:30:33.516 --> 00:30:36.916
Okay Papa then I will go, get
some mint from downstairs!

00:30:41.476 --> 00:30:42.476
Here.

00:30:43.836 --> 00:30:45.396
Have it.

00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:09.716
If you make one more sound

00:31:09.836 --> 00:31:12.156
I will put castrol in your
mouth and make you gargle it.

00:31:12.236 --> 00:31:13.836
What are we waiting for ?

00:31:14.276 --> 00:31:16.436
We are getting soo much money now!

00:31:17.036 --> 00:31:19.756
If we take more time then
even this plan will get ruined.

00:31:20.036 --> 00:31:22.476
Naveen has the first right
to take a decision.

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.556
Let him come out
of the jury room.

00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:25.556
Then we will decide.

00:31:25.676 --> 00:31:28.156
What is this jury room ?

00:31:30.836 --> 00:31:32.916
I've been sseing it since
our college time.

00:31:33.036 --> 00:31:34.796
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

00:31:34.836 --> 00:31:36.996
He locks himself in a
room for 15 minutes.

00:31:37.276 --> 00:31:39.836
And he comes out with
the right decision.

00:31:40.996 --> 00:31:43.436
And thats why we
call it a jury room.

00:31:44.116 --> 00:31:46.836
But in such a busy event, how
did he find a empty room ?

00:31:47.556 --> 00:31:49.396
This is the height of sexism.

00:31:49.476 --> 00:31:51.996
What, were they not expecting
female entreprenuers at all ?

00:31:52.156 --> 00:31:55.236
Gents washroom is open but the
female washroom is locked!

00:31:55.396 --> 00:31:57.996
You will get a lot of
mcps in such events.

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:58.796
You know what..

00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:02.236
Even in my visiting card I
have given my brothers number.

00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:07.676
And how did you ?

00:32:08.196 --> 00:32:11.636
If one Gandhiji can convice
lacks of britishers  ...

00:32:11.916 --> 00:32:14.796
Why wouldn't a housekeeper get
convinced with two!

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:17.636
You guys are still here ?

00:32:17.756 --> 00:32:17.916
Ya.

00:32:18.076 --> 00:32:19.076
Didn't go home?

00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:20.556
Where is that CEO of your's ?

00:32:20.636 --> 00:32:22.676
Actually that's who we are waiting
for!

00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:24.156
If you're wasting time...

00:32:24.516 --> 00:32:26.036
Then follow me on twitter!

00:32:26.076 --> 00:32:26.716
Ya ya..

00:32:26.796 --> 00:32:28.476
I have 198 followers.

00:32:28.716 --> 00:32:31.596
If you both follow me, then
it'll become a double century.

00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:32.316
Shit !

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:33.796
I have only 116...

00:32:33.916 --> 00:32:35.836
But I have 312
followers on linkedIn.

00:32:35.876 --> 00:32:36.756
312 ?

00:32:36.836 --> 00:32:37.836
Shit !

00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:40.156
Just wait for my app
to get launched..

00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:43.156
Then watch how I overtake you.

00:32:44.116 --> 00:32:46.396
Why can't you go there
and do your networking ?

00:32:46.956 --> 00:32:48.916
Actually I am waiting
for my roommate..

00:32:49.156 --> 00:32:51.116
I forgot my keys.

00:32:51.516 --> 00:32:53.596
Even the other 7 are out.

00:32:54.036 --> 00:32:55.316
So he is coming to
give me the keys.

00:32:55.516 --> 00:32:57.276
You'll are 9 people
staying together?

00:32:57.356 --> 00:32:58.276
4 BHK ?

00:32:58.476 --> 00:32:59.276
No No..

00:32:59.356 --> 00:33:00.356
It's a 2 BHK

00:33:00.676 --> 00:33:01.676
But spacious enough.

00:33:01.836 --> 00:33:03.156
800 sqft.

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:04.596
Actually

00:33:04.756 --> 00:33:07.116
Since I got a divorced in 2008...

00:33:07.396 --> 00:33:09.956
I've to live in a shared apartment!

00:33:10.836 --> 00:33:12.396
It helps you build..

00:33:12.436 --> 00:33:13.436
Teamspirit.

00:33:14.156 --> 00:33:15.716
You had a divorce ?

00:33:15.956 --> 00:33:16.636
Yes.

00:33:19.636 --> 00:33:20.636
Sorry.

00:33:23.116 --> 00:33:24.396
Why you're saying sorry ?

00:33:24.556 --> 00:33:25.996
Why you're saying sorry ?

00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:27.716
When she is not saying sorry..

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:29.076
Why you're saying sorry ?

00:33:32.956 --> 00:33:33.956
It's okay.

00:33:35.236 --> 00:33:38.556
Everyone is not that lucky to
have a Sudhamurthi in their life.

00:33:38.996 --> 00:33:41.796
Once my company gets funded...

00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:44.796
Just wait and watch how
'Manglik' girls line up for me!

00:33:44.996 --> 00:33:47.716
But in so many years you
didn't get funded even once ?

00:33:47.836 --> 00:33:48.836
I did..

00:33:49.276 --> 00:33:51.036
In 2003 I did..

00:33:51.116 --> 00:33:53.476
There was an investor who
was ready to invest..

00:33:53.876 --> 00:33:56.236
But was asking for 50% equity.

00:33:56.476 --> 00:33:58.196
And our founder and CEO

00:33:58.396 --> 00:34:00.116
Was sort of a buddha type..

00:34:00.276 --> 00:34:01.276
Said no to it .

00:34:02.036 --> 00:34:04.596
Since then till
today... I swear to god

00:34:04.756 --> 00:34:11.476
The only time I have slept peacefully is
while travelling in a train's sleeper class.

00:34:11.956 --> 00:34:12.956
Ya karunesh..

00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:13.796
Yes.

00:34:13.996 --> 00:34:15.396
Come inside.

00:34:15.796 --> 00:34:16.316
What !

00:34:16.636 --> 00:34:18.156
They aren't letting you?

00:34:18.396 --> 00:34:20.716
Why do you always come in boxers???

00:34:20.956 --> 00:34:21.996
Dumbfuck!

00:34:44.996 --> 00:34:46.836
What happened ?

00:34:48.636 --> 00:34:50.196
Tell me what happened ?

00:34:52.236 --> 00:34:52.876
Yogi ?

00:34:53.036 --> 00:34:54.356
Okay, I have decided.

00:34:54.476 --> 00:34:55.236
What ?

00:34:56.796 --> 00:35:00.276
I want to tell you'll with Jeetu.
Let's go to his place .

00:36:10.116 --> 00:36:11.796
What are you doing ?

00:36:14.036 --> 00:36:16.116
Yogi'd texted me.
I am going down.

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:18.236
They are waiting for me in
the parking lot.

00:36:18.516 --> 00:36:21.596
What will I answer
dad if he gets up ?

00:36:21.716 --> 00:36:23.116
Please handle it for 2mins..

00:36:23.156 --> 00:36:23.836
Please..

00:36:24.116 --> 00:36:24.716
Please.

00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:26.836
Okay, you go...

00:36:27.116 --> 00:36:28.516
I will handle it.

00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:33.316
Third floor or fourth floor ?

00:36:33.436 --> 00:36:34.836
Terrace !

00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:37.996
Don't stand... -Hey jitu, hie..

00:36:38.076 --> 00:36:41.436
Don't stand over here, the
watchman out here is my dad's spy.

00:36:45.156 --> 00:36:48.276
Hmm, so what did you decide?
Mandal, lower the volume.

00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:51.916
So what did you decide, we are
taking money from Gary, right ?

00:36:51.956 --> 00:36:53.956
This one's not telling
us anything at all!

00:36:54.116 --> 00:36:56.076
No, we aren't taking
money from Gary.

00:36:56.836 --> 00:37:00.076
Infact I already texted
him saying "No".

00:37:04.196 --> 00:37:05.876
Naveen, what is the
logic behind this ?

00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:08.316
What logic, It's our
idea our hardwork,

00:37:08.396 --> 00:37:10.236
We are working on it
from such a long time

00:37:10.316 --> 00:37:12.476
Now randomly we would give away
half the stakes to somebody, why ?

00:37:12.516 --> 00:37:14.756
He is giving us money, that's
why, don't you get it..

00:37:14.796 --> 00:37:16.556
How it helps our compnay's valuation!

00:37:16.796 --> 00:37:20.716
I guarantee you, in one year we
will create more value than this .

00:37:20.756 --> 00:37:21.756
Naveen..

00:37:21.796 --> 00:37:22.996
Are you serious !

00:37:23.756 --> 00:37:25.516
We couldn't even go
for today's event

00:37:25.996 --> 00:37:27.916
Forget about raising funds...

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:30.476
Investors aren't calling
us for even  a second meeting.

00:37:30.516 --> 00:37:32.676
You think Sikoya and
Nexus will join hands...

00:37:32.716 --> 00:37:34.956
and beg you to take
their investments ? !

00:37:35.356 --> 00:37:37.196
We'lll have to
compromise a little, Naveen .

00:37:37.436 --> 00:37:40.036
Aren't you all realising
that thios guy is a 'Bhujiyawaala'.

00:37:40.276 --> 00:37:42.436
He doesn't even have a
technical background..

00:37:42.436 --> 00:37:43.996
How will he understand
our product ?

00:37:43.996 --> 00:37:45.476
That's the advantage.

00:37:45.716 --> 00:37:47.396
If he doesn't have any
technical knowledge,

00:37:47.436 --> 00:37:49.236
he won't interfere .
-what if he interferes ?

00:37:49.236 --> 00:37:49.836
Then we're fucked.

00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:51.676
We'll think about it later..

00:37:51.796 --> 00:37:54.476
And how can you take
such an important decision by  yourself?

00:37:54.796 --> 00:37:57.076
Just because you've C.E.O.
on your visiting card...

00:37:57.156 --> 00:37:58.596
... doesn't mean
you are the boss.

00:37:58.716 --> 00:37:59.236
Naveen

00:37:59.436 --> 00:38:00.676
We are a team..

00:38:00.996 --> 00:38:02.836
And there is no I in team.

00:38:03.076 --> 00:38:04.716
Guys it isn't that..

00:38:04.836 --> 00:38:09.276
You know, whenever I've taken a decision
in the jury room, it's always been right

00:38:10.756 --> 00:38:13.596
And what exactly do you
do in the jury room ?

00:38:14.916 --> 00:38:15.756
What ?

00:38:16.276 --> 00:38:17.636
I am asking you!

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:19.916
How do you take your
decision in the jury room?

00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:20.956
It's simple..

00:38:21.156 --> 00:38:23.356
He must be listing down
the pros and cons..

00:38:23.756 --> 00:38:26.276
Does a SWAT analysis of it and
determines the probablity.

00:38:26.436 --> 00:38:28.316
Even I have done that in the
third semester of my high school

00:38:28.396 --> 00:38:29.396
SWAT analysis ?..

00:38:29.796 --> 00:38:30.796
Probablity ?..

00:38:31.116 --> 00:38:34.396
He fucking tosses a
coin and decides.

00:38:34.836 --> 00:38:35.276
What !

00:38:35.316 --> 00:38:36.716
Tosses and decides ?

00:38:36.996 --> 00:38:38.076
Naveen look here..

00:38:38.196 --> 00:38:40.476
I had decided to marry
saumya after asking you!

00:38:41.076 --> 00:38:43.156
I didn't need to toss
a coin for that.

00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:45.236
But you needed it today?

00:38:45.596 --> 00:38:47.356
You fucking decided four
peoples carrer,ambition

00:38:47.356 --> 00:38:49.156
and their future on the
basis of tossing a coin !

00:38:49.236 --> 00:38:50.876
And what if it was the
other side of the coin ?

00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:54.036
Then right now we would have been in
Gary's farmhouse licking his ass ? !

00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:57.316
Naveen I can follow you till hell
but I can't follow a 1 Rupee coin.

00:38:57.356 --> 00:38:59.076
Naveen, everyone has
left their job...

00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:01.596
This startup was
your idea, right ?

00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:04.316
We are working 16 hrs
continously at your home.

00:39:04.636 --> 00:39:07.076
And this CEO tosses
a coin and decides.

00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:10.316
Atleast you could
have asked us once ?

00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:13.076
Was that asking for too much from you?

00:39:14.036 --> 00:39:18.636
What was it Naveen? Head or tail ?
- Guys I don't know what it was!

00:39:19.236 --> 00:39:22.596
Decision was taken on the basis of tossing
the coin, not on the result of it.

00:39:23.596 --> 00:39:25.076
What do you mean ?

00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:33.636
Like this coin even life
gives us 2 choices...

00:39:34.156 --> 00:39:37.716
No matter how many lists of pros and cons
you make both sides would always be equal

00:39:37.916 --> 00:39:40.356
And you won't be able
to pick any side.

00:39:40.636 --> 00:39:43.076
That time all you can do
is listen to your heart.

00:39:43.116 --> 00:39:47.716
That's why if you toss the coin once,
you will come to know which side won.

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:51.836
But you didn't even see if
it was a head or a tail ?

00:39:53.036 --> 00:39:55.516
I didnt see it but I heard it.

00:39:55.956 --> 00:39:57.956
When the coin stays in the
air for half a second..

00:39:58.156 --> 00:40:00.076
A voice answers from the
bottom of your heart...

00:40:00.396 --> 00:40:01.036
Which says..

00:40:01.196 --> 00:40:04.196
Please let it be
heads, please heads!

00:40:04.476 --> 00:40:07.716
That's when you realize no
matter what the result is...

00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:10.076
Your heart wants it to be heads.

00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:15.796
And I have realised that our first investment
can't be set on the basis of greed.

00:40:16.516 --> 00:40:18.716
Where gary is in greed
of equity and we..

00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:19.756
of money.

00:40:20.076 --> 00:40:22.396
Our first investment should be
only on the basis of our...

00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:24.476
Idea and skill.

00:40:28.356 --> 00:40:32.556
Just for more funding I can't let
anyone control my ambitions.

00:40:33.316 --> 00:40:36.036
I am really sorry
I could'nt do it.

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:40.636
Now you guys decide what to do.

00:42:38.156 --> 00:42:39.676
Where are we going ?

00:42:39.796 --> 00:42:40.876
Back to the event.

00:42:40.956 --> 00:42:43.156
But what if they don't let us in!

00:42:43.356 --> 00:42:45.276
The same thing what we always do ..

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.396
Try.

00:42:47.516 --> 00:42:48.196
Let's go.
