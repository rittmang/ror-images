00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:08.882
MOM! I don't want to get married!!!

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.132
I'm only 27. Not even old
enough to get married!

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:14.359
Don't "Shona beta" me!

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:17.085
Mummy... Mummy, don't lie to me, OK?

00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:18.706
You don't have any Thyroid cancer!

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:22.777
OK wait... I'm getting another call.

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.209
Yeah... Wait! Wait!

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:27.174
Yeah Aarti?

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:30.919
Actually no. I'm still in a client meeting.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.764
Where are you?

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:36.691
Oh, you've already reached?

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:38.615
Where?

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:40.513
OK. OK.

00:00:40.593 --> 00:00:42.433
You've just reached, then?

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:44.950
No, no, no...

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.667
My client meeting... can be cancelled!

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:49.189
Yeah, I'm on my way!

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:50.933
Let's go.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:54.410
We've to go around and
then come back here!

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:55.195
Come on!

00:00:58.703 --> 00:00:59.770
Come on already!

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:11.855
Hi!

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:15.372
Sorry, I got a little late.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.404
Hope I didn't keep you
waiting for long!

00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:18.768
No!

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:20.125
Nice ambience!

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:21.467
Did you order anything?

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:22.737
Akhilesh, 2 cappuccinos!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.514
No... I don't want to have anything!

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.927
No, no. Both are for me.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:28.618
I'll drink one now, and the other
one later, once it gets cold.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.071
These guys charge 100 bucks
extra for cold coffee!

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.658
By the way...

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:35.633
You look...

00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:36.832
Quite different
from your pictures!

00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:37.848
I know!

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.380
I'm not photogenic!

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:40.237
I mean...

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:41.897
I look good in real life!

00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:43.923
But my pictures, don't
come out that great!

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:47.673
You've met guys before... like this?

00:01:47.743 --> 00:01:48.205
Yes!

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:50.210
2-3 times

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:51.933
Me too!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.060
6 times!!!

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.456
You know...

00:01:54.687 --> 00:01:57.434
Since I've completed my P.G.
from IIM Indore?

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.854
 Mom's had girls lined up for me to meet!

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:01.760
I told her, "Mom...

00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:03.530
...I can't marry right now!...

00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:05.149
...I want to explore the world...

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:06.267
...Travel with friends...

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:06.967
...Scuba dive...

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.005
...Sky dive"

00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:11.310
I'm telling you... You too should
stop with this marraige shabang!

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.759
Marriage doesn't even make sense

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:15.353
Youngsters like us should have fun!

00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:18.259
It's a good thing actually, that my
mom forcefully made me a profie.

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:19.766
Or else, we wouldn't have been on this date!

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.250
Wait a minute!

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:22.131
Your mom... made your...

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:23.536
Tinder profile?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Tinder?

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:26.036
No, no. Shaadi.com

00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:27.782
You're..

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:28.711
Hi.

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:30.378
Nikita?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.535
Nikita.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.399
Nikita?

00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:34.087
Nikita.

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:35.781
Oh...

00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:37.141
Oh shit... shit!

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:39.083
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.205
I got confused!

00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:44.389
It's a good thing he showed up early!

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.269
We were about to get...

00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:47.340
WE were about to get married!

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:49.837
Saurabh Mandal!

00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:51.765
I'm a marketing head in Technity.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.423
And what do you do?

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:54.789
Today's Thursday?

00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:56.218
Yes.

00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:57.749
On Thursdays I...

00:02:57.808 --> 00:02:58.386
...do legs!

00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:01.530
Gym!!!

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:03.641
Nice... Nice

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.245
Please have a seat! Enjoy!

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:06.277
Enjoy!

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:08.768
And have fun also.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.649
Mr. Saurabh?

00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.278
Aarti?

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.916
Actually, Aarti. I wanted to clear
something first, before we start.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.233
Mr. Saurabh, I know what you want to say.

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.569
That you've had girlfriends
before this, isn't it?

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:35.622
I know.

00:03:35.638 --> 00:03:37.273
No, not really. That's not it.

00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:40.384
How did you know that I like cappuccino?

00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:43.677
Aarti, look...

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:45.812
I didn't want to come
here in the first place

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.297
It's just that my mom wanted me to be here.

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.400
You know how parents pressurize you

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.860
Your...

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:58.065
Your moustache is just like Anil Kapoor's!

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:01.777
No look, Aarti...

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:03.712
Actually, I can't go ahead
with this marriage!

00:04:03.774 --> 00:04:06.436
Mr. Saurabh, I understand your reluctance!

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.765
How much sugar?

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:09.066
One.

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.184
Just like me!

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.241
Look, if I were to
tell you the truth...

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.035
I too, had two boyfriends before this,

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.318
And I got intimate with them, as well!

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:19.788
But we didn't  do anything "dirty".

00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:21.573
That I will do...

00:04:21.614 --> 00:04:22.939
...only with my husband.

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:24.981
After all, I'm an Indian!

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.445
How can I forget my
roots and culture

00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:28.328
Aarti. No doubt, you're
a very nice girl...

00:04:28.344 --> 00:04:30.404
Panditji too, says the same

00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:32.046
No, no. Now...

00:04:32.098 --> 00:04:32.813
Now, I...

00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:34.527
Mr. Saurabh, it's a yes for me.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.114
Just...

00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:36.582
Like the last guy...

00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:38.332
Don't hide anything from me!

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:41.122
Why... What did the last one hide?

00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:43.423
My marriage with him
had been confirmed.

00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:45.503
But just a few days
before the engagement...

00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:46.503
...dad got to
know that...

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.986
...he was quitting a stable
job to begin a start-up!

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:52.002
And the marriage got
canned, then and there.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.597
That's when I saw your profile and...

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.139
So what, if he was going
to begin a start-up?

00:04:57.765 --> 00:05:00.240
Why would any girl marry
a "start-up guy"?

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.027
Now... If the company doesn't do well...

00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:04.423
Will I have to leave my household
chores and go do a job?

00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:05.764
Tell me Mr. Saurabh?

00:05:06.963 --> 00:05:08.230
Actually, Aarti...

00:05:09.138 --> 00:05:11.828
This is exactly, what I
wanted to tell you about...

00:05:11.947 --> 00:05:13.614
(TVF Pitchers Theme Song)

00:06:02.455 --> 00:06:04.122
No laundry from tomorrow!

00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.095
No maid from tomorrow!

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.225
No milk from tomorrow!

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:10.349
Even, no newspaper from tomorrow!

00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:13.717
Gym membership will be cancelled!

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:15.759
Metros will be used instead of the car!

00:06:15.788 --> 00:06:17.152
Electricity will be saved!

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:20.455
Internet speed will be
reduced from 8mbps to 1mbps!

00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:21.947
No. No. No. No dude.

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:22.978
Atleast let the net speed stay!

00:06:23.034 --> 00:06:24.558
Do you not want Jeetu, then?

00:06:24.653 --> 00:06:27.370
If we don't save enough, how
will we ensure his salary?

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:35.025
Alright then. Let's reduce the
speed from 8mbps to 4mbps.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.929
Table top-ups will be stopped!

00:06:38.944 --> 00:06:40.809
Ordering food from
restaurants will be stopped!

00:06:40.824 --> 00:06:42.507
Will be absolutely stopped!

00:06:42.562 --> 00:06:45.626
Infact, all kinds of luxury expenditures
will be absolutely stopped!

00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:46.790
What's the total?

00:06:46.848 --> 00:06:47.768
Three thousand

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:48.522
Seven hundred

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:49.554
Twenty-five.

00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:51.921
And adding my share to it...

00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:55.639
Seven thousand

00:06:55.663 --> 00:06:56.472
Four hundred

00:06:56.512 --> 00:06:57.512
Fifty.

00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:58.747
And how much is Jeetu's salary?

00:06:58.838 --> 00:06:59.584
One lac

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:00.393
Thirty seven thousand

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.107
Five hundred.

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:02.520
Superb plan!

00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:03.933
We'll save for a
year and a half...

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.084
...and shell out one month's salary!

00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:07.766
"Alright!"

00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:11.809
"Alright!"

00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:13.392
Madal, what are you doing dude?

00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:14.194
What?

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:14.915
What are you doing?

00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:15.815
Music!

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:17.131
Loud music!

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:18.471
Can't hear a thing!

00:07:18.598 --> 00:07:19.966
You carrry on!

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:22.733
"Alright!"

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:32.787
What I'm saying is...

00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:34.576
Let's add another 50 bucks to this...

00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:36.565
And hire some intern to do the coding.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.072
Yogi, an intern will replace Jeetu, now?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.676
We need people with some work
experience in our compnay!

00:07:41.684 --> 00:07:43.538
People who've worked at some senior level!

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.166
Someone who can build a
team in the future...

00:07:45.192 --> 00:07:46.303
Someone who can strategize!

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:47.387
Naveen...

00:07:47.692 --> 00:07:49.149
Did you find that t-shirt of mine?

00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:49.887
What t-shirt?

00:07:49.997 --> 00:07:51.483
The 'InfoCom' one.

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:54.213
Where I'd an experience of 4 years?

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.125
As a Senior Consultant!

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:58.328
Since I'd BUILT a team there...

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:00.229
They'd gifted that t-shirt to me.

00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:02.633
I don't know dude.
We're busy right now!

00:08:02.673 --> 00:08:03.673
Shit!

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.445
Now, I'll have to strategize
what to wear!

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.078
What do we do then?

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:11.284
Dude, I think we're getting
a little impatient here!

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:12.818
I was thinking, what if...

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.371
Jeetu manages to convince Soumya!

00:08:14.403 --> 00:08:15.284
Naveen...

00:08:15.403 --> 00:08:16.750
She's his wife!

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:18.135
She gives him sex!

00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.721
You can never convince a
woman who gives you sex!

00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:21.537
Trust me.

00:08:21.674 --> 00:08:22.949
This is all coming from experience!

00:08:22.974 --> 00:08:23.974
Look Yogi...

00:08:24.332 --> 00:08:26.094
Without Jeetu, we have no company.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:26.990
Naveen...

00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:28.189
We've no jobs.

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:30.554
We have to start a company,
with or without Jeetu.

00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:31.540
Yogi...

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.567
What are you doing?

00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:35.792
Did you think about it?

00:08:36.362 --> 00:08:38.157
I'd asked you something, yesterday?

00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:39.308
What'd you asked?

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:41.387
That thing...

00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:44.046
Can I be part of your start-up?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.325
WHAT?

00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:46.136
WHY?

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:47.707
What do you mean by "Why?"?

00:08:47.803 --> 00:08:48.940
You all are engineers!

00:08:48.993 --> 00:08:50.403
You need an MBA!

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.985
How will you'll run a company
without business expertise?

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:54.136
Mandal, I'll let you know!

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:55.368
Give me some time.

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:57.152
It's a very important
professional decision!

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.985
I'll let you know, alright?
-OK

00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.390
So will you send me a mail, or
you'll communicate verbally?

00:09:03.422 --> 00:09:05.606
Should I expect a call by Friday?

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:06.232
I'll...

00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:08.439
Why Friday? He's a sweet kid!

00:09:08.485 --> 00:09:09.938
Let's do your G.D. and P.I.
today itself!

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:10.613
And the results tomorrow.

00:09:10.644 --> 00:09:12.191
Personal interview, today?

00:09:12.263 --> 00:09:14.168
Iit's already 10.
When will I prepare...

00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:15.406
Fuck, it's 10 already?

00:09:15.446 --> 00:09:16.905
I'm going to get killed!

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.378
What if it's 10?

00:09:21.497 --> 00:09:22.862
'Jhalak' comes up only
at 10 in the night!

00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:26.465
No Yogi! I've to meet Shreya. If
I get late, she'll screw me!

00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:28.950
Haven't you told her
already, about our start-up?

00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:31.299
Where have I met her, since so many days?

00:09:32.361 --> 00:09:33.605
MANDAL!

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.893
Where's my face-wash dude?

00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.671
The 'Kurule' medical therapy one?

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:39.433
Don't use that!

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.648
I used it and 4 of my pimples combined into a boil!

00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:42.830
No dude. My face-wash!

00:09:42.866 --> 00:09:45.617
Will you get it, or should we disqualify
you before the interview round, itself?

00:09:45.681 --> 00:09:47.427
I was just about to go!

00:09:49.713 --> 00:09:50.713
Dude, look...

00:09:51.117 --> 00:09:52.014
There's this coder...

00:09:52.052 --> 00:09:52.978
He's in the third year.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.180
He's the son of the paternal
uncle of a mutual friend!

00:09:55.212 --> 00:09:56.347
He's almost family!

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:58.950
Let's get him onboard. I assure you, he'll rock!

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.030
Look, Yogi!

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.782
A comapny's all about the people in it.

00:10:02.983 --> 00:10:05.728
You think, any college guy
can replace Jeetu...

00:10:05.768 --> 00:10:08.434
If that's how randomly we want to hire
people, why don't we hire Mandal as well?

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:10.928
Sorry to disturb your important meeting!

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:13.529
But I hope you take the right decision!

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:16.384
I also love Jeetu!

00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:19.226
Though 3 years late, I've passed
by cheating from his answer sheet.

00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:20.950
We definitely want him onboard.

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:24.283
But till the time we do not ensure
his salary, we need a coder.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:25.212
I'm telling you...

00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:26.442
Let's go meet this guy...

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:28.868
And let's get the fucking thing started!

00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:29.862
OK, alright.

00:10:29.887 --> 00:10:31.141
Let me meet Shreya for now.

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:34.198
After that, let's go meet this
guy, in the afternoon. OK?

00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:36.859
How do I look?

00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:38.705
Fair!

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:41.975
OK. You make a move, I'll go
meet Shreya and then catch you!

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:42.999
Go. Go. Go. Go.

00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:54.503
Hello?

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.119
Naveen!!!
- Hey Shreya!

00:10:56.582 --> 00:10:58.352
You still haven't upgraded
your internet, have you?

00:10:58.392 --> 00:10:59.138
How are you?

00:10:59.178 --> 00:11:00.551
You've always been and
always will be a miser!

00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:01.598
Can you see me?

00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:02.860
Wait a second.

00:11:03.987 --> 00:11:04.592
I can see you now.

00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:05.233
You can see me?

00:11:05.288 --> 00:11:07.241
Oh God, what is that
shirt you're wearing?

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:08.646
Have you borrowed it
from the gardenkeeper?

00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:10.773
Actually, his and mine shirt
size is the same. So it fit me!

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:13.661
By the way, his wife wears XL.
Looks like that too, will fit you!

00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:16.122
If only you had something XL, no?

00:11:16.154 --> 00:11:17.257
Baby, I have my heart.

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:18.233
My heart is so big.

00:11:18.281 --> 00:11:20.246
OK, you should know, that I
haven't been looking for

00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:22.384
wi-fi all over Bhutan, to
listen to all these ridicules.

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:23.956
Yeah, as if I asked to go to Bhutan!

00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:26.179
Meditation is being learnt, with
Consultancy Project only as an excuse.

00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:27.545
If it's meditation that you wanted
to learn, you could've done that

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.868
just by waking up in the mornings
to watch 'Ramdev baba' on the T.V.

00:11:28.907 --> 00:11:33.074
Yeah, because I just love old, hairy men sweating at 6 in the morning!

00:11:33.105 --> 00:11:34.605
Why do you think I
sleep with you, baby?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.665
Baby, I thought you sleep
with me, because not

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.415
a lot of men, believe
in doing charity, no?

00:11:38.455 --> 00:11:40.313
Oh, you want me to start counting
down on the charity cases?

00:11:40.338 --> 00:11:42.693
Should we start listing your dating history, now?
-No, no, no, no...

00:11:42.717 --> 00:11:44.987
When is my true love, by
tearing through clouds...

00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:46.828
Landing on the grounds of
this country, we call India!

00:11:46.852 --> 00:11:47.773
Four O'clock!

00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:48.353
Sharp!

00:11:48.376 --> 00:11:49.318
You're coming to
get me, right?

00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:52.067
Ok, I've a meeting at 8 and I've
something very important to tell you.

00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:53.807
Oh! Even I've something
very important to tell you.

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:56.178
OK, I'll go first. Please.
Please. Let me go first!

00:11:56.209 --> 00:11:57.844
OK, go. As if I have a choice.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.733
Blurt out!

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580
Actually...

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.019
Naveen, I'm pregnant.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.810
Very nice!

00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:03.714
Who's child is it?

00:12:03.738 --> 00:12:04.500
I don't know...

00:12:04.532 --> 00:12:05.723
It could be anyone's.

00:12:05.746 --> 00:12:06.865
It could be yours.

00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:09.158
It could be Raghav's.
It could be Vaibhav's.

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:10.802
Oh, it could even be the monastery monk's.

00:12:10.842 --> 00:12:14.534
Do you have anything important to say or are
you just eating into my internet pack?

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:16.310
No. No. No. I do have
something important to say.

00:12:16.342 --> 00:12:18.324
But I'd thought, that
I'd keep it a surprise.

00:12:18.366 --> 00:12:18.985
Should I tell you?

00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:20.246
What? You bought handcuffs?

00:12:21.682 --> 00:12:23.470
Yeah, but apart from that...

00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:24.238
So!

00:12:24.302 --> 00:12:28.079
There's this guy, who's leaving his
girlfriend and moving to Brazil.

00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:30.635
This girl, decides to
start looking for a job.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:32.031
In Brazil.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.771
And, guess what?

00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:36.302
She finds herself in the final shortlist.

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:38.159
Shreya! Wait!

00:12:38.207 --> 00:12:40.215
...last telephonic interview is
left, but after that...

00:12:40.254 --> 00:12:40.715
Shreya, wait.

00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:43.085
...going to live with you in Rio, bitch!
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:44.564
Wait Shreya...

00:12:44.762 --> 00:12:47.525
This is exactly what I wanted
to give you news about.

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.988
Tell me.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.977
Uh...

00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:05.207
What are you doing...

00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:06.825
I was just about to wash them up

00:13:06.897 --> 00:13:08.943
How much will you work, after all!

00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:11.262
Anyway, the machine isn't workiing
and the maid hasn't come...

00:13:11.302 --> 00:13:12.922
It hardly takes time...

00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:14.359
I washed them...

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:16.522
What's the deal? Suddenly today...

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:18.064
It isn't really "suddenly"!

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.906
I'd cooked chicken, day before!

00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:21.746
And last night, I'd chopped the vegetables.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.810
In a household, if 2 people work
in unison, it becomes easy.

00:13:26.778 --> 00:13:29.135
These days, these machines have come up...

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:29.905
Otherwise...

00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:32.396
Our dads used to do it all, by hands.

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.131
Why don't you go...

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.089
Go do your prayers. I'll come,
make tea, once I'm done here.

00:13:39.573 --> 00:13:41.414
Do you have something, to tell me?

00:13:41.438 --> 00:13:42.367
No!

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:44.122
Why would you think so?

00:13:45.795 --> 00:13:46.795
Give me.

00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.127
Naveen... had called...

00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:55.556
Yogi and Naveen have quit their jobs...

00:13:55.597 --> 00:13:57.414
They're going to begin
their own start-up...

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:00.049
They were asking me... as well

00:14:01.303 --> 00:14:03.959
You go on downstairs. I'll get done here.

00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:06.526
So what were you saying?

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:08.423
What was I saying...

00:14:08.478 --> 00:14:09.384
No...

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:12.533
Naveen and the guys were
asking me as well...

00:14:12.565 --> 00:14:15.365
To quit my job and join them as the C.T.O.

00:14:15.859 --> 00:14:16.589
But now...

00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.851
This... When did you buy this?

00:14:19.398 --> 00:14:20.665
This is an old one!

00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:22.096
Had gotten it from my parents'.

00:14:22.208 --> 00:14:27.606
No... I was saying... These colors
suit you... They come out very well!

00:14:27.756 --> 00:14:29.248
So what did you say?

00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:32.350
I said, I'll think about it...
Now things like...

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.676
...these can't just be
decided in the moment.

00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:37.795
So I wanted to talk to
you as well, about this.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.270
Will you be benefited, in your career?

00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:42.396
If the start-up goes big,
then there's a benefit...

00:14:42.453 --> 00:14:43.833
Otherwise, it's just a risk!

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.380
Well, the work will be a lot of fun...

00:14:46.414 --> 00:14:48.058
It'll be interesting but the salary...

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:49.803
I think you should do it.

00:14:49.827 --> 00:14:50.827
What?

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:53.795
You're not doing it right...

00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:55.013
Give it to me!

00:14:56.518 --> 00:14:57.391
No...

00:14:57.843 --> 00:14:59.243
What were you saying?

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.751
I think, you should do it.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.430
No...

00:15:03.716 --> 00:15:05.798
You don't have any problem?

00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:07.795
I was trying to say, that once...

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:12.352
...I quit my job, our plan to buy
a house will be delayed.

00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:14.414
So, what's the hurry in buying a house?

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:16.362
Anyway, this is such a nice house.

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:17.883
There's such a big terrace!

00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:20.934
And then the chances of your
growth, are also so much more.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:23.210
I won't even
get an L.T.A.

00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:26.090
We'll have to drop our
Mauritius trip, as well.

00:15:26.113 --> 00:15:27.851
We'll go to Mahabaleshwar, instead.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.719
Shalini's husband owns a resort there.

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:34.802
But the salary issue will still persist.

00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:36.845
Our savings are good enough.

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:39.059
Anyway, it's been 5 months
since I've come to Mumbai.

00:15:39.137 --> 00:15:40.137
I'm thinking...

00:15:40.176 --> 00:15:42.576
...of getting a good job for myself.

00:15:46.648 --> 00:15:49.002
How do you hang these? By clips?

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.997
I thought, you wouldn't agree to this.

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:57.743
I even had my flowcharts ready,
so that I could convince you!

00:15:57.828 --> 00:15:59.418
I've only been thinking
about this, since Monday.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.325
All the effort, went waste!

00:16:01.362 --> 00:16:02.489
Don't worry.

00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:04.662
None of your effort will go waste.

00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:05.379
Anyway...

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.632
You'll have to talk to
your dad about this...

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:10.418
You wouldn't quit your job,
without asking him, would you?

00:16:12.552 --> 00:16:14.885
I was asking you to do it properly!

00:16:15.076 --> 00:16:17.695
Now I'll have to wash,
all the clothes again!

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:19.905
Even the maid's not come today!

00:16:20.536 --> 00:16:23.592
...got down all the lectures, and
uploaded youporn videos, instead.

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:26.600
Our guy's won the IBM code
competition, twice over...

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:27.672
...in a row.

00:16:28.076 --> 00:16:31.901
Legend says that he got a congratulatory
mail from Eric Schmidt, himself.

00:16:31.934 --> 00:16:34.449
But he doesn't have random
expectations, does he?

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:36.997
He knows, he won't get anything
more than the basic stipend, right?

00:16:37.021 --> 00:16:38.964
Dude, relax! He's our kid!

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.140
We'll offer him a couple of treats at
Barbeque Nation and he'll say yes!

00:16:41.172 --> 00:16:42.997
I told him, it's an Environment
Science lecture motherf**ker...

00:16:43.053 --> 00:16:46.101
If not proxy, should I
whoop your arse?

00:16:46.148 --> 00:16:48.148
Is Rohan Negi's room this way?

00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:54.070
Is he expecting you?

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.199
Yes.

00:16:56.707 --> 00:16:57.786
Follow me!

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.283
You go to hell!

00:17:19.302 --> 00:17:21.604
I don't want to see your face again!

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.571
You aren't satisfied only
with foreplay, are you?

00:17:27.627 --> 00:17:29.564
You have to have this
afterplay of melodrama!

00:17:29.595 --> 00:17:31.182
She got mad because it was strawberry.

00:17:31.214 --> 00:17:33.961
It isn't ice-cream that you'd
get almond and pistachio flavours!

00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:35.918
Does the uncle party, have matchsticks?

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:38.095
Go run to the canteen. It's time!

00:17:38.143 --> 00:17:40.010
Uncle, give him a 100 bucks.

00:17:40.096 --> 00:17:41.207
Give it.

00:17:47.731 --> 00:17:48.961
Follow me!

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.983
I can't go beyond this point.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.769
Deposit your mobiles, pendrives,
hard-disks and any other storage devices.

00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:15.770
There's a door ahead...

00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:16.842
Knock it.

00:18:17.905 --> 00:18:18.905
Twice!

00:18:19.072 --> 00:18:20.199
And then wait.

00:18:21.659 --> 00:18:22.865
Do you smoke?

00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:24.723
No.

00:18:25.473 --> 00:18:26.653
Kids!

00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:34.917
Yes?

00:18:34.957 --> 00:18:37.929
Tell chintu, that 'Yogi bhaiyaa' is
here, to give him an internship.

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:48.381
Come in.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:50.028
Sit.

00:19:12.261 --> 00:19:13.867
He's in the middle of something...

00:19:13.888 --> 00:19:15.715
Give him 75.

00:19:15.893 --> 00:19:17.237
Minutes?

00:19:17.932 --> 00:19:19.158
Headshots!

00:19:22.271 --> 00:19:26.985
Despite being the class monitor, my performance
from class 6 to class 12 steadily increased...

00:19:27.018 --> 00:19:30.401
From 72.3% to 87.8%

00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:32.003
This goes to show...

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.280
I'm responsible...

00:19:33.343 --> 00:19:34.065
...persistent...

00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:36.391
...dedicated, motivated, over...

00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:38.712
Under-rated dude!

00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:42.939
Responsible, persistent,
motivated, dedicated, under...

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:44.898
Hi Shreya!

00:19:46.058 --> 00:19:46.963
Hi Mandal!

00:19:47.026 --> 00:19:47.542
Hi...

00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:51.248
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb
your paranormal powerpoint fantasy.

00:19:51.304 --> 00:19:53.828
I'll just sneak into Naveen's room and
lock the door, so you can't come in!

00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:54.891
No. No. No.

00:19:54.907 --> 00:19:56.672
Actually, I was waiting for you!

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.913
Naveen'd told me that you're going to come.

00:19:59.494 --> 00:20:01.265
In that blazer and towel?

00:20:01.312 --> 00:20:03.146
You aren't a serial killer Mandal, are you?

00:20:03.209 --> 00:20:04.942
Only, if looks could kill!

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:09.337
Please have a seat!

00:20:09.662 --> 00:20:12.929
Actually, if I get tensed,
I need to have a bath!

00:20:14.067 --> 00:20:15.067
Better?

00:20:16.123 --> 00:20:17.583
Congratulations Mandal.

00:20:17.607 --> 00:20:19.742
You've reached a new level of creepy!

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.813
Soo...

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:22.551
Naveen's quit his job to...

00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:24.686
Yeah, I know. He's told me everything.

00:20:24.773 --> 00:20:25.934
And I too, want to...

00:20:25.948 --> 00:20:26.948
Everything!

00:20:27.734 --> 00:20:28.417
Soo...

00:20:28.464 --> 00:20:29.250
So?

00:20:31.781 --> 00:20:33.622
Shreya. We're friends, aren't we?

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.662
Facebook-wise or in real life?

00:20:37.615 --> 00:20:38.314
Joke!

00:20:39.075 --> 00:20:39.988
Do you remember?

00:20:40.083 --> 00:20:41.702
Last month, early morning...

00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.710
You wanted a Xerox of your PAN card.

00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:45.122
Naveen was sleeping.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.742
So you asked me for help.

00:20:46.837 --> 00:20:48.337
I was getting late for work...

00:20:48.377 --> 00:20:50.043
I didn't have any change on me...

00:20:50.162 --> 00:20:52.562
I still went and got the Xerox done.

00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:55.091
Look, I've this one philosophy...

00:20:55.345 --> 00:20:58.024
Friends should always help each other!

00:21:00.287 --> 00:21:01.554
No. No. No. No. No.

00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:02.843
One second.

00:21:02.899 --> 00:21:05.113
You want me to convince Naveen to hire you?

00:21:05.144 --> 00:21:05.565
No.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:05.978
Sorry.

00:21:06.018 --> 00:21:07.342
Not gonna happen.

00:21:07.383 --> 00:21:10.627
Anyway, I can't convince him.
Instead, he'll end up convincing me!

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.654
Shreya... Trust me!

00:21:12.764 --> 00:21:14.497
He can never convince you!

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:17.462
A man can never convince
a woman, who gives him...

00:21:18.256 --> 00:21:19.558
...Love!

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:20.867
And if...

00:21:21.248 --> 00:21:22.970
He doesn't budge...

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:24.248
You know...

00:21:24.287 --> 00:21:25.612
Use your methods!

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:26.990
What methods?

00:21:27.526 --> 00:21:28.542
Intercourse

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:29.962
What?

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:31.549
Mandal, have you gone nuts?

00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:33.089
Just for a 1 buck Xerox...

00:21:33.113 --> 00:21:35.192
It's actually 2 bucks. One for each side!

00:21:35.272 --> 00:21:36.804
I'm worth much more than that!

00:21:36.843 --> 00:21:37.692
OK? I'm sorry.

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:41.256
I would've helped you with anything
else, but with this, I can't! Sorry.

00:21:41.557 --> 00:21:43.357
Naveen needs my help!

00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.255
Yogi keeps winding him up against me!

00:21:49.335 --> 00:21:51.589
I really want to be a part of this!

00:21:57.661 --> 00:21:59.351
I know, I'm gonna regret this.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.808
OK.

00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:04.193
Alright.

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:08.703
Tell me one thing.

00:22:10.033 --> 00:22:10.954
When do...

00:22:10.978 --> 00:22:12.121
You call for a plumber?

00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:13.772
That wasn't me...

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:16.525
Naveen thinks that I broke
his jet spray and then...

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:18.041
No. I mean hypothetically.

00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:18.779
I mean...

00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:21.352
When would anyone, call for a plumber?

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:24.582
One calls for the plumber
when a tap's broken.

00:22:24.645 --> 00:22:27.178
Right. And what if a tap isn't broken?

00:22:27.867 --> 00:22:29.772
Then why call the plumber?

00:22:29.836 --> 00:22:30.836
Exactly!

00:22:31.248 --> 00:22:31.724
Look.

00:22:31.804 --> 00:22:33.137
In this situation...

00:22:33.153 --> 00:22:37.064
You're the plumber and Naveen's
start-up doesn't have any broken tap.

00:22:37.502 --> 00:22:40.446
Irrespective of, however great, the
work you're doing in life is...

00:22:40.574 --> 00:22:43.780
Unless, your inclusion doesn't
solve any of their problems...

00:22:43.867 --> 00:22:45.311
They don't need you!

00:22:46.724 --> 00:22:49.200
See... You need to figure
out what they need.

00:22:52.307 --> 00:22:54.174
You also need a bigger towel, dude!

00:22:54.553 --> 00:22:55.355
No. No.

00:22:55.403 --> 00:22:56.403
Don't shy away!

00:22:56.434 --> 00:22:58.101
I'm wearing my underwear!

00:22:58.514 --> 00:22:59.181
Sorry.

00:22:59.236 --> 00:23:00.530
Not wearing any!

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.950
F**K!

00:23:17.077 --> 00:23:18.204
F**K!

00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:21.085
Yogi!

00:23:21.212 --> 00:23:22.180
And...

00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:23.141
You must be Naveen.

00:23:23.173 --> 00:23:25.617
How are you 'chintu'? I saw you
at the threading ceremony, last.

00:23:25.641 --> 00:23:26.641
Not 'chintu'.

00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:28.598
Dungeon Master.

00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:32.038
There's an underscore
between Dungeon and Master.

00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:34.389
So...

00:23:34.405 --> 00:23:36.325
You guys want me to work for your company.

00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:38.905
You tell him.

00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:42.079
We were interested in
discussing the possibilities...

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:43.492
I looked into your idea.

00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:45.397
It's... quite interesting actually.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.372
Looked into?

00:23:46.428 --> 00:23:48.858
But, I haven't sent you any mail, as yet!

00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:51.333
But you'd mailed NASSCOM, hadn't you?

00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:53.532
You see...

00:23:54.103 --> 00:23:57.079
Privacy on mail is a myth my friend!

00:23:59.198 --> 00:24:00.998
So... If I join you guys...

00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:02.492
How do I benefit?

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:03.706
What do I get?

00:24:04.754 --> 00:24:05.887
Opportunity!

00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:08.745
Of course, there'll also
be a stipend initially.

00:24:08.769 --> 00:24:09.902
About... 7K.

00:24:10.008 --> 00:24:10.833
8

00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:12.523
8... 8K. Yeah.

00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:16.372
And as we grow, your monetory
compensation will obviously increase...

00:24:16.428 --> 00:24:20.266
Do you know what's the prize money for the
Internation Counter Strike competition?

00:24:21.071 --> 00:24:22.358
How much?

00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:24.587
475,000...

00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:26.015
Dollars.

00:24:28.023 --> 00:24:29.634
4... 4 times 6 is 24...

00:24:29.666 --> 00:24:30.920
And you won that?

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.039
Twice!

00:24:32.317 --> 00:24:34.769
4... 4 times 2 is 8... 8 times 6 is 48...

00:24:34.888 --> 00:24:37.555
So theoritically... I can hire you guys.

00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:39.721
But not the other way round.

00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:45.634
I want 30% equity...

00:24:45.904 --> 00:24:48.547
And... veto on product design.

00:24:50.507 --> 00:24:53.015
Dungeon_master@hotmail.com

00:24:55.111 --> 00:24:56.555
Don't forget the underscore.

00:24:58.134 --> 00:24:59.708
Mail me by Monday.

00:25:00.491 --> 00:25:02.324
Or just save it in your drafts.

00:25:02.388 --> 00:25:03.634
I'll read it.

00:25:08.524 --> 00:25:09.991
I think we need Jeetu.

00:25:10.262 --> 00:25:11.993
Do you think we need Jeetu?

00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:13.411
We need Jeetu.

00:25:13.477 --> 00:25:15.506
We'll have to first change the
passwords for all our accounts.

00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:17.516
What's up, start-up founder?

00:25:17.572 --> 00:25:19.969
Your battery looks dead
after listeninig to the deal.

00:25:20.016 --> 00:25:22.548
What's up, entrepreneur uncle?

00:25:22.612 --> 00:25:25.382
Pass on some stake to us as well!

00:25:27.798 --> 00:25:30.758
Listen up Jeetu. There's no other way out.
You have to join in.

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:33.431
I can't join in.

00:25:34.146 --> 00:25:35.465
Sorry.

00:25:36.352 --> 00:25:37.549
I told you!

00:25:38.114 --> 00:25:40.503
You can never convince a woman
who gives you sex!

00:25:40.543 --> 00:25:41.543
Noo!

00:25:42.043 --> 00:25:43.075
Suamya has agreed.

00:25:43.114 --> 00:25:44.114
SO?

00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:48.463
Ohh!

00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:51.344
What?

00:25:52.598 --> 00:25:54.099
Did you try talking to him?

00:25:54.129 --> 00:25:56.825
That's all I've been able to do since I
was 1.5 years old. TRY to talk!

00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:57.868
With whom?

00:25:58.234 --> 00:26:00.101
Haven't you watched 'Udaan'?

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.583
Ohhhh!

00:26:01.853 --> 00:26:02.853
Your dad?

00:26:02.924 --> 00:26:04.130
He's alcoholic?

00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:06.384
He's not alcoholic...

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:08.841
Why are you scared of your dad?
Are you still a kid?

00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:11.178
Naveen. Even my passbook is with him.

00:26:11.551 --> 00:26:14.495
If my salary doesn't get credited
on the 1st of the next month...

00:26:14.551 --> 00:26:16.218
My life will get debited.

00:26:17.424 --> 00:26:18.988
You guys, atleast, start.

00:26:19.003 --> 00:26:22.337
I'll see. I'll try putting in a couple
of hours of work, everyday after my job.

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:25.535
"You guys start", "I'll see". Are you mad?

00:26:25.844 --> 00:26:27.773
This way, even the Beta version
won't be ready in 6 months.

00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:29.074
There's so much to do.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:29.932
Excuse me!

00:26:29.979 --> 00:26:33.289
Aren't you the guys launching the
coolest company of Indian history?

00:26:33.439 --> 00:26:35.979
Hey! The start-up wags are here.
-Hey!

00:26:36.003 --> 00:26:37.710
The gold-diggers are here
even before the money.

00:26:37.741 --> 00:26:39.851
Listen, you need to get
a better CEO, though!

00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:43.035
Don't know about the coolest, but
could be most short-lived for sure!

00:26:43.074 --> 00:26:45.781
Don't say such bad things on
a good day like this, Jeetu.

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.071
This is for you'll.

00:26:47.122 --> 00:26:48.455
So what's up, Jeetu?

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:49.971
What are you doing here?

00:26:51.113 --> 00:26:52.153
I've come here for the interview!

00:26:52.185 --> 00:26:54.907
Mandal, that was only a joke. There's
no interview happening.

00:26:54.938 --> 00:26:55.914
I know. I know.

00:26:55.954 --> 00:26:56.954
I know jokes.

00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:59.354
I've taken improv. comedy
classes for a month.

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:00.367
Is this taken?
-Yes.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.455
OK!

00:27:02.013 --> 00:27:03.979
Don't you get it, motherf**ker?

00:27:04.065 --> 00:27:05.956
Anyway our battery's down...

00:27:06.463 --> 00:27:07.979
This is our shit, Madal!

00:27:08.002 --> 00:27:09.145
We don't need you.

00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:10.169
Trust me.

00:27:10.487 --> 00:27:11.487
You need me!

00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:13.002
Infact without me...

00:27:13.026 --> 00:27:14.082
You don't have a company!

00:27:14.145 --> 00:27:15.412
OK, go get a chair.

00:27:15.439 --> 00:27:17.289
We'll interview you right away!

00:27:17.407 --> 00:27:19.207
Just hear him out na, once.

00:27:38.944 --> 00:27:39.825
Tell me.

00:27:39.865 --> 00:27:41.024
Why should we hire you?

00:27:41.047 --> 00:27:42.514
You know, as an MBA...

00:27:42.547 --> 00:27:45.111
I've always had a clarity about my R&Rs.

00:27:45.198 --> 00:27:46.658
One of my KRA has been problem...

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.626
We don't need a marketing manager.
We need a coder...

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.979
Thanks for applying. You interview's over.

00:27:49.991 --> 00:27:51.221
No. No. No. One second.

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:52.563
I can solve your problem.

00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:54.349
I can give you something, which you need.

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:55.856
I can give you Jeetu!

00:27:59.563 --> 00:28:00.563
How?

00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:03.708
Till the time, you'll
don't get an investment...

00:28:03.771 --> 00:28:05.573
I'll pay for Jeetu's salary.

00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:08.390
A part of it through my salary
and a part through my savings.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.010
But I'll ensure that, Jeetu keeps getting
as much as he gets from his company.

00:28:12.684 --> 00:28:15.621
Mandal. Why would you
do these things for us?

00:28:15.676 --> 00:28:17.106
Not for you guys...

00:28:17.527 --> 00:28:19.055
I'll do it for myself!

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:22.620
You guys are the best
friends I've ever had.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.041
I know, apart from Naveen...

00:28:24.073 --> 00:28:26.140
We've not interacted as much...

00:28:26.668 --> 00:28:30.283
But I've always thought, that the
four of us are a very good team.

00:28:30.327 --> 00:28:33.010
You know when I'd seen
'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'

00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:34.549
I'd decided that...

00:28:34.652 --> 00:28:36.668
The four of us too, just like them...

00:28:36.771 --> 00:28:38.024
Would go on a trip.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.341
But ZNMD had only 3 guys.

00:28:45.113 --> 00:28:47.280
OK. Then... like 'Dil Chahta Hai'.

00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:49.635
Again, only 3 guys, Mandal.

00:28:51.589 --> 00:28:53.723
'Rock On' definitely had 4 guys.

00:28:54.296 --> 00:28:57.351
The 4th one, gets cancer and dies.
Only 3 remain.

00:28:57.446 --> 00:29:00.033
The point is, if I join your start-up...

00:29:00.065 --> 00:29:02.462
Then Jeetu can work full-time with us.

00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:09.284
All MBAs... are not that bad.

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:17.482
Soo...

00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:22.958
Is somebody going to say something, or are
we sitting just like this for the next hour?

00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:24.833
Don't worry, guys.

00:29:25.109 --> 00:29:26.665
It won't be that bad.

00:29:27.157 --> 00:29:29.867
Backstreet Boys... Alright!

00:29:31.752 --> 00:29:32.752
Cheers!

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:36.006
And then there were four!

00:29:37.887 --> 00:29:40.313
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:43.685
Finally, he's made himself useful!

00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:47.066
So, Jeetu's back!

00:29:47.426 --> 00:29:49.656
Important point - This news
doesn't get out of here!

00:29:49.911 --> 00:29:52.720
If dad gets to know...
- Stop going "Dad. Dad."

00:29:52.752 --> 00:29:54.934
Once we're a million dollar company,
even your dad will chill out!

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.069
And also, I've done some research and
thought of a few names for our compnay.

00:29:58.101 --> 00:30:00.426
I think, our compnay name
should have 'le' in it!

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.531
Like Google had 'gle', Apple
has 'ple', Oracle has 'cle'

00:30:03.577 --> 00:30:06.474
What non-sense are you talking? You've started
with your stupid marketing logics again!

00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:08.497
Please don't throw fries on me.
I'm the marketing manager!

00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:09.402
Oops! Sorry.

00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:10.835
Careful! Why are you throwing it on me?

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.461
So, this is your million dollar team?
