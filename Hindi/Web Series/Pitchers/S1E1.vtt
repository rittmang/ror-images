00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:38.218
Thank you, Sir.

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:38.924
Thank you, so much.

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:41.924
Sir, great job at BuyEasy...
Fantastic you are

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:42.367
Thank you.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:44.698
And sir, congratulations for your second
round investment too.

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:49.005
Actually sir, I work for an e-commerce website...

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.521
...and I am a category manager there and I...

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.093
You can upload your resume on career section on our website.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:55.232
Sir, can I show you my work sometime...
-OK, bye.

00:00:55.257 --> 00:00:56.396
Please sir... Give me one chance, sir.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.575
Guys like these, don't even let you drink at your own party.

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:03.021
 Bhati, how much did you get for 20%, 50?

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:06.292
It will be out in Sunday's Business Outlook... Take a look yourself!

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:07.786
Bhati, tell me, 60?

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.482
It's official, I can't reveal it now.

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:11.935
How much, 75?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.542
75?

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:13.880
Now don't tell me it's 100.

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:16.708
F**K!!!

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:17.583
 100?

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.134
 A hundred million?

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.994
Bhati, your company's evaluation is half a billion dollars?

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:25.384
F**K!!!

00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:26.888
So what's the big deal?

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:29.529
It's still lesser than Flipkart by 7.5 billion.

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:33.638
Bhati, it means one of my college
seniors is going to be a billionaire!

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.115
F**K, what luck!

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.404
It's not about fate or luck...

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:43.445
IIM?

00:01:43.877 --> 00:01:45.437
LSR. IIM.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.337
I should have appeared for CAT.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.342
All you do, is keep harping about my luck.

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:52.560
You've told me about your start-up
idea over a 100 times now.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.857
Why don't you do something about it?

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.408
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.034
And you are still selling these
cheap chinese phones on Mokart.

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:01.083
They're exculsive, Bhati.
-Bullshit.

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:04.240
Son, its not that easy.

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:08.177
Leave your job
and venture into the market.

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:11.631
And then you will learn, what
destinies are made of and from.

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:17.005
Dude, what the f**k?
Still on your first beer?

00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.255
Down it!

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.240
I'm good, Bhati.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:19.945
Beer for him.

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:21.732
Bhati, I have to wake up early at 8:30 for work.

00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:22.458
Shut up!!!

00:02:22.604 --> 00:02:24.122
Bhati, I've become very discipled now.

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.443
Nowadays I don't even need an alarm to wake up..

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.361
Not going to the office?

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:41.392
What are you doing here?

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:42.736
I switched on the geyser

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:43.767
The water's still heating up.

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.767
Mandal why do you take a bath in my bathroom?

00:02:45.813 --> 00:02:48.293
The handle of my bucket is broken.

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:50.810
So, take my bucket to your bathroom.

00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:53.411
Actually, I feel like taking a shower today.

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:56.775
Dude, you can take a shower even in your own bathroom.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.069
The water must've heated up!

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.782
Atleast spare my towel.

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:26.065
Mokart f**ked me over Bhati. Completely f**ked me.

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:30.260
I put in so much effort into this Brazil project.

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:33.404
Worked even on Sundays.

00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:37.310
I made atleast a 1000 PPTs.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.911
Must've made more than 5000 excel sheets.

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:46.658
And when it came down to leading the team,
 instead of me, they sent someone else to Rio.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.169
Bhati, I will take revenge!

00:03:50.194 --> 00:03:51.340
I will take revenge for sure!

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:52.775
I will even avenge them, Bhati.

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:55.639
Once I get the funding

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:58.299
I'll make so much money Bhati... So much money

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320
I'll buy Mokart and...

00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.919
 And sell it on OLX, f**king shit.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:07.222
But how, Bhati?

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:10.363
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.740
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:15.308
What are you?

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:18.862
 What do you mean, what am I?

00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:20.161
What are you?

00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:23.468
I am the Executive Regional Manager, Navin Bansal, Mokart.com

00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:25.904
No, what are YOU?

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.294
Executive regional manager...
-You are a beer.

00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:31.872
What do you mean?

00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:33.841
You're beer, motherf**ker.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:35.810
You're beer.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.646
And this bottle here? This is your company

00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:43.021
You think, you'll get into the glass.

00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:44.996
You will have fun.

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:45.865
Isn't it?

00:04:45.975 --> 00:04:46.911
But look at this.

00:04:47.617 --> 00:04:48.523
Can you see?

00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:50.475
You actually don't want to leave the bottle.

00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:54.529
For the beer to get into the glass...
It needs to leave the bottle first

00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:01.474
Once you're out of the bottle

00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:03.607
Then you can get into any glass you want.

00:05:04.228 --> 00:05:05.497
In this glass, if you want.

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.997
Or you can get into this glass

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.427
Even in this glass.
-Its a wine glass.

00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:11.966
How the hell do YOU know that?

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:13.592
You are beer.

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:15.138
Get it?

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:16.872
You can go wherever you want.

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.810
Understand?

00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:21.443
But it's quintissential you come out of the bottle, first.

00:05:22.414 --> 00:05:25.374
Once you are out, you could fill half the glass

00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:27.702
Or maybe you won't.

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.030
But if you don't come out

00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:32.710
Then you'll definitely not be able to fill it.
Look here.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.450
And its not your job to ask the questions.

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:37.693
You're beer.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.660
And your job is to flow.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.021
You are beer.

00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:43.273
This is beer.

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:44.396
Not glass.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.232
Infact there is no glass.

00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:49.558
But there is a  glass on the table, Bhati.

00:05:51.075 --> 00:05:52.075
No  glass.

00:05:57.241 --> 00:05:58.561
I am a beer, Bhati.

00:05:59.016 --> 00:05:59.904
I am beer.

00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:02.161
And I'll get out of the bottle.

00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:04.174
I will get out of the bottle...

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:13.955
Will you have  breakfast?

00:06:16.683 --> 00:06:17.384
Yes

00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.681
What do you want to eat?

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.713
Bread Omlett.

00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:23.200
We've no eggs left.

00:06:24.627 --> 00:06:25.517
Bread Jam.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.585
Which one, mixed fruit or mango?

00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:29.642
Mixed fruit.

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.495
The mixed fruit one, got done with, last week itself!

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:32.649
Mango then!

00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.339
We didn't get any mango in the first place!

00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:36.128
Just toast the bread for me.

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.229
The toaster's been broken for such a long time, now!

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.997
Dude, one cup tea will do.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.789
But I already used all the milk for the curd!

00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:43.837
So what are you eating, then?

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:44.867
Curd.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.347
I don't want any breakfast today. I'll have directly skip to lunch!

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:48.844
What?

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.710
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.459
Your 'battery' will start seeping. Your mom....
-Dude, please leave me alone.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.319
What?
-Bhati... You were right!

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.479
What?

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.574
I'm beer, Bhati.

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.621
And I will flow out of the bottle.

00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:09.637
I will resign.

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.380
I will resign.

00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:13.931
This decision will change your life.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:15.318
Come on, lets drink.

00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:17.077
One beer for him.

00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:18.982
Bhati listen, Bhati.

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:21.036
First listen to me

00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:23.260
This decision that you're taking now

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:25.435
Will change your future.

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:27.625
You know what I mean.

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.935
No!! No!! No!! You didn't get me.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.216
I will resign right now.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.927
I will call him right now.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:36.344
-Have you gone mad?
-I will resign right now, I don't give a F**K.

00:07:36.485 --> 00:07:38.656
-Listen to me.
-I will call him right now.

00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:39.711
-Listen to me.

00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:42.233
Bhati, I am beer Bhati, let me flow.

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:43.750
Bro, don't flow so much!

00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:45.934
Listen to me, just listen.

00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:47.919
You have to serve the notice period.

00:07:48.188 --> 00:07:49.308
Do you think, I'm scared?

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:50.810
Am I a coward?

00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:52.458
When did I say that...

00:07:52.483 --> 00:07:54.323
I will show it to you.
I will prove it to you.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.973
I will show it to you, right now.
-Navin. Listen, listen. This a very odd hour, right now.

00:07:58.075 --> 00:08:01.426
You think I can't get out of the bottle?
I am a beer and I will flow...

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.184
Rajat?

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.185
Rajat, I am so sorry
 that I am calling you this hour.

00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:11.028
There's something very important, I want to tell you!

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.146
Rajat you're an a**hole!!!

00:08:16.682 --> 00:08:17.962
And your department

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:20.271
Infact your whole company, is an a**hole.

00:08:20.606 --> 00:08:23.974
So you and your company are fired from my life.

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:25.614
Good night, Jai Hind.

00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:27.241
And F**K you.

00:08:27.596 --> 00:08:28.271
F**K YOU!!!

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.171
That's my drink!!!

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:36.741
Sorry...

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.656
Really? Are you from IIM?

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:43.286
Whose this?

00:09:13.726 --> 00:09:14.577
Yaa Chatty, tell me

00:09:16.877 --> 00:09:19.551
But NasCom conclave's result where supposed to be
out next week, weren't they?

00:09:20.004 --> 00:09:20.723
Akhil, who?

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:21.740
Ohh the hostel 4 guy.

00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:22.870
Is he in Nascom?

00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:24.255
OK.

00:09:24.923 --> 00:09:26.704
So..What did he say?

00:09:28.987 --> 00:09:30.229
You've got to be kidding me!

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:32.473
Are you sure?

00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:33.520
Confirmed?

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:37.232
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:38.419
F**K!!!

00:09:39.147 --> 00:09:40.286
What luck!

00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:42.482
Are you sure?

00:09:42.789 --> 00:09:44.107
Thanks, thanks, thanks dude...

00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:45.970
Ok then, I'll tell the others as well

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:48.894
No, no.. Let it get official first. I'll update my status after!

00:09:49.347 --> 00:09:50.099
OK.

00:09:50.537 --> 00:09:52.417
I'll talk to you in the evening, alright?

00:09:52.568 --> 00:09:53.433
Ok. Take care. Bye.

00:09:54.917 --> 00:09:55.482
Naveen.

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:58.222
You are so irresponsible man.

00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:00.669
This was lying behind your commode.

00:10:00.896 --> 00:10:02.005
What do I do with it?

00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:04.072
Now do one thing Mandal.

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.026
This? Throw it into the garbage!

00:10:07.209 --> 00:10:08.876
(TVF Pitchers Theme Song)

00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:35.761
He called me in the office and started yelling at me!

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.083
I said, "Sir,

00:13:37.232 --> 00:13:39.177
..if you have so much problem with me sleeping..

00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.443
..then tranfer me to HR department..

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:43.220
They even get an extra bonus for sleeping, there"

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.411
Jeetu bro!

00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:53.572
Jeetu bro!

00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:54.931
Congrats...

00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:56.213
Do you have an extra?

00:13:56.355 --> 00:13:57.080
No, it's the last one.

00:13:57.223 --> 00:13:58.536
No issue. Blow it on my face.

00:13:58.615 --> 00:13:59.513
Passive will also do!

00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:00.623
Congrats for what?

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.723
Now don't pretend!

00:14:02.895 --> 00:14:04.412
You were amazing in the appraisal!

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:05.708
By the way, did you watch last night's Nach Baliye??

00:14:05.827 --> 00:14:07.760
Chetan bhagat was awesome. He just..

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.288
How did you get to know about it?

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:11.521
Saw it last night. The 9pm show.

00:14:11.623 --> 00:14:13.388
And then again, the 11:30 repeat telecast.

00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:16.187
No, I mean about the appraisal.
How do you know about that?

00:14:16.383 --> 00:14:18.183
Appraisal ?
Ohh!!!

00:14:18.317 --> 00:14:19.708
Joshi sir showed it to us.

00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:22.260
Even the 'Acheivement box' wasn't big enough.

00:14:22.537 --> 00:14:23.982
Though I didn't really get one thing!

00:14:24.271 --> 00:14:27.674
Why did you gave yourself 4 out of 5 in the self evaluation?

00:14:27.804 --> 00:14:29.786
I knew it! I should've given myself 3.5...

00:14:29.993 --> 00:14:30.575
3.5?

00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:32.122
You should've given yourself 5 out of 5.

00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:33.607
What more could you possibly do?

00:14:33.718 --> 00:14:36.318
No tell me, what more can you do?

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.226
Jeetu, can I tell you something?

00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:39.515
Whenever we get a code written by you

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:41.381
We forward it, without even testing it

00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:43.057
Why waste time, by running it?

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:44.942
And Joshi sir keeps praising you always.

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.707
Oh, Divya from the marketing team?

00:14:46.732 --> 00:14:47.373
It's her engagement today.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:47.998
Will you come?

00:14:48.108 --> 00:14:49.075
What was Joshi sir saying?

00:14:49.158 --> 00:14:50.286
Joshi sir said, he will come!

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:52.134
Actually what happened was...

00:14:53.615 --> 00:14:56.115
No!!! No!!
I meant what was Joshi sir saying about me?

00:14:57.131 --> 00:14:58.531
You said something...

00:14:58.642 --> 00:14:59.055
Ohh

00:14:59.771 --> 00:15:01.052
Not only Joshi sir,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.738
But the whole department says this.

00:15:02.849 --> 00:15:05.626
"Whether or not someone else does...
 you are defintely getting promoted"

00:15:05.707 --> 00:15:07.119
And there's no two ways about it.

00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:08.686
OK!!! I should be going, I have work to do.

00:15:09.043 --> 00:15:09.725
Take a chewing gum.

00:15:09.863 --> 00:15:11.082
-No!!! No!!
-Its mint flavoured.

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:12.115
No, no.. You can have it.

00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:15.139
Ok!!! I will also leave after a couple of hours,
I have to rest.

00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:16.601
Too much work to do...

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:19.763
And remember the <i>mithaee kachori</i>  for tommorow!

00:15:19.873 --> 00:15:21.806
 And greetings to your wife.

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.203
Dude, did you see that guy?

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.007
Amazing

00:15:24.063 --> 00:15:25.053
Just a second...
Pass me the cigarette

00:16:20.552 --> 00:16:23.849
Sir, the staff has requested the lunch time to be
extended from 15 minutes to half an hour.

00:16:23.944 --> 00:16:24.583
Denied

00:16:24.646 --> 00:16:26.404
Let them stay hungry and stay foolish.
Next.

00:16:26.522 --> 00:16:28.893
The laptops that were given to
the TechSupport team are faulty.

00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:30.342
The batteries drain out in half an hour!

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.137
Give them 10 of these and get them energized

00:16:33.303 --> 00:16:35.500
Sir, but they need to charge their laptops.
not phones.

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:39.716
Well then tell the f**king tech support to help tech support,
in all the matters of tech support. Next.

00:16:39.802 --> 00:16:41.352
Sir, marketing research report.

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:43.939
Don't give numbers, give me graphs and pie charts.

00:16:43.998 --> 00:16:44.622
You!!

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:46.575
Give me the graphs on this by tommorow.

00:16:47.401 --> 00:16:48.927
But I am from Legal.

00:16:58.097 --> 00:17:00.097
Objection Overruled.

00:17:01.631 --> 00:17:02.391
Next.

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.667
Sir, all the new sales interns are waiting for their induction

00:17:05.013 --> 00:17:06.357
Assemble them in conference room.

00:17:06.507 --> 00:17:08.762
But sir, the AC in that room is not working.
It's very hot in there.

00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:11.074
Good, it's the first day they need to feel the heat.

00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:13.320
Sir, but what about your hair loss appointment?

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.037
Let's give a big round of applause for <i>chacha</i>.

00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:32.272
So, you guys are the company's future sales team.

00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:35.083
And you guys will be dealing with the client directly.

00:17:35.351 --> 00:17:37.044
-Are you guys excited?
-Yes sir.

00:17:38.927 --> 00:17:39.397
OK!!!

00:17:40.138 --> 00:17:42.007
So guys, let me tell you.

00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:45.008
Impressing your client is like impressing a girl,

00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:47.372
that every man in the town is after.

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:50.872
And this girl, doesn't even want to meet you.

00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:53.169
Doesn't want to pick up your calls.

00:17:53.254 --> 00:17:55.016
Infact, she doesn't even know you.

00:17:55.353 --> 00:17:57.055
She f**king hates you.

00:17:58.061 --> 00:18:00.241
Now, what will you do to impress such a girl?

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.908
Sir, I will threaten to slit my wrists, sir.

00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:07.173
Yeah, maybe, as a last resort to meet the targets.

00:18:08.518 --> 00:18:09.775
But, what will you begin with?

00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:12.299
You will never give up!!!

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:14.120
You will never quit!!!

00:18:14.899 --> 00:18:17.633
You have to treat your client, like your girlfriend.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.758
 Show them your loyalty.

00:18:18.849 --> 00:18:20.091
 Take them out for coffee.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.177
Call them thrice a day.

00:18:21.287 --> 00:18:22.372
Remember their birthdays.

00:18:22.397 --> 00:18:25.203
 In fact, fantasize about your client every night.

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:28.023
I do sir. EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.

00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:32.209
OK!!! Excellent.

00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:33.607
Anyways..

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:35.585
Guys remember.

00:18:35.654 --> 00:18:36.854
Whatever happens..

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:38.990
Whatever the situation may be.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.146
Just like me...

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:41.521
You should never quit.

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:44.954
Can I hear that aloud? You should...
-never quit.

00:18:45.085 --> 00:18:46.565
You should...
-never quit.

00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:48.395
You should...
-never quit.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.980
You should...
-never quit

00:18:50.082 --> 00:18:51.802
You should...
-never quit

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.407
You should...
-never quit

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.632
You should...
-never quit

00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:55.689
Guys!!!

00:18:57.308 --> 00:18:58.308
I quit!!!

00:19:12.327 --> 00:19:13.327
You should...

00:19:18.714 --> 00:19:19.550
But the news is confirmed, isn't it?

00:19:19.661 --> 00:19:22.781
Yaa, Akhil works at NasCom itself.
He was in hostel 4

00:19:23.176 --> 00:19:25.816
Hostel 4 guys are very nice. Very helpful.

00:19:25.977 --> 00:19:27.823
Last year, when I slapped Ruchi's father

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:30.208
Hostel 4's G.sec bailed me out.

00:19:31.502 --> 00:19:32.636
No, no. I bought it already.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.890
I've bought babycorn as well.

00:19:34.182 --> 00:19:35.182
Hey Jitu.

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:36.349
yaa, yaa...

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.928
No, I still didn't get any gooseberry.

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:40.992
Yaa, I will look for them...

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:44.559
I'll be home in an hour. OK?

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:45.230
OK!!!   OK!!!

00:19:45.922 --> 00:19:46.922
OK!!!   OK!!!

00:19:49.085 --> 00:19:51.331
Dude, vegetables are SO expensive!!!

00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:53.700
Do you know how much babycorn costs?

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:55.781
100 gram for 100 Rupees. 1000 per KG.

00:19:56.888 --> 00:20:00.513
We need money in life, dude! What do people keep going
on about, real estate being expensive in Bombay?

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:04.490
Jitu I quit the job.
-Don't eat the apple dude. They put a sticker of 30 on it but sell it for 50...

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.771
What did you leave?
What are you saying?

00:20:05.796 --> 00:20:07.279
I quit my job, last night.

00:20:09.587 --> 00:20:10.318
Why?

00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:11.841
-And Brazil?

00:20:11.904 --> 00:20:13.376
-They are sending someone else.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.044
What now?

00:20:16.217 --> 00:20:17.484
New job? What?

00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:20.460
No dude, our idea is going to
get selected in the conclave.

00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:22.219
Now let's just begin with the start-up

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:24.529
We've only been talking about it since 3rd year.
-Naveen we've already discussed this.

00:20:24.718 --> 00:20:25.493
What did we discuss?

00:20:26.197 --> 00:20:27.814
That by the time you come
back from Brazil, after a

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:29.455
year and a half, Yogi will
make some contacts here.

00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:32.172
But that we can do...
-And even I have to settle down with Somya.

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:35.037
Guys try to understand, I can't leave my job right now.

00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:37.119
There's finally something good happening for me in the company

00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:38.507
People are realizing my potential.

00:20:38.518 --> 00:20:40.301
 I’m a valuable employee to the company.

00:20:41.553 --> 00:20:43.470
Won't be able to leave the job.
- Listen to me.

00:20:43.854 --> 00:20:46.174
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here!

00:20:46.404 --> 00:20:48.424
And you're still writing codes on Python.

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:52.812
This the the opportunity.
This is the time. We should start now.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:54.594
And don't worry at all dude.

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:59.093
Once we get the funding,
we'll ensure, you get your salary even if we work for free.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.166
Jitu, all the core work is tech related.

00:21:01.248 --> 00:21:03.181
How will we manage without you?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.721
All he's trying to say is, if we want to be the 'stud' enterpreneurs,

00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:09.427
and want our company to be as big as Apple...

00:21:09.492 --> 00:21:10.865
 Then he needs to be Steve Jobs

00:21:10.935 --> 00:21:12.286
You need to be Steve Wozniak

00:21:12.334 --> 00:21:13.719
and I need to be a Sean Parker.

00:21:13.993 --> 00:21:15.705
Sean Parker's from Facebook.

00:21:16.043 --> 00:21:17.957
Yaa, we'll leave our jobs and become entrepreneurs.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.785
Can you even spell entrepreneurship?

00:21:19.915 --> 00:21:20.515
E

00:21:20.587 --> 00:21:21.307
N

00:21:21.411 --> 00:21:22.036
T

00:21:23.926 --> 00:21:27.928
To be an entrepreneur, you don't need the spelling but the spirit.

00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:31.397
Naveen, its now that finally something good's happening in my life!

00:21:31.397 --> 00:21:32.424
I've got an appraisal with such difficulty!

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.625
I got scored 5 out of 5 in my evaluation!

00:21:34.676 --> 00:21:39.036
Thats what I am saying, 5 is the limit of your job.
What after then?  You won't score anything above 5.

00:21:39.411 --> 00:21:41.609
Do you want to get through life, only scoring 5 out of 5?

00:21:43.856 --> 00:21:45.645
Listen, I will explain it to you...

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.323
What are you?

00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:52.211
What are you?

00:21:52.836 --> 00:21:55.349
What am I?
I am Jitu, married and what else?

00:21:55.418 --> 00:21:57.142
No!!No!!1
What ARE you?

00:21:57.554 --> 00:21:58.314
What are you?

00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:00.980
Are you out of your mind , Naveen?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.098
You're Coffee.

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:05.904
-What?

00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:08.204
You're coffee, Motherf**ker.

00:22:08.904 --> 00:22:09.943
You are coffee...

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:12.191
And this cup is your company.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.138
Now you think you'lll have fun getting into the glass...

00:22:15.287 --> 00:22:17.044
But you don't want to leave the cup.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:21.039
Now if you want to flow into the glass,
you have to get out of the cup first.

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:22.377
Easy. Easy.

00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:24.185
What do you want to say exactly?

00:22:24.953 --> 00:22:28.527
All I'm saying is, once you're out,
you can go into this glass...

00:22:29.738 --> 00:22:31.465
You can get into this glass.

00:22:31.619 --> 00:22:32.619
Or this...

00:22:33.574 --> 00:22:35.312
Now you might think, "This is a sugar bowl,

00:22:35.448 --> 00:22:37.120
but I am coffee. How can I get inside this?"

00:22:37.464 --> 00:22:38.505
Won't you?

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.025
But how do YOU know?
You're coffee...

00:22:42.144 --> 00:22:43.726
Dude, what are doing?

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:45.777
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry...

00:22:45.951 --> 00:22:48.341
What are you doing dude?
My phone...

00:22:49.972 --> 00:22:51.729
It happened so well, with a beer!

00:22:55.976 --> 00:22:56.988
So, what I was trying to say is...

00:22:57.071 --> 00:22:58.579
Whatever you want to say,
tell it to someone else

00:22:58.637 --> 00:22:59.668
You've left your job and let go

00:22:59.918 --> 00:23:01.540
What do you think, you're Steve Jobs?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.726
What I was trying to say is...
-First, figure it out for yourself, what you want to do...

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.449
We'll then sit and talk it down

00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:07.711
But where are you going?

00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:09.683
To buy gooseberry!

00:23:15.347 --> 00:23:16.947
I understood...

00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:19.350
Yeah.

00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.138
The f**ker called me the other day and said,

00:23:35.224 --> 00:23:36.856
"Why do keep joking about the H.R. team?

00:23:36.919 --> 00:23:39.669
Do you know how much talent it takes, to be an H.R. manager?"

00:23:39.763 --> 00:23:40.673
I said, "Sir,

00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:42.154
To sleep for 22 hours a day...

00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:43.552
definitely takes a lot of talent!"

00:23:45.622 --> 00:23:46.552
Your fly's open!

00:23:46.577 --> 00:23:47.958
He took the bait!

00:23:54.813 --> 00:23:55.813
Jeetu bro!

00:23:56.376 --> 00:23:57.376
Jeetu bro!

00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:00.821
Congratulations! Congratulations!

00:24:01.555 --> 00:24:04.740
I was so glad, I took a selfie with a printout.

00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:05.873
Kudos!

00:24:05.912 --> 00:24:06.271
So...

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.864
Mr. Jitendra Maheshwari!

00:24:09.202 --> 00:24:10.269
Mr. Senior Developer!

00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:11.674
Won't you offer me a cigarette?

00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:13.004
But this one's almost done...

00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:14.514
Just give me whatever's left of it.

00:24:18.322 --> 00:24:20.018
Tomorrow onwards, I won't be able to even see you!

00:24:20.354 --> 00:24:20.984
A big position!

00:24:21.048 --> 00:24:22.507
A big salary! The works!

00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:24.416
Did you tell your wife about it?

00:24:24.537 --> 00:24:25.889
Not yet. I'll tell her once I get home!

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.506
Ahaan!

00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:28.732
Someone's gonna get lucky tonight!!!

00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:30.482
Jeetu bro...

00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:31.506
Can I tell you something?

00:24:31.528 --> 00:24:32.419
Amazing job!

00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:34.375
Your life's now absolutely set!

00:24:34.685 --> 00:24:36.070
Within the next 5 years, you'll be

00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:36.804
Principal Developer

00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:37.874
Then within the next 10 years

00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:38.538
Associate Divsion Head

00:24:38.701 --> 00:24:42.008
And 15 years down, I'm sure, you'd have replaced Joshi Sir!

00:24:43.192 --> 00:24:43.995
Joshi Sir!!!

00:24:45.147 --> 00:24:46.819
I was just praising you!

00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:47.941
No, genuinely!

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:50.880
Joshi Sir.

00:25:01.317 --> 00:25:02.411
Will you have a chewing gum?

00:25:04.442 --> 00:25:05.442
 Chewing gum?

00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:07.179
No. I've to go back.
I've work to do.

00:25:07.327 --> 00:25:09.926
I brought the 'Advance mint' flavoured ones,
especially for you.

00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:12.991
Mint or advance mint. I just told you, I don't want any!

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:14.639
I'll take a leave. I've work to do!

00:25:14.809 --> 00:25:17.595
Alright then. Anyway, new work starts today for you!

00:25:17.677 --> 00:25:20.477
Let's meet at Pandeji's stall in the evening for some <i>mithaee kachori</i>.

00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:20.996
6 PM!

00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:22.677
Ok!!! I'll let you know...

00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:25.036
Don't think about it! It's final, OK?

00:25:25.676 --> 00:25:26.168
What's up?

00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:50.207
I just got back, these PR guys really suck the life out of you!

00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:51.708
Rajat, can I come in?

00:26:53.998 --> 00:26:55.740
How would I know, it'll take till 7?

00:26:56.373 --> 00:26:57.003
Rajesh!

00:26:58.584 --> 00:27:01.184
OK.. I'll... I'll be there, I'll be there.
Just give me a couple of minutes.

00:27:01.256 --> 00:27:01.988
OK?

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.226
Bye.

00:27:10.224 --> 00:27:11.224
So, Naveen.

00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:13.810
How many drink did you have that night?

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:17.263
I am really sorry, Rajat.

00:27:17.318 --> 00:27:19.581
I'm... I'm really embarassed about it.

00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:20.949
For whatever happened.

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:25.388
After Brazil project, I was really upset,
so I got drunk and I...

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:28.715
But anyway I think leaving the job was the right decision.

00:27:28.949 --> 00:27:31.378
But I sincererly apologize for the things that I said.

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.824
Obviously I didn't mean any of that.

00:27:32.957 --> 00:27:34.629
It's OK!!! It happens...

00:27:34.911 --> 00:27:37.341
We've been working together for three years now. It's OK!!!

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.250
Don't stress more. Chill

00:27:39.333 --> 00:27:40.007
Thank you.

00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:41.552
I brought my resignation.

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:42.344
I just thought...

00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:43.684
Officialy, I would...

00:27:45.328 --> 00:27:46.565
What next, then?

00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:48.187
Just that. Want to do a start-up, Rajat.

00:27:48.349 --> 00:27:51.535
Our B-Plan is in the final round of the NasCom Conclave

00:27:51.685 --> 00:27:54.841
Infact, there's a 99% chance, that it's going to... get selected

00:27:54.971 --> 00:27:56.224
 So I am just keeping my fingers crossed.

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.255
Wow! Full time start-up, then!

00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:58.951
Wow

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.208
Then you may have thought about the...

00:28:02.322 --> 00:28:04.851
The liquidity preferences of the Angel Investors.

00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:05.601
Yeah?

00:28:05.924 --> 00:28:08.447
You must've also thought about the ESOP pool allocation?

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.131
Right?

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:12.324
No. Not exactly!!!

00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:15.061
But I am sure with time we will get into it.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.180
You know Rahul Sharma was my batchmate in college.

00:28:19.395 --> 00:28:20.274
 Rahul Sharma!!!

00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:22.449
The co-founder of Micromax.

00:28:22.527 --> 00:28:24.688
Ohh, of course! I've read a lot, about him. Really?

00:28:24.755 --> 00:28:27.310
Of course! Of course!
You're the entrepreneur.

00:28:28.638 --> 00:28:30.740
He'd started exactly like this... With a start-up

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.199
Look where he is today!

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.155
Last year his company was valued at...

00:28:34.298 --> 00:28:35.322
...more then a billion dollars.

00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:36.431
Billion dollars, I know, I know.

00:28:37.535 --> 00:28:39.145
Have you heard about Harshit Kothari?

00:28:39.513 --> 00:28:41.180
He too, was my batchmate.

00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:43.271
Harshit?

00:28:43.858 --> 00:28:44.322
No?

00:28:44.343 --> 00:28:44.865
No...

00:28:45.164 --> 00:28:49.065
Anyway, even he began with the start-up like this

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:51.046
What was it's name again...

00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:52.147
Anyway!

00:28:53.059 --> 00:28:56.411
Unfortunately...
It was a good idea, but it didn't do so well.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.793
He had to return...

00:28:57.958 --> 00:28:59.921
To his job, in a couple of years.

00:29:00.937 --> 00:29:02.530
There were many more, in my batch...

00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:05.347
Manoj Agarwal...
His brother, Vishal Agarwal

00:29:05.565 --> 00:29:07.557
Saurabh Vahi, R.K. Paee...

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:08.910
Krishnamurthy

00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:11.591
Have you heard about them all?

00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.312
Saurabh Vahi...

00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:16.822
I don't think so.

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:19.205
Of course. You're in the big league now!

00:29:19.308 --> 00:29:21.879
You're going to win a prestigious competition!

00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:24.482
Is this competition held every year?

00:29:24.706 --> 00:29:27.181
Yeah, it's been happening for the last 7-8 years now.

00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:29.419
Wow! 7-8 years!

00:29:30.013 --> 00:29:33.668
So how many of the previous winners have made it big?

00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:36.418
Previous winners!!!

00:29:39.065 --> 00:29:42.127
I don't know actually.

00:29:43.529 --> 00:29:47.391
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

00:29:47.607 --> 00:29:51.330
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

00:29:52.404 --> 00:29:53.193
MBA

00:29:53.843 --> 00:29:54.685
IAS

00:29:55.788 --> 00:29:57.152
or Start-Up.

00:29:58.482 --> 00:30:00.039
Go out and take a look, Naveen.

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:03.381
There are start-up founders sitting in 2 out of 3 cabins, out there.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.064
Naveen...

00:30:06.398 --> 00:30:09.356
Do you really think your idea is one in a million?

00:30:12.404 --> 00:30:12.967
Look!

00:30:13.193 --> 00:30:14.810
You think this is your passion...

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.022
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:19.424
But, this is not your passion, Naveen.

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.315
If this was your passion, then you would've left this job...

00:30:22.412 --> 00:30:23.217
A long time back.

00:30:23.342 --> 00:30:27.218
You wouldn't have waited for being rejected from the Brazil project.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.334
No...

00:30:28.638 --> 00:30:29.844
No...I don't

00:30:31.304 --> 00:30:32.304
I think....

00:30:37.166 --> 00:30:38.166
Beijing.

00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:42.554
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

00:30:42.588 --> 00:30:44.520
Apointment within a week.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.338
We need someone smart over there...

00:30:46.408 --> 00:30:47.185
Like you.

00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:51.997
You have to leave for your... Visa appointment, in Delhi in...

00:30:52.287 --> 00:30:54.073
The next 20 mins.

00:30:59.012 --> 00:31:00.755
That night when you called me.

00:31:00.888 --> 00:31:01.918
You did not make a choice.

00:31:02.075 --> 00:31:04.808
You were simply reacting to a rejection.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.162
Now is the real choice.

00:31:10.137 --> 00:31:11.919
Think about it, Naveen.

00:31:12.575 --> 00:31:16.371
One in hand is obviously better than
one not-so-sure in the bush.

00:31:16.388 --> 00:31:17.127
No?

00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:52.041
Yes, Naveen.

00:31:53.773 --> 00:31:55.325
In my bathroom.

00:31:55.452 --> 00:31:58.098
How will I use your bathroom, after you've asked me not to?

00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:01.657
Yeah, tell me?

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.852
How strange is this?

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.384
Naveen didn't get promoted, so he quit his job.

00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:15.317
And now you're thinking of quitting, after you've been promoted.

00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:17.062
Human brain is a mystery, bud.

00:32:17.241 --> 00:32:18.435
-You wanna order something?

00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:20.062
What do you want to order?

00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:22.208
Let's do chilly babycorn.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.973
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

00:32:24.373 --> 00:32:26.542
People planning to quit their job, don't eat babycorn!

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.466
Dude, I was told there's going to be an influx of money, ok?

00:32:28.498 --> 00:32:30.670
I'm going to get a salary and hence, I'm ordering babycorn!

00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:33.044
-Let's order something for Naveen too.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.138
Yeah, he must be on his way.

00:32:34.483 --> 00:32:36.227
Naveen's not going to be able to make it.

00:32:36.303 --> 00:32:37.288
-Mandal?

00:32:37.552 --> 00:32:39.430
Where is he?

00:32:39.654 --> 00:32:40.927
Actually...

00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:46.543
He's the one who requested me to come here.

00:32:47.185 --> 00:32:47.977
He...

00:32:48.227 --> 00:32:49.773
... had to leave urgently.

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:52.397
But where?

00:32:52.843 --> 00:32:54.532
Airport please.

00:33:02.863 --> 00:33:05.208
It was a very tough decision for him.

00:33:05.324 --> 00:33:06.739
He was very sad.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.536
He waas even crying.

00:33:07.615 --> 00:33:09.249
Are you serious? He was crying?

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:12.157
I mean, you can't really tell on the phone, can you?

00:33:12.215 --> 00:33:13.324
But his voice...

00:33:13.442 --> 00:33:14.872
... sounded heavy.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.123
But why didn't he call us?

00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:20.154
He was in a hurry. So called up his best friend.

00:33:20.873 --> 00:33:23.162
He must be feeling really bad about facing you guys.

00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:25.528
He must be feeling very guilty.

00:33:26.966 --> 00:33:28.271
Could you please drive a little faster?

00:33:28.286 --> 00:33:30.050
Or else, I'm going to miss my flight!

00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:32.544
Sir, you see how there's so much traffic here!

00:33:32.672 --> 00:33:34.368
There's this one other way via <i>Chandivali</i>

00:33:34.688 --> 00:33:35.438
Should we try that?

00:33:35.602 --> 00:33:37.240
Will it get us to the airport on time?

00:33:37.325 --> 00:33:38.719
There won't be any traffic there?

00:33:39.006 --> 00:33:41.349
We can find that out, only once, we take that road.

00:33:41.489 --> 00:33:43.092
But if we stay stuck here, in this traffic...

00:33:43.123 --> 00:33:45.091
Then you'll definitely miss your flight!

00:33:51.489 --> 00:33:53.575
Alright then, let's try that one, then.

00:34:47.144 --> 00:34:48.245
He's not answering his phone.

00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.442
He won't.

00:34:49.765 --> 00:34:51.483
He must've even checked in, by now.

00:34:51.732 --> 00:34:54.525
You can talk to him, when he gets back from Delhi, day after.

00:34:55.497 --> 00:34:56.857
Come on, cheer up guys!

00:34:57.342 --> 00:34:58.911
Trust me. He loves you.

00:34:59.029 --> 00:35:01.391
He always spoke to me about the two of you.

00:35:03.286 --> 00:35:05.491
Excuse me! Our pitcher?

00:35:06.122 --> 00:35:07.562
Drink guys!

00:35:35.772 --> 00:35:38.454
Yogi, you've quit your job.
Isn't that going to be a problem now?

00:35:38.523 --> 00:35:39.902
I'll go back tommorow.

00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:41.982
I'll tell them, I went through some hormonal problem!

00:35:42.053 --> 00:35:43.518
I have done this before.

00:35:43.857 --> 00:35:45.895
What about your phone?
It got spilled on, with coffee, didn't it?

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.699
Forget the phone. He burned my leg.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:49.143
It's become all red!

00:35:49.466 --> 00:35:51.568
Have to keep applying burnol, without
letting Soumya know about it!

00:35:51.615 --> 00:35:53.677
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

00:35:54.075 --> 00:35:55.762
It won't burn, even if it spills.

00:35:55.923 --> 00:35:57.372
You're back!!!

00:35:57.607 --> 00:35:59.074
I knew it, you'd come!

00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:02.137
This motherf**ker's been talking as if you've died!

00:36:02.419 --> 00:36:03.629
You missed your flight?

00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:05.220
Didn't miss it. Left it!

00:36:05.786 --> 00:36:07.504
Why? Aren't there any bars at the airport?

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:09.294
You think I let go off Beijing for beer?

00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:10.583
I came back for the start-up.

00:36:10.716 --> 00:36:12.182
Don't worry. Sit down.

00:36:12.684 --> 00:36:14.128
Waiter, one more glass please.

00:36:14.195 --> 00:36:16.086
What'd happened Naveen?

00:36:16.843 --> 00:36:20.013
Rajat asked me if I was sure, that our idea is "one in a million"?

00:36:20.227 --> 00:36:21.913
It's just that, I wasn't sure.

00:36:22.107 --> 00:36:23.682
So you're sure, now?

00:36:26.567 --> 00:36:28.115
No, not sure even now.

00:36:28.864 --> 00:36:33.023
But then I thought, if we quit our jobs and try,
we might succeed, or we might not.

00:36:33.372 --> 00:36:36.254
But if we don't try, then we'll definitely not succeed.

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:41.241
So basically, the moral of the story is...

00:36:41.474 --> 00:36:42.433
We're all beers, motherf**kers!

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:44.430
OK, time to safeguard your phones!

00:36:45.443 --> 00:36:46.887
Lets bottoms up first.

00:36:46.953 --> 00:36:48.214
But I don't have a glass, Yogi!

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.762
-Take this one.
-And what about you?

00:36:49.796 --> 00:36:51.463
I'll drink from the pitcher!

00:36:52.328 --> 00:36:53.806
Cheers! Cheers!

00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:00.161
Give me a second guys.

00:37:00.866 --> 00:37:03.139
- So you're quitting your job tomorow?

00:37:03.294 --> 00:37:04.036
Yes Chatty, tell me?

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:07.114
Not really tomorrow, becasue I still
have to discuss it with Soumya!

00:37:07.428 --> 00:37:09.222
Why would you get married, dude?

00:37:09.388 --> 00:37:12.063
It's not cumpolsory, to get arrange married, for sex?

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.220
Yogi, it's not really for sex

00:37:14.467 --> 00:37:16.393
Soumya's also a very good person!

00:37:23.381 --> 00:37:24.348
What happened?

00:37:25.271 --> 00:37:26.646
Chatty just called.

00:37:27.154 --> 00:37:29.055
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

00:37:29.808 --> 00:37:31.848
Our name's not on the winner's list!

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.288
I knew it!

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.971
Hostel 4 guys are the biggest douchebags!!!

00:37:36.649 --> 00:37:38.375
Motherf**kers ate bread savouries all night long

00:37:38.399 --> 00:37:39.828
And then added their bills to my canteen account!

00:37:41.618 --> 00:37:42.587
I hate hostel 4 guys.

00:37:42.602 --> 00:37:43.422
But wait...

00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:48.381
What about my salary now?
