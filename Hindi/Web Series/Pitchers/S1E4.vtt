00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.089
Dad!

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.430
I have already made a coffee for you,

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:19.509
I will heat it up.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:21.067
No. Its ok. Please sit.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.192
Dear, Jeetu was around

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:30.082
I dozed off for half an
hour and he dissapeared.

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.949
Did he inform you?

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.034
No Dad.

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.264
But he must be somewhere around near by,

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.320
will be back in sometime.

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:37.376
Really?

00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:41.963
By the way, what time does he
come back from the office?

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.947
He will be back by around 7pm-7:30pm.

00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:47.812
Watchmen was saying, he ll come
around 2-3 am in the morning.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.579
At times he end up coming next morning.

00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:51.606
Sometimes Dad.

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:54.256
But he always calls me up to
inform that he will be late.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:55.367
Really?

00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:56.826
He will call and inform you.

00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.768
Do you get to know through
phone that is in the office?

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:04.593
cos we can call from
anywhere through moblie.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.097
Dad,I didn't get you.

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:10.982
Dear,

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:15.101
I found a number from a website
and called to his office today.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.769
They said, yesterday and
today was a holiday.

00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:22.943
So do you know, where
he was from past two days?

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:28.311
uhmm.. No Dad.

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:29.872
Dear..

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.261
uh..

00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:34.840
Among you guys...

00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:41.211
Is everything alright?

00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:42.348
umm..

00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:45.641
Yes Dad. But what happened?

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.399
No nothing happened..

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:49.908
Now that he is 26 years old..

00:01:50.404 --> 00:01:52.833
No idea, what kind of people he is with

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.381
Do one thing,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.555
Keep an eye on him.

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:02.842
Keep checking his mobile and his
credit card bills once in a while.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:06.589
Check his clothes, if there
are any lipstick marks on it.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.898
and ya put some onions and corriender
leaves in the gravy and mix it.

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.850
and heat it for 5 more mins

00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:15.310
Jeetu's mother also does the same thing.

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:16.652
Yes.

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:18.207
Where were you?

00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:20.262
Went to jogg.

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.469
for sometime.

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:25.279
With these slippers.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:30.056
I run very slow, not too fast.

00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:31.683
Practise running properly

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:35.008
Ok, now give me your phone. I
need to speak to Rinku aunty.

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.350
umm.. Shall I call and
speak to Rinku aunty?

00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:42.516
Its been a long time, haven't spoken to her

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.286
Yes, yes, Correct.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.072
 you talk to her

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:47.418
From Jeetu;s phone,

00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:51.024
you call and talk to her
and tell me what happend.

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:53.972
I will be outside reading newspaper.

00:02:58.485 --> 00:02:59.770
I can't handle this.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.077
What happened, what was he saying?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.320
He thinks you have another affair.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.977
He asked me to check your phone.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.627
This watchmen is getting on my nerves,

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:10.052
I will get him fired in this meeting

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:13.429
Naveen is going through  another tension

00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:15.786
Will have the clear idea only
by evening om what to do next?

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.582
Do you really go to meet Naveen only?

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:25.286
Sownya, are you mad?

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:27.239
I am not able to handle this, you
think i can have another affair..?

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:28.397
Then just tell him..

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.977
you have quit the job and doing startup.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:31.953
Not now.

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:33.656
Then when will you tell?

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:38.183
He will find it out
in some or the other way.

00:03:38.263 --> 00:03:40.699
office, watchmen or anyone for that matter

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:43.604
Its better that you tell him before
he gets to know from someone.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.856
Guys, I am not joking, i always got a
good numbers for the papers when my mom

00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:53.952
wished me with the kiss
near my purple chakra.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.087
If you guys kiss me here, our
luck will surely change.

00:03:58.158 --> 00:04:01.091
Mandal, please let us
find the judges first.

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.609
Yogi i feel, we will focus only
on convincing Narayanmurthy

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:13.679
He will get convinced for sure.

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:16.290
I am not sure about our
entry and permissions, but

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:19.030
I will surely get Apoorva fired.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.974
Hey Yogi..

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.839
Naveen!

00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:22.522
Hey.. Anitesh!

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.157
Our favourite Ms secretory.

00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:25.331
How are you?

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:29.267
How are you guys?

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.307
Had lunch?

00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:31.348
No.. not yet.

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:34.387
There is a garda mutton, its so tasty
that i already ate 6 bowls of it.

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:36.284
you guys too get in the que,
you won't get it otherwise.

00:04:36.324 --> 00:04:37.791
But, what are you doing here?

00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:39.641
Are you starting up something?

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.482
Hold this for a minute.

00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:43.319
carefull about the pastry.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:48.700
On sunday,our cook will be on
leave, so I had to do start-up.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.633
What?

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:50.790
What do you mean?

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:54.069
Every sunday there will be one or the
other e-summits or events scheduled

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:57.918
I just register myself and have
tasty chicken for the food.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:59.995
I will give them a hint too..

00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:01.205
Pet Pooja.om

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:03.017
yet no one gets to know...

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:09.465
By the way, what are you
guys planning to start up?

00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:14.069
We will going on the in couple of hous,
most likely. You'll surely get to know.

00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:16.624
What's so secretive about it?
Let us know now only.

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:18.839
Look, we are...

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.713
Won't the excitment die, if I
let you know everything now?

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:24.594
I know you from the college days, Naveen.

00:05:24.864 --> 00:05:27.158
No one takes a dramatic
pause as good as you do.

00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:29.070
Ok.. its fine. Don't tell.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:29.800
Nothing like that

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:31.658
Where is Jeetu? He is
not been seen around?

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.769
Because of that ass, we are facing a
problem with entry and permissions.

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:35.174
Is it?

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:35.705
ya

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:37.586
We are going to talk to
a judge regarding this.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.015
Have you seen Narayanmurthy
anywhere around?

00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:42.650
He cancelled coming here at the last moment

00:05:42.706 --> 00:05:45.650
They found a replacement
for him at the last moment

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:49.062
Heard that he is a good, very experienced

00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:50.753
Where did I see him last?

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:54.934
There he is..

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.394
Just opposite to raitha
counterin a black suit.

00:05:57.434 --> 00:05:58.501
His name is.....

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.418
Yes.. Rajath Khanna..

00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:05.972
Mumbai Head for Mokart

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.432
Should I kiss you here or in bathroom?

00:07:12.554 --> 00:07:13.498
Errr..!

00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.268
Its been two hours now, no body is
bothering to unlock this thing.

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:19.411
even after having a record
participation of girls this

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:21.864
year. We have 5 female
entreprenuers registered

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:25.022
I'll tell you there has to be a
limit to gender descrimination.

00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:26.062
I mean its everywhere..

00:07:26.126 --> 00:07:28.260
Iin business, in sports and in films..

00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:30.181
Do you know about the bectel test?

00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:30.824
No..

00:07:30.864 --> 00:07:32.664
Come.. I'll tell you. Come.

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:44.326
Why don't you talk to him once?

00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:46.866
I have rejected his project on
his face and doing a startup,

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:48.706
There is no chance in hell.

00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:54.232
Roger that..

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:55.565
See you in two.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.366
Everything is set,

00:07:57.398 --> 00:07:59.684
We will have our passes with
us in another 15 minutes.

00:07:59.724 --> 00:08:00.199
What?

00:08:00.263 --> 00:08:01.001
How?

00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:04.001
I just spent some time on
mankind's most fcreative chair

00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.771
and I made good use of it.

00:08:05.835 --> 00:08:08.152
I have 3 amazing plans to
enter this competiton.

00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:10.334
Yogi. no violence, no kidnapping

00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:13.009
I have one amazing plan
to enter the competition.

00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:15.580
Listen to me, it's full proof.
Here is the plan.

00:08:19.105 --> 00:08:22.176
You guys think you have heard
all the masterplans before, right?

00:08:22.414 --> 00:08:23.541
But not mine.

00:08:24.343 --> 00:08:25.943
Some plans are effective.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.570
Some plans are brilliant.

00:08:28.162 --> 00:08:29.429
Mine is full-proof.

00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:33.548
Exactly after 5 minutes,

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:36.034
Apoorva gets a call from the reception

00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:38.184
she goes out to attend the call.

00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:45.112
Mandal very cleverly covers the
CCTV camera's with Baloons.

00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:46.953
and then my turn

00:08:47.112 --> 00:08:49.390
What really..?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.223
Guys Sachin is here.

00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:55.968
Not "Sachin Tendulkar'',

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.534
"Sachin Bansal" is here

00:09:02.262 --> 00:09:04.622
Finally all Naveen has
to do is replace Jeetu's

00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:07.153
face on our company's profile
with somebody else's

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.714
and that guy will be
ourfake Jeetu for a day.

00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:11.982
No.. no..no..no

00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:14.745
Who's photo do we have to replace Jeetu's?

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.808
Don't we need a fake Jeetu with us?

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:18.475
Plan is full-proof Naveen.

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:19.974
We have the fourth guy

00:09:20.118 --> 00:09:22.052
I just hired our first intern

00:09:23.722 --> 00:09:24.150
Oh

00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:25.198
and he is here

00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:27.955
Keys are under the doormat

00:09:43.593 --> 00:09:44.593
God Bless!

00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:47.057
Guys, give it up for 'Chacha'..

00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:54.211
Yogi, I am not so sure about it.

00:09:54.618 --> 00:09:56.351
Do we have any other plan?

00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.234
Then come-on guys.
 Lets do this

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.682
Wait Sir..

00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:21.087
Where are you taking these baloons inside?

00:10:21.103 --> 00:10:23.579
It's my son's birthday

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:24.714
Who son?

00:10:25.428 --> 00:10:26.428
Naveen?

00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:27.452
There is no 'Naveen' here

00:10:27.484 --> 00:10:28.563
No.. Naveen is here..

00:10:28.588 --> 00:10:29.531
What's inside the baloon?

00:10:29.556 --> 00:10:30.365
I won't give baloon's

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.698
Show me what's in the baloon's.

00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:32.452
I won't give the baloon.

00:10:32.477 --> 00:10:33.380
Show me now.

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:34.444
No.. no.

00:10:34.444 --> 00:10:35.745
Organisers. Call the police.

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:36.801
No.. don't call te police.

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:39.789
Boss..I don't want to go back to jail

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:41.063
nothing..

00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:42.178
Call the police.

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:46.063
Wait.. wait...Sir.
wait sir. He is with me. What happened?

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:48.634
If he is with you, then why
is he taking baloons inside?

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:50.058
You guys again?

00:10:50.103 --> 00:10:53.079
Security, please throw them out.
They are troubling me since morning.

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:55.071
Come..
Sir wait. Listen.

00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:57.103
What's going on here?
What's the problem?

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:01.587
Naveen?

00:11:04.913 --> 00:11:08.698
You guys are been here since morning, you
should have come to me earlier.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.530
What were you trying to do?

00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:12.345
Sir, the passes.

00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.809
I am really sorry. I didn't
know that you know them.

00:11:14.913 --> 00:11:18.198
Even if I didn 't know them, how dare you
stop people from entering the competition.

00:11:18.214 --> 00:11:19.277
I am really sorry sir.

00:11:19.302 --> 00:11:21.277
Have they not already
registerd on the website?

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.841
Don't they have their product ready?

00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:24.523
They do.. they do sir.
I am really sorry

00:11:24.556 --> 00:11:27.412
So I think you should talk to the
management and get her fired.

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:28.658
ya we should, shouldn't we?

00:11:28.707 --> 00:11:31.897
So that more teams shouldn't get
disqualified for a trivial rule.

00:11:32.064 --> 00:11:34.730
It's ok sir, she was just doing her job.

00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:44.535
Naveen..

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:45.742
Thanks Rajat.

00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:47.194
Yogendra

00:11:49.138 --> 00:11:50.138
Saurav

00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:52.344
Thank you so much sir!

00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:54.592
If we can ever return your favour

00:11:54.732 --> 00:11:56.692
My uncle's actually an LIC agent!

00:11:56.717 --> 00:12:00.011
If you need a free insurance policy...
Then here's my card!

00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:01.741
It's OK!

00:12:02.434 --> 00:12:06.180
You guys have worked so hard. This is
the least I can do for my ex-employee!

00:12:06.283 --> 00:12:07.283
Thanks Rajat!

00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:08.569
Lucky for us, we bumped into you!

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:10.209
That I would agree with!

00:12:12.243 --> 00:12:14.043
Ok... Just one small thing!

00:12:14.687 --> 00:12:15.926
Some people might feel that...

00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:19.048
Because I know from before, I'm
allowing you to participate

00:12:19.086 --> 00:12:20.086
So...

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:21.229
You know...

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:24.824
If there's a controversy, the event
managers will blame me for it!

00:12:25.006 --> 00:12:27.466
Can you just get the other
teams to sign on a paper?

00:12:27.498 --> 00:12:29.752
That they are Ok with you participating?

00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:31.982
Others as in?
All the other teams?

00:12:32.077 --> 00:12:32.919
Yaa...

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.680
Shouldn't take more
than half an hour!

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.952
Anyway, everyone will be
only eating lunch right now.

00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:39.633
See, I don't want the
other teams to feel that...

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.592
The judges are biased, right?

00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:42.919
So just for safety!

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.950
Please get the signatures! OK?

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:48.569
OK, the other judges are waiting for me.
I got to go.

00:12:49.124 --> 00:12:50.410
But Rajat...

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:52.711
What we don't get
the signatures?

00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:01.229
Without the other
teams' consent, I can not

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:04.081
allow you to talk about
your product, Naveen.

00:13:04.111 --> 00:13:05.746
Naveen you know me!

00:13:05.842 --> 00:13:08.334
However trivial the rules are...

00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:09.493
You know I...

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.473
I always like to follow them!

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.070
The event's going to start.

00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:18.589
Please get the signatures!

00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:30.069
No, I'll be reaching in the night!

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:31.767
No, no. I haven't left yet!

00:13:31.863 --> 00:13:33.910
I'll leave at around 8.

00:13:35.927 --> 00:13:39.460
Why would I reach there, in
the morning Mr. Tulsiram!

00:13:42.006 --> 00:13:45.206
I'll leave and reach there,
in the night itself!

00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:46.832
It's not the railways!

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:49.323
Jeetu's booked me a flight ticket!

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:52.341
Yes. He's got promoted!

00:13:53.961 --> 00:13:57.294
Mr. Tulsiram, can I call
you back in half an hour?

00:13:57.373 --> 00:13:58.640
OK, I'll catch you!

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:05.645
What happened?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.057
Nothing. Wanted to watch the T.V.

00:14:21.053 --> 00:14:23.253
There's a remote here, somewhere!

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:24.798
Is it there?

00:14:25.006 --> 00:14:26.163
Behind you?

00:14:46.244 --> 00:14:48.418
What do you want to watch?

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.828
3 idiots, was going to be up!

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:52.625
I'm looking for it!

00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:54.482
Have you watched it?

00:14:54.498 --> 00:14:56.132
Yes. It keeps coming up!

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.727
I've seen it in parts!

00:14:57.815 --> 00:14:59.005
You haven't watched
it completely?

00:14:59.054 --> 00:15:00.577
It's a good film!

00:15:01.006 --> 00:15:05.939
It has a good end! There's a good scene
between Madhavan and his father!

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.244
'Pati, patni aur woh!' Have you seen it?

00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:15.793
The one with Sanjeev Kumar in it!

00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:17.260
No. Not really!

00:15:17.323 --> 00:15:19.434
That too is a good film!

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:24.435
Sanjeev Kumar, leaves his wife in it
and falls in love with another woman!

00:15:24.482 --> 00:15:25.878
Gets screwed!

00:15:27.165 --> 00:15:28.259
Seen it?

00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:31.339
No. Haven't seen this particular one!

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:34.653
Switch on the 'Classic Channel'.
They might me playing it!

00:15:38.865 --> 00:15:41.205
They're playing 'Baghban' for now!

00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:42.493
It's an add break.

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:51.720
Why are watching these commercials?
Switch over to something else!

00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:54.611
Was just seeing. The add world's
completely changed these days!

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:59.378
It used to be shampoo and oil earlier.
Now it's websites and Apps!

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.710
Have you noticed how these commercials
are on the rise these days!

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:06.499
Everything's being done on
the internet these days!

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.118
Even these film actors...

00:16:08.182 --> 00:16:09.927
Are doing more commercials
for these 'Apps'.

00:16:09.975 --> 00:16:11.800
These Apps are very
uselful, by the way!

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:15.625
I booked your ticket with an App as well.
No trouble!

00:16:15.704 --> 00:16:19.498
These Apps and these companies? They're
called 'start-ups' in the beginning!

00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:22.577
There's been a different culture for...
- Yes. So what?

00:16:22.673 --> 00:16:25.284
Why are you explaining this to me?

00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:31.542
No. I was talking about it just becasue...
The commercials...

00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:38.971
You haven't got a job offer
from a start-up, have you?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.903
Is that where you go after work?

00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:44.674
Look...

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.071
Don't get into all of this...

00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:50.248
The best of guys, get stuck in this

00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:53.246
They'll say, "We don't have the money.
We'll give you shares!"

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.008
What will you do of the shares, once the
company shuts down after 6 months?

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:57.198
It's not that, dad..

00:16:57.326 --> 00:17:01.126
Don't tell me what is and what's not!
I know everything!

00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:05.579
Tell me what happened of the Umbrella
factory that Satish's son set up?

00:17:05.643 --> 00:17:06.437
We aren't making...

00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:08.294
Whatever you'll are making!

00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:12.850
What's the guarantee that the company
won't shut down in 6 months?

00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:16.857
Don'tt even think of this "start-up" thing!

00:17:16.882 --> 00:17:17.882
OK?

00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:21.924
OK?

00:17:22.862 --> 00:17:23.961
OK.

00:17:30.088 --> 00:17:32.691
The list of songs that mom had given?

00:17:32.787 --> 00:17:34.450
Go, ge them downloaded!

00:17:36.977 --> 00:17:38.135
GO!

00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:50.453
Papa!

00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:54.316
Actually, he hasn't told
you the entire story yet.

00:17:55.443 --> 00:17:58.585
Sir... Sir you've already
taken 7 of these!

00:17:58.672 --> 00:18:00.640
You're counting my lollipops?

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.062
You're counting the lollipops
of the start-ups founder?

00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:06.042
Is this your father's wedding?
Put in more!

00:18:06.093 --> 00:18:07.160
Anitesh! Listen.

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.473
Anitesh! There's a small problem!

00:18:11.887 --> 00:18:13.353
This is a big problem!

00:18:13.935 --> 00:18:15.498
So has anyone signed yet?

00:18:15.523 --> 00:18:17.951
No. But everyone's asking the same thing.

00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:19.761
That is why I've come to you!

00:18:19.793 --> 00:18:21.326
Can you please sign it?

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:24.506
Just let me finsh this 'Ras-malai', yes?

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.502
I'll be back in 2 minutes,
and then sign it, yes?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.077
Just a minute.

00:18:30.602 --> 00:18:31.802
Do you want a pen?

00:18:31.904 --> 00:18:33.971
No. I think I'm getting a call.

00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:36.515
Karunesh!

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:38.008
Yes. Yes Karunesh!

00:18:38.072 --> 00:18:39.072
Yes, tell me!

00:18:40.722 --> 00:18:42.531
There's no more Maggi at home?

00:18:42.627 --> 00:18:44.785
Can you just sign here for us?

00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:46.043
Dude... Go away!

00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:52.208
Have you heard about the <i>Nazar
Rakhsha Kawach</i>? It's very helpful

00:18:52.294 --> 00:18:57.396
My uncle's sister? A guy
used to eve-tease her...

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:04.804
Helllo? Dude if you talk dirty to Siri,
ofcourse your phone will hang on you!

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:05.547
No!

00:19:07.387 --> 00:19:08.387
No!

00:19:08.831 --> 00:19:09.831
No!

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:11.133
Go away dude!

00:19:11.355 --> 00:19:12.355
But you guys...

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.021
Really?

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:27.866
No!

00:19:31.247 --> 00:19:33.047
What? You made an omelette?

00:19:33.152 --> 00:19:35.729
I'd got those eggs to wash my hair!

00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:41.268
Anitesh! Sign it please!

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:44.594
Arrgh! I think it's loose motions!

00:19:44.722 --> 00:19:46.102
I'll be back!

00:19:58.979 --> 00:20:00.626
No!

00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:13.281
And ofcourse... Please keep in mind...

00:20:13.343 --> 00:20:16.610
That all teams have to end their
presentations within 5 minutes!

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:17.820
Now...

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:22.207
Before we start the main event of this
year's Pond's Men Energized Entrepreneur

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.280
Please... Give a big round of applause...

00:20:25.407 --> 00:20:27.121
For the third judge of the day...

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:29.330
Mr. Rajat Khanna.

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:42.391
You know...

00:20:42.422 --> 00:20:45.549
When these guys approached me
to be a judge for this event...

00:20:45.565 --> 00:20:47.613
The first question I asked was..

00:20:47.644 --> 00:20:48.802
Why me?

00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:52.749
I mean I can understand why Kunal
and Shailesh are here. But...

00:20:52.946 --> 00:20:55.819
I'm not the C.E.O. of a... What..?

00:20:55.882 --> 00:20:58.815
400 million dollar...
- Just a liitle more!

00:20:58.851 --> 00:21:02.898
Well. 400 million dollar and
counting, company like FreeCharge!

00:21:02.946 --> 00:21:07.470
And I'm not the young and dynamic G.M.
of a transportation giant like Uber!

00:21:07.486 --> 00:21:08.645
We're still a start-up!

00:21:10.918 --> 00:21:12.986
And I'm certainly not Narayan Murthy!

00:21:14.204 --> 00:21:16.804
So they said, "No, no. You've been a...

00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:18.690
An integral member of the MoKart team

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:23.140
And so you're responsible for it's
expansion in over 50 countries.

00:21:26.937 --> 00:21:29.214
I said, "Yes, I was
certainly a member of the

00:21:29.238 --> 00:21:31.365
team. But whether I was
integral or not...

00:21:31.397 --> 00:21:33.661
...only my Board of
Directors can tell you.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.222
You know... The real reason...

00:21:37.349 --> 00:21:41.311
I want to be here... And I'm here today...
Is you guys!

00:21:41.349 --> 00:21:43.498
I mean, look at this. This is amazing!

00:21:43.524 --> 00:21:48.832
It makes my heart burst with joy to see
a room full of young entrepreneurs!

00:21:49.024 --> 00:21:53.225
You know... You guys are creating a
revolution. And you don't even know it!

00:21:53.358 --> 00:21:54.897
Mark my words...

00:21:55.309 --> 00:21:58.072
The face of this nation
is going to be changed...

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.628
Not by politicians or film-stars...

00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:04.595
It's going to be changed by...
Entrepreneurs!

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:15.899
- So, without taking up much more of your
time, let's get going. Good Luck everyone!

00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:22.613
It's OK dude!

00:22:22.646 --> 00:22:23.963
We tried!

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:26.224
Don't worry about it now!

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.097
Head back home, then?

00:22:28.177 --> 00:22:31.710
If we take the highway, we'll
also avoid the highway!

00:22:31.735 --> 00:22:33.145
Shut him up, Yogi!

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.494
But Naveen, for once I agree with him.

00:22:37.542 --> 00:22:39.675
Already, a lot's happened today!

00:22:40.097 --> 00:22:43.208
Let's not screw ourselves by
getting up onto the stage now!

00:22:43.558 --> 00:22:44.891
Come. Let's go back.

00:22:47.796 --> 00:22:49.000
No Yogi!

00:22:49.748 --> 00:22:51.215
We can't just go back!

00:22:53.303 --> 00:22:56.837
We've been fighting since
so many days, for this one!

00:22:56.859 --> 00:23:01.198
We won't get to meet so many
investors in one place again.

00:23:02.701 --> 00:23:05.501
We're definitely getting on to the stage!

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.209
But what will we do after
going on the stage?

00:23:19.885 --> 00:23:22.377
What work will you do in your start-up?

00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:23.757
Coding!

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:28.315
If coding's what you wanted to do, what's
the point of quitting such a good company?

00:23:28.362 --> 00:23:31.092
Dad, how do I explain this to you?
- No. No. Explain it!

00:23:31.124 --> 00:23:33.191
But look into my eyes and talk!

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:39.155
Dad. There is no job
satisfaction in this job!

00:23:39.235 --> 00:23:41.555
There is no fun in working
in such companies.

00:23:41.635 --> 00:23:42.635
Fun.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.355
You work for fun ?

00:23:46.355 --> 00:23:49.355
I have been working in a
bank for 32 years. For fun?

00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:52.755
I manage other people's account for fun?

00:23:52.955 --> 00:23:57.035
It's because I get my salary
on the first day of the month.

00:23:57.395 --> 00:24:00.355
You had such a nice job.
PF..LTA.. You had everything.

00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:03.315
Left everything and started
this after marriage !

00:24:04.715 --> 00:24:06.835
Anyways, let it be.

00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:09.035
You  have a  good resume.

00:24:09.435 --> 00:24:12.355
Start applying for jobs!
You'll find one in 2-3 months.

00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:13.133
Okay?

00:24:15.435 --> 00:24:16.795
Papa I have already...

00:24:16.835 --> 00:24:17.835
Okay?

00:24:23.355 --> 00:24:25.570
Papa, it's not okay.

00:24:27.475 --> 00:24:30.421
He wants to stay a
part of the startup.

00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:34.075
Aren't you guys getting it?

00:24:34.355 --> 00:24:36.435
Suppose that the company doesn't work..

00:24:36.515 --> 00:24:38.555
Startup fails! Then what will you'll  do ?

00:24:38.635 --> 00:24:40.915
But atleast give him a chance to fail.

00:24:40.995 --> 00:24:44.292
I see a ditch right infront,
should I let him fall?

00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:51.412
During your board exams I was supposed to
be sent to jaipur as the branch manager.

00:24:51.475 --> 00:24:56.752
I didn't take the promotion so that changing
schools wouldn't affect your studies!

00:24:56.875 --> 00:25:00.155
I have always told you, "Study
how much ever you want..

00:25:00.195 --> 00:25:03.195
 I will take a loan and pay for it.

00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:06.748
And today too, I'm stopping
you for your own good

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:10.075
But dad, till when will
you think about his good?

00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:11.915
As a parent all you can do is...

00:25:12.075 --> 00:25:13.075
Prepare him.

00:25:15.315 --> 00:25:16.355
So that he can deal with his  problems.

00:25:16.475 --> 00:25:17.795
And you have done that.

00:25:18.995 --> 00:25:20.995
You can teach a kid but...

00:25:21.235 --> 00:25:23.155
...he'll have to give his
own exam, wouldn't he?

00:25:24.955 --> 00:25:28.795
Okay then, there is no point
in me saying anything.

00:25:34.435 --> 00:25:38.475
Papa, even you had taken the risk of
leaving the promotion for his future..

00:25:38.635 --> 00:25:40.835
And now when he is leaving
his job for his own future...

00:25:40.995 --> 00:25:42.315
have atleast some faith in him.

00:25:42.355 --> 00:25:44.955
You believe in a
25 year old company ...

00:25:45.075 --> 00:25:48.315
How can I believe in a company that is new
and consists of 4 inexperienced younsters!

00:25:48.475 --> 00:25:51.595
Papa,even that 25 year old company would
have someday started with just four people.

00:25:51.635 --> 00:25:53.995
And the day that 1 company started...

00:25:54.035 --> 00:25:56.795
99 other similar companies shutdown.

00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:00.410
Probability, Jitu.

00:26:00.635 --> 00:26:01.755
1/100

00:26:02.675 --> 00:26:04.875
If you had learnt that chapter
properly then your rank...

00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:05.795
and decision,

00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:07.875
both would have been better.

00:26:09.555 --> 00:26:11.635
Papa, listen..

00:26:11.755 --> 00:26:13.795
Papa, please wait..

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:23.013
Sorry.

00:26:24.075 --> 00:26:25.515
It's because of me....

00:26:25.798 --> 00:26:27.552
Why are you crying?

00:26:28.803 --> 00:26:31.123
He wouldn't have waited.

00:26:31.955 --> 00:26:34.115
Shouldn't have told him
anything, in the first place!

00:26:34.915 --> 00:26:36.395
Are you mad! Stop crying.

00:26:36.543 --> 00:26:37.718
Please stop...

00:26:37.995 --> 00:26:39.475
Shouldn't have said anything.

00:26:39.555 --> 00:26:43.746
Do you know, no one has ever done
something like this for me before!

00:26:43.979 --> 00:26:47.372
You tried! But believe me,
he would've never waited.

00:26:47.835 --> 00:26:49.755
Why are you being sorry?

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.075
I should be thanking you.

00:26:52.115 --> 00:26:53.404
Okay now stop.

00:26:53.435 --> 00:26:54.678
Listen..

00:26:54.795 --> 00:26:55.974
Listen..

00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:59.195
We had an arrange marriage
so I've never told you...

00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:02.640
that..

00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:07.669
I love you.

00:27:14.635 --> 00:27:17.185
I love you too.

00:27:25.835 --> 00:27:27.875
Sorry sorry for interupting but..

00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:32.395
I cannot order mattresses,curtains
anything else on the app?

00:27:32.515 --> 00:27:34.395
No, not even pillow covers..

00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:36.345
and I, am proud of it.

00:27:36.435 --> 00:27:39.875
We here at pillow willow are
focusing only on one thing..

00:27:39.955 --> 00:27:40.595
Pillows.

00:27:40.715 --> 00:27:42.820
Atleast for the next three quarters.

00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:45.235
We want to be like Flipkart.

00:27:45.595 --> 00:27:46.275
but..

00:27:46.395 --> 00:27:48.739
only for pillows.

00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:50.218
But..

00:27:50.555 --> 00:27:54.898
But flipkart already has pillows, right?

00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:03.275
I guess that's about it, you can carry on.

00:28:05.515 --> 00:28:08.755
Alright. Thank you.
 Nishant and team everyone.

00:28:08.795 --> 00:28:11.355
Next up, we have team no. 22.

00:28:11.595 --> 00:28:13.315
Please welcome Naveen Bhansal,

00:28:13.395 --> 00:28:17.715
Saurabh Mandal from IIM Indore.

00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:19.275
and Yogendra Pandey

00:28:19.315 --> 00:28:23.535
Guys, the stage is yours
for the next five minutes.

00:28:29.715 --> 00:28:32.342
Hello everyone.

00:28:44.915 --> 00:28:46.220
Hello everyone.

00:28:46.562 --> 00:28:48.492
I'm Naveen Bhansal.

00:28:49.115 --> 00:28:51.395
I'm sure every one of you
have met either me or

00:28:51.435 --> 00:28:53.635
one of my team members
in the past one hour.

00:28:53.755 --> 00:28:55.435
We are the same guys who were like

00:28:55.547 --> 00:28:57.834
pleading, begging...

00:28:58.025 --> 00:29:00.287
And in some cases, even threatening you!

00:29:00.355 --> 00:29:03.235
To get one lousy signature on this page..

00:29:03.715 --> 00:29:08.326
 which says its okay for us to present
our product on this stage..

00:29:08.475 --> 00:29:09.484
 but..

00:29:09.595 --> 00:29:12.595
as you can see ofcourse,
we didn't even come close.

00:29:13.075 --> 00:29:15.915
Well, I am really sorry Naveen but

00:29:16.115 --> 00:29:19.952
 I am afraid I can't allow you to go on

00:29:20.115 --> 00:29:24.228
It wouldn't be fair to the other teams if
I allow you to talk about your product..

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:26.715
 so could we have the next
 team on stage please ?

00:29:26.795 --> 00:29:28.235
But Sir you said..

00:29:28.351 --> 00:29:30.994
We're not allowed to present
our product on stage...

00:29:31.033 --> 00:29:32.767
But I still have my 5 minutes, right?

00:29:36.137 --> 00:29:38.462
Okay you have..

00:29:38.555 --> 00:29:40.155
 4 minutes 20 seconds.

00:29:45.355 --> 00:29:47.348
I have some friends in the U.S.

00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:49.848
Who work in the  silicon valley

00:29:50.614 --> 00:29:54.094
They say that over there when an
 entrepreneur comes up with a startup..

00:29:54.328 --> 00:29:56.757
the first question people
ask him is, "What?"

00:29:57.106 --> 00:29:59.343
"What is the product?"

00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:01.715
And in India instead of what..

00:30:01.804 --> 00:30:03.166
people ask "Why?"

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.128
Why entrepreneurship ?

00:30:07.063 --> 00:30:09.263
Today we are facing a similar challenge.

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:12.277
Like nobody is willing to
 listen to our "What?"

00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:15.076
So let me talk about..

00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:16.662
The why.

00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.229
Why entrepreneurship?

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.128
Don't know.

00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:25.400
May be I was fed up of my well
 wisher boss, in my corporate job.

00:30:25.852 --> 00:30:30.360
Or maybe I got too inspired from
 Social network or Wolf of Wall Street.

00:30:31.352 --> 00:30:32.423
Or maybe

00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:35.715
I always loved solving real life problems

00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.156
Okay, do you guys remember..

00:30:39.235 --> 00:30:42.755
In 90's we used to get free tazoos
 inside a packet of chips?

00:30:42.843 --> 00:30:48.200
Those gold shiny disc tazoos which had
 cartoon characters drawn on it.

00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:50.115
I used to be like crazy about them.

00:30:50.235 --> 00:30:53.355
You know all I wanted was
100s and 100s of tazos.

00:30:53.582 --> 00:30:56.855
Which I could store in an empty jam jar.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:01.290
But my pocket money let me buy
only one packet a week.

00:31:01.756 --> 00:31:05.865
where my friends had 25-30
 I could manage only five.

00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:10.195
Now you guys would be thinking,
'It's such a trivial problem..

00:31:10.263 --> 00:31:14.270
But at that point of time for a 10 year old
 kid it was a huge life problem

00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:16.335
And it needed to be solved.

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:18.414
Then a thought occured to me..

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.021
I sat at home and I
scratched all the tazos..

00:31:21.075 --> 00:31:23.435
using coins, till they got white.

00:31:24.136 --> 00:31:26.356
Next day when I went to school

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.620
news spread...

00:31:27.835 --> 00:31:30.155
that Naven has a special kind of  tazos.

00:31:30.275 --> 00:31:31.712
Blank tazos.

00:31:31.787 --> 00:31:35.859
On which you can draw your own
favourite cartoon character.

00:31:36.965 --> 00:31:39.899
And suddenly everybody wanted it.

00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:45.324
People were ready to exchange
their 5- 10..20 tazos

00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:47.932
Just to get that one special tazo.

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:52.219
Later, a month later, I
went to the shop, again..

00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:54.331
But..

00:31:54.475 --> 00:31:56.721
not to buy a packet of chips..

00:31:56.795 --> 00:31:58.980
But a new jam jar.

00:32:00.749 --> 00:32:04.176
That was my life's first buisness model.

00:32:04.354 --> 00:32:06.308
I had many ventures, after that as well!

00:32:06.435 --> 00:32:08.755
In school, using my computer I wrote CDs.

00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:13.523
In college using local sponsors
I published my own magazine.

00:32:16.755 --> 00:32:20.094
But between then and now...

00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:22.080
There's a very prominent difference.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.719
Today I am scared.

00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:31.740
Competition is so ruthless.

00:32:32.315 --> 00:32:33.915
You know standing here today..

00:32:34.138 --> 00:32:39.471
I don't feel like an entrepreneur. I feel
as if I'm a contestant in a reality show!

00:32:40.756 --> 00:32:44.241
And I'm going to get eliminated,
without even performing.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.280
Actually today's judge

00:32:47.455 --> 00:32:50.582
My ex boss Mr. Rajat Khanna had
sumed up the competition in a...

00:32:50.595 --> 00:32:52.355
very simple sentence.

00:32:52.987 --> 00:32:55.704
He says that in today's
date you'll find a startup

00:32:55.729 --> 00:32:58.611
founder sitting in atleast
2 out of 3 cubicals.

00:32:58.995 --> 00:33:01.554
Then where do I stand in between
 so many people.

00:33:01.622 --> 00:33:04.864
I will start doubting my capability.

00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:08.711
Then I thought what do
those 'Big entrepreneurs'

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:11.267
who came before me
have, that I don't .

00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:13.948
I have my education, my wits.

00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:16.571
I have a team that stands resolutely behind me.

00:33:16.677 --> 00:33:19.248
Then technically I should be
successfull  as well, right?

00:33:19.526 --> 00:33:20.931
Well not necessarily.

00:33:22.555 --> 00:33:25.795
You know those guys had one more
 extra thing in common

00:33:25.987 --> 00:33:28.607
which was perhaps the most crucial thing.

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:31.994
They refused to give up.

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.748
They refused to give up.

00:33:36.015 --> 00:33:37.943
You can take any entrepreneur's biography..

00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:39.569
It's filled with phrases.

00:33:39.755 --> 00:33:41.278
Like, 'A  shot in the dark'.

00:33:41.309 --> 00:33:42.829
'Fighting against the odds.'

00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:45.627
'Exploring uncharted territories.'

00:33:46.155 --> 00:33:47.844
Then why am I scared to fail at..

00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:49.291
such an early stage.

00:33:49.435 --> 00:33:51.915
Nobody invented an engine their first time.

00:33:52.235 --> 00:33:56.530
Nobody discovered an island their first time
but they kept on trying, they kept working.

00:33:56.595 --> 00:33:58.835
If the room is dark and you want to
switch on the bulb..

00:33:59.115 --> 00:34:00.955
Try all the switches!

00:34:01.195 --> 00:34:05.180
Some or the other will
definitely do the job.

00:34:05.795 --> 00:34:07.115
Gandhiji once said..

00:34:07.515 --> 00:34:09.115
"If you have any problem in life..

00:34:09.155 --> 00:34:10.435
It's got only one solution..

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.347
Grind your feet, and work for it!"

00:34:12.915 --> 00:34:17.303
These mentors, angel investors, events these
external factors are not in my hand..

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:19.395
I have control only over my work..

00:34:19.555 --> 00:34:23.962
And whenever I get the opportunity,
I'll work my ass off and kill it.

00:34:24.475 --> 00:34:27.555
A similar opportunity was tried to be
taken away from me today!

00:34:27.595 --> 00:34:29.235
I could have given up and gone back.

00:34:29.355 --> 00:34:32.118
But I chose to stand
here and face you guys.

00:34:33.195 --> 00:34:36.991
Because entrepreneurs do not
lose out on opportunities.

00:34:37.555 --> 00:34:41.829
Rajat you'd told me that I can't
 be on stage and sell my product.

00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:45.117
So I sold myself.

00:34:45.715 --> 00:34:47.769
Thanks guys.

00:35:11.355 --> 00:35:13.754
What was the need to be a hero?

00:35:14.115 --> 00:35:16.091
Everyone likes Rajat

00:35:16.395 --> 00:35:18.795
And you insulted him on stage.

00:35:19.435 --> 00:35:21.315
It will generate negative publicity.

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:23.106
Atleast we're getting publicity.

00:35:23.635 --> 00:35:25.275
Anyway who cared about us.

00:35:25.595 --> 00:35:27.395
Atleast in this way we
 got 4 visiting cards.

00:35:27.635 --> 00:35:28.995
All were the "Call my secretary" type.

00:35:29.115 --> 00:35:30.715
You know "Call my secretary", right?.

00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:32.595
We're not getting a meeting
atleast for a month.

00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:34.914
It is better than getting no visting cards.

00:35:35.075 --> 00:35:37.024
I googled it.

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:40.687
When did Gandhiji say
"Grind your feet, and work for it!"

00:35:40.915 --> 00:35:42.709
Yeah. That I was only blabbering!

00:35:42.835 --> 00:35:43.355
Ahaan! Naveen!

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:44.812
Only blabbering, haan?

00:35:45.048 --> 00:35:47.995
You copy pasted the third year Hindi
Elocution speech again, didn't you!

00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:50.155
No, I feel if you add a
celebrity name after

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.622
a quote then it has double the impact!

00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:57.735
Why are you so happy?

00:35:58.253 --> 00:36:00.054
Uncle left in anger.

00:36:00.546 --> 00:36:01.946
What will you do when he comes back

00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:04.070
We'll see when it happens!

00:36:05.518 --> 00:36:07.551
You had sex, didn't you!

00:36:13.643 --> 00:36:16.335
What are you doing, Yogi.
It's 8 in the evening.

00:36:19.315 --> 00:36:21.322
Naveen Bhansal?

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.417
Brilliant speech today, man.

00:36:26.847 --> 00:36:29.211
Social media is going crazy with your video.

00:36:29.298 --> 00:36:31.780
You've  replaced Rahul Yadav.
All founders...

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.098
all VCs are only talking about you.

00:36:34.475 --> 00:36:35.275
Infact..

00:36:35.595 --> 00:36:36.595
a while ago

00:36:36.725 --> 00:36:38.475
Arun Jaitley tweeted about you.

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:39.629
What! really?

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.050
Just kidding.

00:36:41.449 --> 00:36:42.895
You didn't do anything that big.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.620
But

00:36:44.764 --> 00:36:47.402
There's an article about
you in "Yourstory".

00:36:47.795 --> 00:36:52.314
By the way, I am Punith.. I work
for a VC firm and this is my card.

00:36:53.201 --> 00:36:56.495
I saw your idea in Nascom comclave.

00:36:57.225 --> 00:36:58.381
Quite interesting.

00:36:58.715 --> 00:37:02.758
Why don't you guys drop in at
our office for a pitch sometime.

00:37:03.108 --> 00:37:04.225
Sure.

00:37:05.036 --> 00:37:05.822
We would love too.

00:37:05.917 --> 00:37:06.869
So.

00:37:08.036 --> 00:37:10.047
Call my secretay.

00:37:14.475 --> 00:37:16.835
Infact you know what scratch that..

00:37:17.155 --> 00:37:19.275
I am free on Thursday afternoon..

00:37:19.555 --> 00:37:20.955
What are you guys doing?
