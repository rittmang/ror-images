No.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.600
It's very risky.

Sir, tell me one thing.

How many big bulls
are there in India?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.640
Only two. You and I.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.280
So, we are made for each other.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400
We've reached where we are,
because we took risks.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.720
Right?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.160
Sir, it's very simple.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000
You just have to issue
cheques in the name of Grindlays.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.360
It's just a ready-forward deal
for you.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.680
But...

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.880
I would need...

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.120
...BRs from Grindlays in return.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.840
And you will get them. Definitely.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.400
Leave that to me.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.360
It's just a matter of 15 days.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.520
And in 15 days, NHB will get
its money back.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.480
And Sir, the Delhi offer stands.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.160
It's Harshad's guarantee to you, sir.

- Do you understand that?
- Sir.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.960
Why are you thinking
of going down...

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.840
...when the messages
are coming from up?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.440
Huh?

Yes.

It will take time
to comprehend.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.000
It's a financial scam.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.080
We will need
to investigate it differently.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.280
Scam.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.200
Sir, it's a new word
for a big theft.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.680
I get that.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.560
It's a financial fraud.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.640
Transactions are very complicated.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.880
Sir, if we go into details,
we will get caught in a web of numbers.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.040
So, I'm saying, let's just focus
on what we know.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.120
It's a theft.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.920
And there is only one way
to investigate thieves, sir.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.320
Hmm.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.240
Go ahead.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.480
Do it your way.
There won't be any pressure.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.480
But, remember one thing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.560
This scam is 50 times bigger
than Bofors.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600
It can be murkier than Bofors.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.320
Plus, the Government
and the media...

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.040
...will keep the pressure up.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.360
Sir, what's new in that?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.960
We are used to that.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.480

Okay. Superb.

Sucheta, don't you think
this can be some sort of a trap?

Who will try to trap me? Harshad?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.880
Don't worry.
He isn't a villain from a movie.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.320
Anyway, if anything happens
to me now...

doubt him.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880
He is a smart Gujarati.
He won't be so stupid.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.760
So, where did this mystery Bond call from?

Okay. Let's agree that Harshad
is a smart Gujarati.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.720
But because of him, a lot of
stupid people are getting anxious.

Sucheta, it's a 5,000 crore scam.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.200
- A lot of people are involved.
- I know.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.560
- From top to the bottom.
- Sucheta madam.

- Yes, follow me.

This is standard practice
in the money-market.

It may be unofficial,
but everyone does it.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.960
Once I buy the securities, the money
will be transferred to my account.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.240
After all, I'm the one
who has to repay it.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.840
Isn't it logical?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.440
Everyone does it to save time.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.920
And I'm returning NHB's 500 crores,
as soon as possible.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.440
You don't worry.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.800
Your name will be cleared, 100 percent.

Trust is still something
that's very expensive.

I have no other option...

The most important one.

I just hope he is
dressed appropriately.

Come on. He is an amateur.

He doesn't know the difference between
swinging a cricket bat and a golf club.

But he thought
he could swing the markets.

This cricketer won't come
to the golf course with his bat, will he?

I still don't get it.

Why is he coming
to the golf course to meet you?

or the stairs...

...the only way, is down.

I also have a proverb for you.

Is the brain mightier, or the bull?

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.560
Of course, you'd say the bull, right?

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.120
...because you've forgotten
how to use your brain.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.320
Or else, you wouldn't have shown off
and thrown proverbs at him...

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.080
...and walked away without a deal...

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.680
You'd better find a buyer fast.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.320
These CBI guys are crazy.
They can do anything.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.440
They can even slap you.

He is a proud man.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.960
It will take some time.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.760
But sir, just one more session...

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.080
...and he will confess
without a second thought.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.600
He is a man whose pride
has been wounded.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.160
People like him can't sleep.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.240
He won't take much time.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.320
Right, sir.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.920
Till then, let's focus
on Mr. Harshad Mehta, sir.

The more time he gets...

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.440
...he will find a way to save himself.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.400
But, Madhavan, remember.
He is a smart chap.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.920
Be careful with him.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.760
[Das] 'He has some very powerful people
protecting him.'

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.760
Right.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.680
[Das] 'Make sure you leave no
loopholes before bringing him to book.'

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.920
Right, sir.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.160
When we bring him in, sir,
it will be for good.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.320
I won't take much of your time.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.960
I just have one little question.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.200
You are in charge of treasury
and investment management division.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.800
- Yes...
- Right?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.520
Right. And yet, you weren't aware
that your subordinates...

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.960
...were in cahoots with Harshad
in such a plunder?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.240
- You see...
- [Khemani clears throat]

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.800
My job is to get the best deal
for my employer, SBI.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.520
- Right.
- That's it.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.720
It's Sitaraman's job to execute
the actual transactions.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.880
- That was his job.
- Okay...

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.280
I mean...

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.400
...I can't be responsible
for his botch-ups, you know.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:28.800
Right.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.680
If he tells me...

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.440
...that he has received
the delivery of securities...

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.880
Then what can I do?

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.080
- Correct.
- I trusted him.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.520
But he lied.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.520
Okay.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.960
You trusted him?

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.960
- Yes.
- Okay...

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.160
- And he lied.
- Absolutely.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.040
Okay...

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.080
Now I understand.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.520
You know, Mr. Khemani,
I have many subordinates...

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.360
...and I have to rely
on their work.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.200
- Yes.
- And I really trust them. Really trust them.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.080
But if any of my subordinates...

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.120
...would have done such a plunder...

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.360
I would've slapped him so hard
that he would pee in his pants.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.160
But then maybe your job
does not allow you to be violent.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.840
Yeah. It doesn't actually.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.600
My job...

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.360
...allows me to be violent.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240
Sometimes.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.520
Just one thing I want to know.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.440
I mean, I'm curious. That's all.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.280
See, if you really wanted to exercise
control over Sitaraman...

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.080
[Madhavan] '...you could have done it.
Right?'

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.320
'Yes or no?'

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.320
Yes or no, Mr. Khemani?

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.720
Just a yes or a no.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.080
I'll be more comfortable
in my cabin...

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.320
What? Louder.
I can't hear you.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.720
My staff is watching.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.040
Louder...
Louder, please.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.280
Staff is looking at us.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.280
What are you looking at?
Do your work.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.440
- I mean... I'll be comfortable there.
- Yeah. Let's go.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.200
- Come on, let's go.
- Please. Sorry, sir.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.560
You trust me, right?

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600
- Yes... Absolutely.
- Come.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.600
Your locker looks more like
Bappi Lahiri's than yours.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.120
So much jewellery.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.280
Actually, my daughter is
getting married. That's why.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.840
Why drag your daughter into this,
my poor father?

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.440
Even for the wedding, how did you
get so much jewellery?

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.280
My daughter bought it
with her money.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.880
- Okay. Her money.
- Yes.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.720
- What's your daughter's name?
- Anita.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.800
Anitha.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.080
Anita with a "T".

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.520
- Anita. Okay.
- "Ta".

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.040
What does she do?

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.320
Well...

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.840
It must be a good job.
So much jewellery, after all.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.600
Okay?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.960
She can earn and buy
so much jewellery.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.280
But she can't have her own locker?

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.280
[Kamat stammers]

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.720
[Madhavan] 'Strange.'

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.200
'The thing is, Mr. Kamat...'

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.800
...we will have to seal the locker.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.320
-[Kamat] 'Sir!'
- Unfortunately.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.400
Sir, the wedding is in a few days.
You can't seal the locker.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.320
Right...

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.960
You see, you have sealed
your mouth...

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.840
...so we also need to seal
something, right?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.160
- Or we will be left behind.
- Sir.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.800
One more advice.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.160
Instead of the locker,
you should worry about the lock-up.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.960
-[Kamat] 'Sir.'
- Look, if you get arrested...

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.920
...who will give away
your daughter at the wedding?

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.640
I am very busy.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.120
Sir, please sir.
Sir...

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.960
- Congratulations for the wedding.
- Sir...

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.920
Have a good day.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.320
Sir.

[Madhavan] 'After talking
to all these people...'

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.320
'...I've begun to feel...'

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.400
...that you are the real boss
of SBI.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.880
SBI. Sitaraman Bank of India.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.160
Isn't it?

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.560
Sir, I didn't do anything.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.440
All your seniors are saying
that you did it.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.040
Everyone is taking your name.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.840
You are a VIP, aren't you?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.920
You travel by air to Palani.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.560
Do you or not?

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.960
I don't know, sir...

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.960
- Senior...
- Hey! Don't you know Hindi?

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.920
- Tamil-Tamil...
- I'm from Delhi. Got it?

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.080
Speak in Hindi.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.320
What can happen without
the authority of the seniors, sir?

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.400
You say nothing happens without
the approval of the seniors.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.360
Seniors say
they don't know anything...

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.640
...it's all the junior's doing.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.480
What should I do?

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.320
Sitaraman <i>ji</i>, I have no interest
in banking technicalities.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.080
I just want to know the name.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.560
So, tell me the names
of all those who are involved.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.720
Otherwise, in today's day and age...

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.040
...you will have to take
a trial by fire.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.040
Got it?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.920
Think about it.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.000
Seniors will go scott-free.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.240
You will be f**ked.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.840
Now, do you know?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.680
Good.

of Investigation, today froze...</i>

Everything is ruined.

The curse of CBI has struck.

All our bank accounts are frozen.

Don't always ask questions.

Harshad, do you understand

Do you think the CBI will go
after the Prime Minister Office?

Local police will obviously say
it's heart attack.

They want to pretend
it was a natural death.

Are you sure?

It's true.

They conducted a raid at his house

I don't understand anything.

I don't understand...

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.080
...how CBI can just take Ashwin <i>Bhai</i>
and Harshad from home?

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.600
Later, we come to know
that they've been arrested.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.920
I don't understand...

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.200
...that in our country,
so many terrorists...

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.600
...criminals and corrupt leaders
are roaming about freely...

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.360
...but CBI won't arrest them. Why?

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.520
Because Harshad is a threat
to the country.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.040
Isn't it?

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.360
You must be thinking this too.

been a problem...

Look at the people living here.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.200
Are we a threat to the country?

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.800
Madam, a man's story is more important
to you, than the man himself.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.480
That's the fact.

Why are you telling me?
Put the phone down.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.200
What's wrong?

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.120
Harshad's been arrested.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.600
Now?

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:05.880
Now, what?

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.960
He told me
that the market will rise.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.640
I borrowed money
on interest. Now I am stuck.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.760
The moment people come to know
that Harshad has been arrested...

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.200
...they will come here, pestering us
to return their money.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.800
Where will we get the money?

[Madhavan] 'Mr. Mehta,
how do you like our office?'

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.320
It's not 15,000 square feet.
Must feel small to you.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.320
It's hot, isn't it?

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.840
Should I switch on the fan?

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.520
I'll have to call an electrician.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.440
Exhale from your mouth.
It will cool you down.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.760
It works.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.440
We had the same problem
in the school where I studied.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.520
There were fans, but no electricity.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.080
This is how I passed the seventh
grade. By taking deep breaths.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.440
Really.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.320
Forget it.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.800
Let's start from the beginning.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.840
Meaning?

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.600
Meaning, when and how did you...

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.320
...systematically steal
from the State Bank of India?

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:13.960
Go on.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.200
Tell me. We have a lot of time.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.440
Go on. Tell me in detail.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.440
How long will you stay
mum, Mr. Mehta?

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.640
Sitaraman has told me everything.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.200
That's why I advise you...

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.200
...to tell the truth.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.360
Otherwise...

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.200
What did I have
at your house? <i>Gathia</i>.

I'll turn your b***s into <i>gathia</i>.

'...to tell me.'

What did you do with the money
you looted from State Bank of India?

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.840
I haven't looted any money.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.680
I've paid back everything.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.680
Okay.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.800
And from where did you get
the money to repay it?

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.040
It must have come from somewhere?

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.920
One theft to hide another...
then another, to hide that one...

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.400
You've made so many thefts, it will
take time to uncover all of them.

'Till then...'

'...be our guest.'

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.400
Harshad didn't get bail.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.680
Why?

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.880
They said that they want
to investigate him further.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.360
Are they done investigating you?

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.440
Harshad is the only one
in custody now.

Ashwin <i>Bhai</i>,
there's one thing.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.880
The special court had appointed
a custodian...

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.160
I know...

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.360
He wants to attach
all our assets.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.680
Yes. This is the detail
of all our assets.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.600
You and Harshad need
to sign this.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.480
-[Ashwin sighs]
- Give.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.520
Give me a pen.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.640
Now if the court has ordered it,

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.080
we will have to attach the assets.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.680
What option do we have?

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.960
Ashwin <i>Bhai</i>,
at least glance at them once?

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.160
You've seen it, haven't you?
That's enough.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.440
Fine.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.920
You have to change your strategy.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.800
Crush his hopes.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.920
Make him believe
that if he doesn't co-operate...

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.400
...he will rot in custody
for the rest of his life.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.400
-[Madhavan inhales]
- Just do that.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.280
Do you know the number
of cases against you?

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.840
Thirty-one.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.800
Defrauding SBI.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.120
UCO Bank bill discounting case.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.680
Maruti Udyog defrauding case.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.200
SBI Cap defrauding case.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.920
That means...

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.440
If you get bail in one case,
there will be a second.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.960
If you get bail in the second case,
there will be a third.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.880
You're going to be so badly b******d...

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.880

stitch your bum back ever.

...they will start badgering you.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.960
Isn't it good?

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.960
Bring him some mosquito repellent.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.960
Not possible, sir.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.440

We can't, sir.

all his blood. Lock it.

of the Harshad Mehta story...

...but RBI's investigation is still on.

sooner or later...

to other people.
