WEBVTT

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.000
Straight back to the kitchen?
Just leave the vegetables.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.760
This won't do.
Go take some rest.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960
What do I do?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.520
Till I don't enter the kitchen,
it doesn't feel like home.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.040
Watch this, I'll be back.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.840
It's 1000 rupees.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.480
Harshad <i>Bhai</i> is planning something, right?
It will all work out soon.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.160
I'm getting a job... in Sri Lanka.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.320
All the way to Sri Lanka?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.680
I can't keep sitting
idle at home, can I?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.760
You work so hard at the parlour...
and then all the household chores...

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.080
Are you done?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.160
The parlour is paying enough
to run the house, right?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.120
And I like working there.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.920
They're increasing
my salary next month.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.640
Listen to me.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.360
Weren't you the one
telling Harshad <i>Bhai</i>...

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.960
...that time is a great healer?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.080
So then, time needs some time.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.000
Just two minutes, <i>Pappa</i>.
Dinner is almost ready.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.600
How much do we still owe
Suresh <i>Bhai</i>?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.160
It's a loss of 10 lakhs.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840
We've returned three,
seven lakhs are pending.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.040
When one has gold at home...

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.320
...one sleeps peacefully.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.800
Why do you think our elders
collected gold?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.280
So when hard times come...

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.560
- ...they can...
- Shanti <i>Bhai</i>, don't worry at all.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.320
Harshad and Ashwin are
like family to me.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.960
Yes. But I had warned Harshad...

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.200
...to be careful.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.840
You know how it is...
When it rains...

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.200
...even if you have an umbrella...

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.760
...you can still fall
on a slippery road.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.800
I'm not the only one,
the entire market has slipped.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.560
And when it was raining money,
no one bothered opening their umbrellas.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.360
- Everyone was busy getting drenched.
- But everything has washed away now!

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.520
- There's nothing left.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.040
We are sitting here with
our family gold!

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.960
Please calm down...

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.440
[Suresh] 'It happens.'

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.800
I'm sorry, Suresh <i>Bhai</i>.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.280
Suresh <i>Bhai</i>,
these are my property papers.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.600
The flat and this gold...

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.280
...should cover your seven lakhs.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.880
What are you saying, Shanti <i>Bhai</i>?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.800
There's no need for
these property papers.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.920
The money isn't running away, is it?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.440
Well, in that case,
why don't you restart our trading account?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.120
I might be able to pay you back sooner.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.720
Look Harshad...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.680
...you earned three lakhs
in three years.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
And you lost 10 lakhs in 10 minutes.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.760
So, obviously the stock market
is not that easy...

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.960
...that you will get in and
start minting right away.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.880
So, until you return the full amount,
your trading account will remain suspended.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.000
[Suresh] 'The boy is smart
but he wants to charge ahead.'

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.120
He needs to learn how to walk first...

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.360
How come you're still up?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.720
No, well...

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.280
...I think I ate too much.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.160
I did take some digestive.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.440
You tell me.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.120
Why are you awake?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.800
There's a meeting tomorrow.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.800
Once our trading account
is up and running...

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.640
- ...then see...
- Harshad.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.560
You always swim against the tide.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.000
You dream during the day
and stay up at night.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.560
It's not like your trading account
will restart if you stay awake.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.680
Go to sleep. Okay?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.560
You're scared, aren't you?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.360
...that we might have
to leave Bombay again?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.320
No... Nothing like that.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.480
<i>Pappa.</i>

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.600
Never lie to the night.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.480
The night holds all our secrets.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.400
My stock-broker son...

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.240
...when did you turn into a poet?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.480
As long as I live...

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.440
...I won't let Bombay Stock Exchange
out of my sight.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.760
And BSE is right here, in Bombay.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.320
So Mr. Shantilal, go sleep in peace.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.080
[Screaming]

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.960
[sobbing]

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.200
[Harshad] 'So Mr. Shantilal...'

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.480
Had we known earlier,
we could've taken him to the hospital.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.960
And how would we afford
the hospital bills?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.200
It's for the better.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.600
He passed away in his sleep peacefully.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.400
He was most worried about you.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.360
'Worrying is a sure path to your pyre'.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.480
That's what Mr. Shantilal used to say.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.400
[Title Montage]

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.880
I knew that Telco and Zenith would surge.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.320
I could have made a solid profit.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.200
I'm getting a job in Sri Lanka.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.840
I'm seriously considering it.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.920
This is the time to stay together
and you are also planning to leave me?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.280
'Also'?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.720
Pappa has already...

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.560
See, we have the brains.
You know we can do this.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.600
I had predicted the rise and fall
of all these shares.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.800
This paper-trading...

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.760
...is like watching cricket
at a corner store...

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.560
...and giving instructions
to Gavaskar.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.440
Step onto the wicket yourself,
and you're bowled.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.960
If I had the money,
I'd be no less than Gavaskar here.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.800
But we don't have the money!

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.120
Harshad <i>Bhai</i>, it's been a while.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.240
Three specials.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.840
Tea is on me today.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.080
The tip you gave me last time,
it worked wonders.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.840
By God's grace, I earned a lot.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.960
Maybe you are fed up with the market...
...but don't stop giving us tips.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.560
At least our pockets will be full!

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.640
-[Vikas] 'What say?'
- Hey, Vikas!

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.320
Coming! Give them the tea
and put it on my tab.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.440
Let's start consulting.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.840
- What?
- A consultancy firm.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.640
Are you serious?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.560
Look, we don't have money...

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.040
...and our faces aren't
going to attract any.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.440
So, let's put our brains to work.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.520
If we can turn five rupees into ten for anybody
we'll make at least 50 paise in commission.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.200
After the crash, the stock market
is a very risky place.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.560
- I don't think it's a good proposal.
- No...

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.680
That's not the stock market's fault...

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.560
...that it is like a game
of snakes and ladders.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.080
Hear me out Dhruv <i>Bhai</i>,
just this once, roll the dice...

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.480
Who knows, you might just
land on the ladder to the top!

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.920
And what if it slips again?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.000
How much lower can it slip,
Dhruv <i>Bhai</i>?

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.440
The market is at its rock-bottom.
The only way now, is up.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.160
And look, ours is a new company.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.080
We won't ruin our reputation
for the sake of pennies, will we?

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.840
That's riskier
than the market crashing.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.400
- Ashwin, tell me the truth.
- Yes.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.080
Am I the first lamb you're sacrificing?

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.160
- Buffalo.
- What?

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.720
- Singing to a buffalo.
- What do you mean?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.160
[Harshad] 'Really, Ashwin!'

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.800
What's the point of talking to someone
who is not interested in the markets?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.720
Isn't it like singing to a buffalo?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.480
Didn't I tell you? These Chartered Accountants
live in fear of the red line.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.080
He's a future client, Harshad.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.640
- How can you say such things about a client?
- What client?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.040
The buffalo isn't born yet,
and you're celebrating with buttermilk?

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.360
A client is one who invests money.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.800
But he is not interested
in making any investment.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.120
Have you managed to find
even a single client?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.520
I've found a client
who's investing 4.5 lakhs.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.440
[Ashwin] 'So, you just stay quiet.'

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.240
Dhruv <i>Bhai</i>, ignore him, he's hot-headed.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.960
Please don't let this come
in the way of our friendship.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.200
Look. It's your money, your wish.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.400
- After all, he who wields the stick, gets the buffalo.
- Hey!

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.640
Stop with the 'buffalo' sayings. Please.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.280
I haven't refused yet.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.040
One lakh.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.720
I can invest up to one lakh.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.240
[Dhruv] 'If you get me to the ladder,
we'll roll again.'

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.840
[Ashwin] 'Your buffalo sayings
could have cost us heavily!'

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.400
You are no less! You laid a
good '4.5 lakh' trap.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.120
That wasn't a trap,
we do have 4.5 lakhs.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.280
Hey! Come here.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.840
From where?

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.120
- From my in-laws.
- Meaning?

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.920
Meaning, I have spoken to Deepika's father.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.480
- Your father-in-law?
- Yes.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.880
- But...
- It was from his retirement fund.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.240
If the Goddess of wealth knocks at my door,
won't I open it?

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.400
He offered, I accepted.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.400
And who knows, my father-in-law's money
might bring us success.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.000
Right?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.360
What is success, after all?
The next chapter after failure.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.640
Well said, my Taarak Mehta!

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.120
Harshad Mehta.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.160
Ashwin Mehta.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.200
[Suresh] 'Growmore.
What does it mean?'

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.240
'Grow' means 'to progress'.
'More' means 'a lot'.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.360
Progress a lot.
Prosper a lot.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.800
English names are all the rage
these days, right?

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.120
Look at Sujata Steels.
They changed their name to Stallion Steels...

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.600
...and in 2 months, their price rose
from seven to twelve rupees.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.320
People tend to trust
English names more, isn't it?

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.120
Well, I've settled the accounts.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.680
We owe you a little more...
We'll return it soon.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.240
There is no need to worry.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.680
So tell me,
what are your future plans?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.840
You have some investors, right?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.480
What I mean is...

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.960
...to invest,
you'd need a broker, right?

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.120
That's right.
We'll become sub-brokers somewhere.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.760
Somewhere? Why not here?

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.160
But you've suspended
our trading account, right?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.800
So obviously we can't be sub-brokers here.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.960
Your trading account resumes today.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.280
Don't think too much.
Today is an auspicious day.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.800
Okay. From today,
I make you my sub-broker.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.400
Anything else?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.120
So...

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.280
What's your address?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.960
Where do I visit you
for a cup of tea?

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.560
I have eight offices in this building...

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.520
But you are very lucky...

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.480
...that your father's old
office is available.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.480
I know it looks a bit messy.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.200
But, I'll get it cleaned
and it'll be spanking new.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.440
What's the rent?

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.520
[Landlord] 'The previous tenant
used to pay 250 rupees.'

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.400
'You're like family. It's negotiable.'

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.560
What's important is that
all textile traders have offices here...

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.880
You can get everything you need.
Buttons, thread, needles...

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.640
Our business is not textiles.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.280
But your father...

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.520
...he did run a textile business then...

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.360
...but we are in the share market.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.760
Harshad, he is quoting 500 rupees rent
and a deposit of 5000.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.320
Whatever it is, let's take it.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.120
Are you sure?

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.160
Why did you have to move
into that same office?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.640
That office has given us nothing.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.800
In fact, it took away everything we had.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.960
- Please don't worry...
- Why shouldn't I worry?

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.280
- What is it called? Bad...
- Bad luck.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.800
- Right?
- Yes.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.880
Nothing will go wrong.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.720
All traders there
are minting money.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.040
Here, read this paper.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.240
- I don't want to.
- What's your zodiac? Aren't you an Aries...

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.440
Hey! Where did you go
early in the morning?

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.960
Fact-finding.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.560
- Research.
- Research? Researching tea?

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.960
Are we starting a tea stall now?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.960
- Mummy, get me a cup of tea please?
- Yes.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.760
We should invest in tea.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.360
Hey! Just because a tea seller
increased the price by 50 paise...

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.480
...now you think the stock market
will boom because of this?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.240
I'm not talking about loose change.
I've just spoken to Harish, the one from Kenya.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.600
So?

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.240
Do you know which country
produces the most tea in the world?

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.440
- China.
- Rubbish!

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.040
- Why?
- It's Africa.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.080
More than thirty percent of
the world's tea is produced in Africa.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.760
Sri Lanka is in second position
and India comes fourth.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.960
That's good to know
but how does it matter to us?

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.440
It matters a lot, brother.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.120
<i>Mavtho</i> has changed
the whole game this year.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.320
What's <i>Mavtho</i>?

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.760
Unseasonal rainfall.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.320
This has dropped tea production
in Africa considerably.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.240
Is it?

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.080
- Now they won't be able to meet the demand.
- Correct.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.520
So, who is going to benefit from it?
Uhh...

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.920
- India.
- Yes, right.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.400
Look at this, Indian tea exports
are about to double this year.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.880
- So, the profits too will double.
- Double.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.440
- So, let's invest big in Tata Tea.
- There are other companies too.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.120
There's Harrisons Malayalam...
McLeod Russell.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.880
McLeod pays a 20 percent
dividend every year.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.240
But its share price is only 14 rupees.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.320
If we invest in it,
we're sure to make a profit.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.520
So, what's your speed?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.960
Sir, I can type
80 words per minute.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.160
Okay.
Do you own a typewriter?

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.800
No, sir. You will have to
give me a typewriter.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.760
No, no...

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.680
If you want to work here,
you'll have to get your own typewriter.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.840
I can type in Hindi, English,
Gujarati and Marathi.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.240
Yes, Rebello, sit down.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.800
Rebello, what's your typing speed?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.320
- Forty.
- Just forty?

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.600
- Yes, sir.
- I write faster than that by hand.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.160
But I will improve, sir.
I practice every day.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.080
- Where?
- At home.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.640
- Do you own a typewriter?
- Yes.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.920
[Harshad] 'Dear Mr. Rawal...'

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.720
'...we at Growmore Consultants
would like to invite you...'

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.760
'...to open a trading account
with us.'

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.760
'Here we can park your surplus money
into the stock markets...'

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.760
'...under our
portfolio management scheme.'

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.960
'Our business strategy rests
on the belief...'

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.680
'...that we can provide you
with good service and higher returns.'

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.480
'Yours truly,
Harshad Mehta for Growmore.'

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.280
[Rahil] 'What're you even saying?'

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.960
I told you, this would go past my head.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.480
See? I was right.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.080
I don't understand.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.160
How can I sell shares
that I don't have?

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.360
- It's called selling short.
- That may be so.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.800
- But how is it done?
- Look, you don't have the shares...

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.960
...but the broker who handles your
trading account has plenty shares.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.200
Let's assume...
Reliance is 100 rupees today...

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.440
...and you think it might drop.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.560
So you ask your broker to sell 10 shares
on your behalf, for 100 rupees each.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.600
So he sells 10 shares for 100 rupees each.
How much does he make?

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320
A thousand rupees.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.520
Will that 1000 be mine?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.400
Not yet. It's not so easy.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.600
- First, you have to replace the shares
that he sold for you, correct? - Yes.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.640
And this settlement cycle lasts 14 days
in the share market.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.480
Now in these 14 days,
the share price can fluctuate.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.680
It could go to 110, 120, 80, 90, etcetera.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.880
Now say, the day the share value is at 80...

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.520
...you ask your broker
to buy ten shares for you...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.480
...how much does he pay for them?

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.440
- 800?
- Yes.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.520
This is called 'squaring off a transaction'.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.280
Sold for 1000, bought back at 800,
what's the profit?

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.960
200? A profit of 200?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.320
Not entirely,
some is deducted as commission.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.640
The rest is yours.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.360
This is like betting in cricket, isn't it?

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.440
You bet on the losing team,
the team loses and you make a profit.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.280
But what if the team wins?

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.360
What if the share price goes up?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.320
But if you know the team's history...

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.280
...the player's record,
the condition of the pitch...

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.480
...then it's not betting.
It's a calculated prediction.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.560
Are you sure about this?

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.360
Trust Harshad's sharp business sense.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.760
It slices past the best of them.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.360
[Pranav] 'Plain papadum,
pickled papadum.'

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.360
'Plain papadum, pickled papad...'
Plain meaning... family and friends..

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.120
And pickled?
The contacts you add outside.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.320
In six months, all you have are
a few home-grown clients...

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.360
...and not a single pickled one
from elsewhere.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.440
How far will you go like this?

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.760
Pranav <i>Bhai</i>, I am not interested
in rolling papadums.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.560
I want to directly fry and eat them
with a tomato-onion garnish.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.280
Are you asking for corporate clients now?

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.720
You can surely get me a few.
You're well-versed with the corporate world now.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.840
Don't even think about it,
Corporate clients won't come here.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.280
But there are a few wealthy birds.
We can spread some Seed for them.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.040
But hey! They won't grace
this pigeonhole of yours.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.760
Your poverty will
trouble their rich souls.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.440
Okay. I'll do whatever you say.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.360
How well does English roll off your tongue?

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.320
My company is relatively new.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.040
But I have a fresh approach
towards the market.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.560
I've been consistently delivering
37 percent profit...

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.920
...to all my clients
for the last 10 months.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.560
Have a look.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.160
But the base capital is quite low.
How does the profit matter?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.960
Sir, look at it this way.
The glass is half full.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.800
Have you ever seen a return
of 14 rupees on an investment of 10?

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.280
Before you know it, ten lakhs
will turn into 14.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.120
I can serve you pure profit on a platter.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.920
Share market isn't Ali Baba's cave, is it?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.960
You'll say 'Open Sesame'
and the door to the treasure will open?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.600
You're absolutely right.
This is neither a cave nor is it magic.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.920
And that's the very perception
we have to change.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.160
See, it's all about research
and analysis.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.560
We conduct proper research and analysis,
and only then we invest your money in the market.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.200
What kind of research?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.800
By research I mean, the company's balance sheet,
its future plans...

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.480
...and some crucial confidential
information that only a few know about.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.400
To cut a long story short...

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.200
Last month... Easy, be careful.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.040
What if I had told you a month back...

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.760
...to bet on the Indian cricket team
because it's going to win the World Cup.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.800
Would you have done it?

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.080
But now look, India has won the World Cup.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.960
Now think about this. The ones
who did bet on India...

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.520
What a fortune they must have made!

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.960
Remember one thing. Harshad...

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.560
...is the Kapil Dev of BSE.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.440
Don't think too much. Let's drink to this.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.960
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.000
Come here.
I need to talk to you.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.560
Carry on gentlemen.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.920
I couldn't bear it any longer,
so I jumped in. Sorry.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.120
Now my Ali Baba, go keep your
40 thieves engaged with money...

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.560
I'll go get my honey...

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.680
Darling, I hate tears
But I love cheers!

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.600
Yeah!

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.560
Come, come...

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.480
Gentlemen, meet my butterflies.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.120
Butterflies, meet your bumblebees.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.800
Why are you tightening your trousers?
It's time to loosen them now.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.640
Hey!

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.680
He's completely useless.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.120
You're a fool!

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.040
You've become a workhorse.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.680
Be smarter!

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.320
When did you leave the party?

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.960
- Didn't I tell you before leaving?
- That early?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.400
- I'm a family man, I can't do this.
- Huh?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.240
Yes, we have families.
We can't do this.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.480
Hey, family <i>wallahs</i>!
All those were also family men.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.360
Ashwin, this is how you run a business.
You will earn money only if you mingle.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.160
Four of them were ready
to invest ten lakhs, but him...

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.480
- Family man.
- Just four?

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.560
Didn't you say there were 40 people?

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.760
-[Pranav] 'How does it matter?'
- Look at this.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.360
Open Sesame.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.880
What is it?

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.840
"Govardhan."

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.840
"Gordhandas."

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.680
"Manilal."

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960
"Vasant."

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.120
Vasant gave you money?!

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.640
Ali Baba and thieves galore,
Harshad and Growmore.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.120
Give me a high five.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.520
Ms. Dalal, do you know...

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.360
...how many floors there are
in the Bombay Stock Exchange?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.480
Twenty-eight.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.760
Running between these 28 floors
and gathering...

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.640
...every bit of information every day
could be your job.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.960
Does it still sound exciting?

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.960
Yes. Yes, it does.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.920
Also, I run around a lot in my current job
so that shouldn't be a problem at all.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.120
Ms. Dalal, I really want to know this.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.640
Why do you want to take up a career
in something where there are no women?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.040
Should that really matter, sir?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.880
I mean, let's look at the big picture.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.920
The more stereotypes we break,
the more society benefits.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.640
Sir, I just want to be a great journalist.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.000
And to answer your question,
if that makes me...

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120
...the first female financial journalist...

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.120
...then it's all the more reason
for me to work hard and excel.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.200
The fact that
it's a lesser-travelled road...

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.200
...that, that doesn't bother me.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.240
Well, lesser-travelled roads would
also mean less salary.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.720
We can't even pay you half of what
you are getting in your current hotel job.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.320
Well, if I am working
in the finance sector...

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.120
...I will at least need enough
to manage my own finances.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.800
And, how much would that be?

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.640
Uhm...

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.200
You guys make such pathetic tea...

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.200
...that even the biscuit shies away.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.680
If you are going to serve cold tea...

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.920
...then why do you boil
the tea leaves till they burn?

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.840
Who makes this tea?

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.520
Wait a minute.
Let me tell you how tea is made.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.520
First, boil some water
without tea leaves.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:51.520
Add some cardamom,
some ginger and some <i>lobongo</i>.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.240
- What's that?
- Cloves...

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.000
- Then say that.
- Okay, my master. Cloves.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.040
Once the water boils,
add the tea leaves.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.360
Don't boil the tea leaves to death. Okay?

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.840
Then add a little milk. Simple.
Tea is ready.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.680
- And when do we add sugar?
- At the end.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.080
Did you get it? Now give this
to the one who makes tea.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.640
Keep it with you, sir.
He doesn't know to read.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.840
I will explain it to him.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960
Hello, take this with you!

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.520
- Debashis?
- Sir.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.920
This is Sucheta Dalal.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.920
Oh, yes, sir. You told me.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.160
Show her the Bombay Stock Exchange,
yeah?

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.320
Sure sir.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.720
- All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720
To your left, is the SBI.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.960
People save money there
and lose it here at the BSE.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.560
Okay. Here we are.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.440
By the way, Bombay's
best sandwiches are sold here.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.160
And with that, mint <i>chutney</i>
and market-gossip for free.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.360
Come.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.400
- First, we'll meet Agarwal sir
and then the rest. - Okay.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.240
- Hey, Jignesh <i>Bhai</i>.
- Debashis <i>Bhai</i>.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.880
- Debashis <i>Bhai</i>, the market is rocking today!
- Is it?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.960
The index went through the roof of BSE.
We will make a solid profit today.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.640
Look, in the pursuit of profit,
don't forget your newspaper article, Jignesh <i>Bhai</i>.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.360
And when will you get me those
special sweets from Surat?

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.440
Just say the word, boss.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.680
I'll call for them by
the morning train.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.160
- Anything else?
- Please, thank you.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.440
- Okay, then. Bye.
- Bye.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.920
That's the financial reporter
of Ahmedabad Samachar. Jignesh.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.040
What happened?
What are you looking at?

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.760
Oh, okay! Come.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:46.720
Look, neither reporters nor financial
newspapers... can survive at 1200 to 1500 rupees

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.400
This is how the system works.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.240
They all eat, sleep
and shit together with the traders.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.880
They get so much insider news that
in a few years, everyone is well-settled.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.120
- Do you trade too?
- No... I don't have patience.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.800
Trades are always like
watching paint dry or grass grow.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.360
I would
rather invest in diamonds.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.280
So, what's a diamond guy
doing in Dalal street?

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.040
- All my sources are here.
- Ah.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.920
Come.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.560
We went too deep into Blowcast.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.400
We had invested the right amount
at the right time.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.720
The entire market is on a high.
But we're screwed.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.720
Let it be.
What's gone is gone.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.720
Look, if we have to do this,
we can't do it by ourselves.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.280
We need staff. We need someone
who has some experience.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.040
Someone who knows to play the ring...

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.960
...and who can also handle
the back office and accounts.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.520
In short, we need
a team player, brother.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.640
I know one such all-rounder.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.240
Are you on drugs
or do you take me for a fool?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.360
You are asking me to quit
my job with Ambalal <i>saheb</i>...

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.680
...and work for you at a lesser pay?

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.400
You enjoy working for peanuts?

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.600
Forget salary and commission.
Concentrate on the profit.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.840
The share market is a deep well...

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.160
...that can quench the entire nation's
thirst for money.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.600
And I want to dive into this well.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.280
I want to go very deep.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.040
Look, I want to create history.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.680
And history is not easy to make.
It needs the conviction and support of people.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.680
I want to build an army of a 100...
who are willing to give me their 100 percent.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.600
Then I'm a thousand and one per cent sure
that we'll create history.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.400
There can only be one commander to my army.
Bhushan Bhatt.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.080
We are old partners.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.240
Are you offering me a partnership?

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.360
Take whatever you want.
The company is yours.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.440
But first, accept my offer
and join hands with me.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.440
[Sucheta] <i>'While I was busy
understanding the world of the share market...'</i>

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.640
<i>'...Harshad was busy making
the share market his world.'</i>

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.680
<i>'He was playing the game,
I was still learning it.'</i>

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.400
<i>'Slowly but surely, his horizons
began to widen.'</i>

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.400
<i>'Now, more than just one game,
he was looking at the whole playing field.'</i>

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:23.400
<i>'Soon, his dreams would outgrow the ring.'</i>

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.600
<i>'But in this ring, there was a ringmaster.
Black Cobra. That is, Manu Mundra.'</i>

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.880
<i>'The market danced
to Manu <i>Bhai</i>'s tunes.'</i>

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.360
<i>'Even the biggest companies in India
feared Mundra's decisions.'</i>

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.680
<i>'And in the market,
there was one mongoose...</i>

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.560
<i>...who could take on the cobra.'</i>

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.280
Okay, I'll do it. Okay.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.400
Harshad, it was Jignesh on the phone.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.840
A broker's membership card is being auctioned.
What do you say?

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.760
What's there to say. Go ahead.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.680
I've already spoken to
Parekh <i>Bhai</i> for sponsorship.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.120
- The money will be arranged.
- Good.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.200
Tea.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.840
The people from Kesari Tours had called.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.680
Let's go to Shimla in December?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.640
Did you hear what mummy said?

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.640
She wants to go to Shimla in December.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.840
Tell her she will freeze!

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.480
Duffer, in December people come
from all over to see the snowfall.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.160
- December is the right time.
- Right?

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.840
- Yeah.
- Even the cost is reasonable.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.680
And they also have a vegetarian cook.
So, we can have Gujarati food.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.720
That's great. Then we'll have
<i>Shrikhand-Poori</i> all the way.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.560
Ask them to send the details.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.560
Go, turn on the radio.
It's time for Pappa's news. Go.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.040

How long will this pilot last?
What do you think, Maheshwari?

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.080
Till December at best.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.280
He won't be there
beyond the elections.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.040
People don't believe that
this pilot will take off.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.160
And I think the time is ripe...

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.720
...to square off all the bull trades...

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.880
...and take positions in the market.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.680
Let's f*****g break the market.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.440
<i>Bhai</i> Ashwin, pull out all you can
from the market.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.520
It's a nosedive.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.280
Soon the index will be in the dust.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.560
Let's allow it to recover a little.
Then we'll sell.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.920
- What do you say, Harshad?
-[Pranav] 'What do you think?'

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.520
This is not
the economy class of an airplane.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.600
The nation's economy is in his hands now.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.600
And soon, we will be
roaming the market with begging bowls.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.200
Harshad, are you even listening?

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.040
If I say what I want,
you'll get a headache.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.760
- Still want to hear it?
- Okay.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.200
I'm all ears.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.840
The <i>masala</i> of the market is created
from four spices.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.080
- <i>Masala</i>?
- Yes.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.480
Firstly, tip.
Or information, insider trading, research.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.640
Now add some risk to it.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.640
Higher the risk, spicier the market.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.440
Grind some passion into this mixture.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.760
- What kind of passion?
-[Harshad] 'Emotion.'

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.640
As the trade pundits say,
"Understand the sentiment of the market".

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.960
So, understand the emotion.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.080
And now add a pinch of luck. There you go.
The market's <i>masala</i> is ready.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.880
Is he trading or cooking?
Ashwin?

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.760
Pranav <i>Bhai</i>, your <i>masala</i> is too
heavy on emotions.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.080
And man always makes mistakes
when he is emotional.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.040
This is the time to
add a tempering of risk.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.320
This is not the time to sell.
It's the time to buy.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.960
The lower these bears pull the market...

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.880
...the higher it will bounce.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.360
It will rebound. Look at this.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.000
This pilot is going to fly high.
And so are we.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.960
Pranav <i>Bhai</i>, I rarely agree with Harshad.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.520
But today is one such day.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.240
This is exactly the problem
with you Bulls.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.360
A Bull kills you with hope.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.960
And a Bear kills you with fear.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.040
Look at this. Read this paragraph.
Look.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.800
Indrol, Zuari Agro, SPIC.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.680
Do you know how cheap they are?

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.040
Once they surge,
there will be no stopping them.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.120
Are you crazy?
The country is up in flames.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.600
People aren't driving cars.
They're burning them.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.840
And at a time like this,
you want to invest in oil, in petroleum?

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.800
My friend. You need petrol either way.
Whether it is to drive a car, or to burn it.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.400
Forget the sentimental value.
Look at the real value, darling.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.560
Yes, brother. This is confirmed news.
Indrol will drown today.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.320
Who's screwing with Indrol?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.960
Cobra! Cobra!

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.960
He's short on Indrol.
It will crash today for sure.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.920
But we've taken a rather
long position on it.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:05.360
So what, brother?
The Cobra's tail is longer.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.040
[Bhushan] <i>'Trust me, let it go, we can bear
a little loss.'</i>

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.400
But we don't have the cash to
hold our position.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.920
We'll catch this bloody Cobra
by his long tail!

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.560
He'll be gone for a long time.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.440
- Let's ask all our clients to buy instead.
-Huh?!

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.320
Tell all our clients to buy Indrol.
Buy as much as possible. Everything.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.440
Buy Indrol, everyone.
Buy as much as possible.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.560
- Hey, Sachin <i>Bhau</i>...
- Hello, Siddesh<i>ji</i>. How're you?

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.480
I have good news for you.
Vaghji <i>Bhai</i>, having fun?

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.400
Hello, Victor <i>Anna</i>. How're you?

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.960
Greetings, Anand Kumarji.
How're you doing?

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.160
Rahil, what's up? It's a great day
for investment.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.800
Buy all the shares today.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.400
This is the time
for a guaranteed profit.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.480
No... I guarantee you.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.400
This is a good day to invest.
Trust me.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.720
That's great.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.120
It's Harshad's guarantee.
Don't worry.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.800
You wanted to invest
a big amount, right?

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.080
Come on, spend some more!

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.240
It's a great opportunity
to sweep up these shares.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.840
This is the smoothest time.
This share will make you rich.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.040
If you agree, we can hit
a sixer on this one.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.720
Yes. Okay, thank you.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.640
What?

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.120
Sure. Okay, thank you.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.640
I'm glad we sold off Indrol
this morning.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.440
Shall we square off the positions
and book our profit?

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.640
- What say, Raju?
- No. Let's hold the position.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.480
Indrol will drop further.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.640
Listen, come here.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.800
Buy Indrol. Tell everyone.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.560
Indrol! Indrol! Indrol!

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.000
I've to go to the washroom.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.240
In trying to hold our positions,
we've incurred a serious loss.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.160
We were all set.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.480
-[phone rings]
- Suddenly, just as short covering began...

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.720
...it started rising.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.080
One minute. Yes?

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.240
Later.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.800
Who's pushing it up?

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.960
Manu <i>Bhai</i>, at the last moment,
the buying orders...

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.680
Raju! Don't talk like an ass.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.320
Where are the buying orders coming from?
LIC? UTI? Ambani?

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.840
- Who's buying it?
- We can't say for sure.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.440
But that Harshad... he was in good mood.
He's buying a lot nowadays.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.040
Harshad? Who?
That f****r Harshad Mehta?

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.480
Yes, Manu <i>Bhai</i>.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.200
He's giving 60 to 70 percent
returns to his investors.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.800
- And who's funding him?
- It isn't just one source.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.680
They're all are genuine investors.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.360
Hey, Maheshwari...

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.960
[phone ringing]

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.040
[Manu Manek] 'Hold on for a minute.'

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.040
In this market of ours,
there are no genuine investors...

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.920
...Everyone is an opportunist.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.080
And that a*****e you are
talking about... what's his name?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.640
- Harshad Mehta.
-[Manu] 'Harshad Mehta.'

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.080
When the time comes,
we'll make sure he falls too.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.040
Is he a Tata? Is he an Ambani?
Who's he?

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.320
Maheshwari...

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.760
...targeting the stock will only...
M**********r!

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.960
Pramod?
Why did you get me tea in a steel cup?

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.040
M**********r!

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.560
Targeting the stock will only shake him,
not break him.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.840
He might pause. But he won't bend.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.760
If there's one thing we want to target...
It's not the stock. It's his reputation.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.960
Maheshwari, when you can't tarnish
someone's work, tarnish their name.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.200
The worse his reputation,
The lesser people will trust him.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.640
And without trust,
there won't be any investment.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.520
Without investment,
Consider the bull's balls cut forever.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.680
It'll never rise again.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.120
So let's do one thing.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.440
Let's create a perception about Harshad
among his investors.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.600
What perception?

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.240
That Harshad has lost
60-70 lakhs in SPIC.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.840
No... More than one crore.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.080
The number must be huge.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.040
That's when traders will
start selling the stocks he holds.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.800
And once traders start selling...

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.320
It's a free fall. Yes!

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.080
The bull will be sacrificed this time.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.960
- What's up Harshad <i>Bhai</i>?
- Welcome.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.120
What's up, Jignesh <i>Bhai</i>?

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.440
Ahmedabad Samachar at my doorstep
delivering news personally!

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.640
- How did you know?
- Nothing is secret for a reporter.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.080
You know everything about everything.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.200
Tell me. What are the headlines?

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.840
Manu <i>Bhai</i>'s people are planning to
throw your reputation to the wind.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.240
Of course, they will.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.400
Now that he's pulled SPIC so low,
it's obvious he will celebrate a little.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.120
Let him.
We will turn the tide in no time.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.840
Manu <i>Bhai</i>'s people are going to
further target SPIC tomorrow.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.920
Is that it or you have some more news?

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.200
The inside news in the market is that you won't
be able to square up with the exchange.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.320
Jignesh <i>Bhai</i>, that's not inside news.
This is called a rumour.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.920
We have a margin of one crore
with BSE.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.120
We can easily cover the loss.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.120
Are people so gullible?
That they will blindly believe Manu <i>Bhai</i>?

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.640
Today, Manu <i>Bhai</i>'s lies
are taken as the gospel truth.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.800
Think about it. I'll be off.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.320
- Stay. Have some tea.
- Next time.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.880
I have more news to deliver.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.600
I'm not afraid of Manu <i>Bhai</i>.
He's not that powerful.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.120
While the rich sleep in chambers of gold...

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.880
...the poor stay up all night in the cold.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.520
What are you saying?
Speak in a language I understand.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.440
Look, <i>Bhai</i>.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.360
We don't need to fear Manu <i>Bhai</i>.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.440
We need to be afraid of the people
who believe in Manu <i>Bhai</i>.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.800
Those who are worried
of becoming poor overnight.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.680
Manu <i>Bhai</i> cannot destroy us.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.920
But those weak people who lose their
sleep over this rumour, can destroy us.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.400
Brother, I suggest we must pull back
as much as we can, as soon as we can.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.440
We are the target. They'll try to break
every position that we're holding.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.640
Bhushan, what you're saying
is not that easy.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.680
Harshad, we need to think of something.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.520
He is after our reputation, right?

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.360
[Harshad] 'There's only one way of saving it.'

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.040
'We have to clear all our dues.'

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.760
'Let's prepare cheques to
clear all payments.'

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.600
'And alongside, a letter that says...'

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.760
'...Forget default, Growmore is clearing off
its dues 14 days in advance.'

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.520
And before the market opens,
let's meet Mayya <i>Bhai</i>.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.720
'When the executive director of BSE
announces that this is all just a rumour...'

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.360
'...everyone's ears will perk up.'

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.680
'All the payment cheques are ready
with signature.'

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.880
The settlement period is of 14 days.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.080
Why are you clearing the payments so early?

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.520
Because it's a matter of reputation.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.240
We know...

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.240
...that normally people carry forward
the trade till the next settlement...

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.600
...and then go looking for funds.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.800
But some people in BSE
are spreading rumours...

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.720
...that Growmore has no funds...

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.680
...and that we would default
on our payments.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.400
That's why I'm clearing all the dues
in advance.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.160
So that it becomes clear to all
that Growmore is in no shortage of funds.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.400
Mayya<i>ji</i>, please put up a notice...

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.840
...saying "Everything is fine at Growmore".

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.960
Because, if the people spreading these rumours
don't shut up...

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.960
...then more than Harshad Mehta,
this will affect the market.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.640
I can't put up a notice.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.240
But don't worry.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.080
I will tell the board that
Growmore has paid all its dues in advance.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.880
And as far as the market goes...

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.440
Don't worry about that.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.040
The market is quite
shaken up after the budget.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.160
And we won't let anyone
manipulate the market so easily, will we?

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.960
Whoever that may be.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.560
<i>Bhai</i>, I will call Jignesh right away.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.680
This news should be
in every financial column tomorrow.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.680
It won't be of any use
if it's published tomorrow.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.360
This news must reach people
before the market opens today.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.240
If required, we'll scream from the rooftops
that we have made the payment.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.840

'...from Wafadar Tea House to the sandwich stall,
from the lunch home to Irani Cafe.'

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.160
Spread this news like wildfire...

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.040
...that Mehta has made
the payment.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.640
Don't take money from anyone.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.120
Tell everyone that
tea is on Harshad Mehta today.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.080
He's the Bachchan of BSE.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.680
Who doesn't know him?

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.320
BSE means Harshad Mehta.
Look at that.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.880
Free? What's the occasion?

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.600
Everyone was saying
that Harshad <i>Bhai</i> is bankrupt.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.920
But he's cleared
everyone's payments in advance.

- Yes.

'In Mehta's reign, the market will go insane.'

the settlement period, if he wanted.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.000
But he didn't.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:34.640
He incurred such a huge personal loss
for the sake of his reputation.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.320
Everyone is saying,
'In Mehta's reign, the market will go insane.'

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.440
Insane?

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.000
Don't talk like a fool.
