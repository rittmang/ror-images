[Sucheta] <i>'In the crash of 1986,
Harshad had managed to save his reputation.'</i>

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.440
<i>'But he had begun to realise...'</i>

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.840
<i>'...that dipping into one's own pocket,
was not the way to run a large-scale business.'</i>

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600
<i>'To scale up, he needed big funds...'</i>

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.160
<i>'...and Harshad started knocking at the
door of financial institutions...'</i>

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.520
<i>'And there was only one man who could open
this door completely.'</i>

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.600
<i>'The Chairman of the Unit Trust of India,
M. J. Pherwani.'</i>

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.920
<i>'The original Big Bull.'</i>

<i>'Before the advent of mutual funds
and private investments...'</i>

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.240
<i>'...there were only two places where
Indian taxpayers could safely invest their money.'</i>

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.000
<i>'LIC and UTI.'</i>

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.600
<i>'While LIC was a long-term
institutional investor...'</i>

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.080
<i>'...UTI had a corpus fund of 20,000 crores
to invest in the share market.'</i>

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.240
<i>'If UTI decided to buy,
the Sensex was sure to gallop ahead.'</i>

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.600

the Sensex would get reigned in.'</i>

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.760
- Please.
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440
I've been wanting to meet you both
for a while now.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.800
- Glad to meet you.
- Same here, sir.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.400
Before we talk business...

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.680
...I want to ask you guys
a very important question.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.320
Please.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.840
Do you know what is the most
valuable thing in the world?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.360
Uhh...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.480
It's not a watch.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.120
Not even expensive scotch.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.400
Not even those big cars, diamonds...

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.720
No. Nothing.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.920
- Advice?
- Uh...

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240
You know... sometimes a piece of
advice can change your life...?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.600
Let me give you a hint.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800
That word is a part
of my company's name.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.880
- Trust?
- Correct. Trust.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.200
Do you know why trust is so valuable?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400
Because it's in great demand.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.800
And is always in short supply.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.960
Very true.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.480
Now the question is,
why should I trust you? Why?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.960
Well, you can very well trust us.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.560
- In fact, our entire business is...
- Precisely 13 months and 10 days ago...

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.120
...a few of my Vam Organics shares
landed up in someone's hands.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.440
Owing to a simple
clerical mistake.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.560
[Pherwani] 'My office tried
to contact them.'

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.040
But, do you know what they did?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.240
They used this clerical mistake to their advantage
and sold those shares.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.440
- Sir, that...
- You sold those shares.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.240
- Those shares had landed up with you.
- Sir, actually, what happened was...

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.200
There is some big misunderstanding.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.920
None of your shares ever came to us.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.840
- And even if they did, how could we have sold them?
- Stop! Please, stop.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.120
Don't try to teach me
how our system functions.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.360
Do you know
why I wanted to meet you guys?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.600
Because I wanted to tell you...

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.760
...there could be
a loophole in the system.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.960
But only a few people misuse it.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.160
People like you.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.560
I don't do business just
for the sake of a deal.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360
I do business with people
whom I can trust.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.800
No trust...

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.800
...no business.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.360
[Title Montage]

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.960
<i>Somras.</i> Do you know
why this is called the drink of the Gods?

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.960
Because drinking it on Sunday,
makes Monday feel like heaven.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.960
Have a sip. You won't get addicted
with a sip. Come on.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.960
No, thank you.
I'm okay with my Thums Up.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.960
Okay?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.160
My Cheetah...

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.280
...in the past six months, you've bagged
LIC, GIC, Can Mutual...

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.080
...and pocketed 1.5 per cent commission
in every deal.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.280
My institutional broker, huh?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.000
- What, Pranav <i>Bhai</i>?
- And you say you're "okay"?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.280
Hardly an institutional broker.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.080
UTI still hasn't given us any business.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.920
And I'm tired of this 1.5 per cent game.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.040
Institutions have so much money
but no plan.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.960
To be honest, if I had that kind of money...

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.080
...the market would have been
up by 4,000 points.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.400
Then take it up. It's your money,
go on and invest it.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.960
What's that you say?
"Risk is the spice of life", right?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.200
Darling, whiskey is risky too.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.840
Have a taste of this spice too.
Come on...

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.320
You are impossible.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.960
Hey, Pranav Sheth, your laughter can be
heard from a mile away.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.320
Ajay <i>Bhai</i>!

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.400
Wonderful. I'm glad you
were just a mile away...

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.960
...coz my laughter can't reach
all the way to Calcutta.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.880
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.480
-[Man] 'Pranav!'
- Yes?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.360
You can't drink,
but you can hold it, right? Here.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.760
Go on, pay your respects. Big man.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.040
Stay right here.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.400
[Pranav] 'Hey, how're you?'

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.320
Ajay <i>Bhai</i>, Harshad.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.160
- Harshad Mehta.
- Ajay Kedia. Cheers.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.080
Oh no no.
This is Pranav <i>Bhai</i>'s.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.800
I don't drink. By the way,
I've heard a lot about you.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.880
Ever since I've entered the market,
I've heard of Mr. Kedia from Calcutta.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.320
That Black Thursday crash of 1982...?

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.040
...your's and Reliance's...?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.320
I too lost lakhs that day.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.360
I mean, I was on the verge
of packing up from the market. Bag and baggage.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.600
Harish, right?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.280
- Harshad. Harshad Mehta.
- Yes, Harshad.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.720
A word of advice for you Harshad.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.440
If you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen. Huh?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.760
It's not like that.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.200
And I'm really sorry if we ended
your stint in the market.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.400
- Hmmm? Very sorry about that.
- No, no...

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.600
In fact, I've started
my own consultancy now.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.200
- Yours?
- Yes...

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.280
Growmore.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.120
Alright, Mr. Growmore.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.520
I will see you around...

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.160
...if you stay around.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.240
Come here.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.960
Oh, Mr. Mehta?
Where's my drink?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.440
Bloody hell!

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.080
You finished my drink?

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.920
[Pranav laughs]

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.760
Who the hell is this Kedia?

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.520
What's with his attitude?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.160
Of course he has an attitude.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.520
He practically owns the share market.
He comes from a family of traders.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.920
He manages four companies simultaneously.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.920
One foot in the money market
and the other in the share market.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.840
[Pranav] 'Government securities, PSU bonds...
At a huge scale. '

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.440
Money market?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.520
Is there so much money to be
made in government securities?

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.520
It's the <i>bazaar</i> of wealth, brother!

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.600
Okay, tell me one thing. What is
the daily volume of our share market?

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.880
Around 10,000 crores...

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.400
And guess the daily volume of the money market?
Two lakh crores.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.040
Therefore, attitude.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.320
Ashwin, have you ever seen a cricketer
play tennis?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.840
But even in tennis, there is a grass court, a clay court...
and the game is different for each.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640
This money market game is out of your league.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.720
[Ashwin] 'Harshad, it's all been
going well for six months.'

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.720
- Now why this new obsession?
- What's been going well?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200
Growmore is just our name,
where's the growth?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.440
Institutional broking is not good enough.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.760
We have to think of something new.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.200
Businesses reach saturation points, not brains.
Or do we stop using our brains as well?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.840
I get it.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.200
That Ajay Kedia, he's rattled you, right?

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.400
[Pranav] 'And so,
you're lecturing us now.'

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.240
'Why don't you speak clearly...'

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.280
...that you want to stick a finger
up his, for the way he treated you?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.240
[Ashwin] 'Does anyone here even
know what the money market is?'

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.480
Do you have
any solid plan in mind?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.880
Now that's the right question.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.160
Look, the share market and
money market aren't very different.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.800
Here, instead of shares,
we trade in...

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.120
...government securities, PSU bonds
and units.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.680
We all know that a broker understands
a company's share's value...

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.680
...better than the company itself,
right?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.720
Yes.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.400
Similarly, in the money market...

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.000
...which banks want to buy securities
and where they can get them...

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.760
...is in the broker's knowledge.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.640
[Harshad] 'Our job is to manage both
demand and supply.'

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.720
The most important document in every
money market transaction is the SGL note.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.840
SGL means Subsidiary General Ledger.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.720
[Ashwin] 'Now let's assume, I buy
1000 units from you.'

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.680
'So, you give me an SGL note
in return.'

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.360
'I deposit this SGL
in the PDO...'

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.880
'...that is Public Debt Office of the RBI.'

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.800
'The PDO holds the account
for all your units.'

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.960
[Harshad] 'Brokers, banks...
everyone wants their business to grow fast.'

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.400
'And they say, SGLs slow down transactions.'

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.080
So, instead of SGL, we will use BR.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.240
-[Bhushan] 'BR... meaning Bank Receipt.'
-[Rebello] 'Hmm...'

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.400
'That means transactions
are now possible without SGL.'

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.920
'There is no central authority.'

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.400
'Now, when one bank wants to sell
its securities to another...'

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.760
'...they can simply issue a receipt...'

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.360
'...guaranteeing that they
have the securities.'

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.840
[Ashwin] 'Do we have a contact
in Citibank?'

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.040
[Harshad] 'We don't have a contact
but I've fixed a meeting with K S Tyagi...'

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.280
'...he handles all their
money market deals.'

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.160
'He's known as 'Tyagu' in the market'

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.080
Mr. Mehta, it's not important
whether you're capable or not.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.480
What is important is whether
you understand this market.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.680
First, learn about this market
and then approach us.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.520
Then we'll see.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.760
You mean to say, you won't do business
with us because we are outsiders?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.880
It's not a question of insider
or outsider.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.240
I already have
my existing set of brokers.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.880
Why should I work with somebody new?

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.280
Sir, there was a time, I was new
at the stock markets too.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.840
But I found my way through it.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.200
So, I am sure I can do it
with money markets too.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.640
Mr. Mehta, let me give you some
very good advice.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.200
This is the money market.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.160
Top brokers from the stock market
want to enter it, but they can't.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.440
You know why?
Because of pedigree.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.040
Pedigree is very important here.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.000
[Tyagi] 'There's no place
for new people in this market.'

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.400
You shouldn't try either.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.800
Thank you for your advice, sir.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.920
But I am not sure if it was
in my interest or yours.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.960
Have a good day.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.880
Hi.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.440
Who's that?

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.000
Ajay Kedia.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.120
Okay...

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.000
Hi.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.360
- Just a second.
- I am sorry to interrupt you.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.320
That's okay.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.560
Can I see your treasury chief,
Mr. Niraj Chopra?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.480
Did you have an appointment
with him today?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.400
Just tell him it's Harshad Mehta.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.640
Uhm...
Sorry, sir, but he is not available.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.520
Can you give me an appointment
with him for tomorrow?

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.920
Sir, I'm afraid but he's leaving
for Madras tomorrow.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.960
He will be out of station
for a while.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.440
So, he has no time during
the day at all?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.400
He has a flight to catch.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.000
Niraj <i>Bhai</i>.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.640
What a coincidence! Wow!

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.480
I'm Harshad, Harshad Mehta.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.280
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.560
In India...

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.640
...the money market is not a market
in the Western sense of the term.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.680
Here, it's more like a jungle.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.760
[Niraj] 'I'm not surprised Tyagu
threw you out. B*****d.'

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.600
He doesn't give us any business
nor does he let us do it on our own.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.080
Why would he entertain you?

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.280
-[Niraj] 'Look, Harshad, right?'
- Yeah.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.200
Citibank is the king of this jungle.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.800
They've made the whole money market
into an exclusive club.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.400
And they do not like outsiders.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.960
Today, the money market feels like
the territory of one bank and its brokers.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.080
It's a goddamn cartel.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.120
And Tyagi, he's the boss
of this cartel.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.800
And his brokers, Ajay Kedia,
Hiten Shroff, Hemendra Kapadia...

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.160
...these people have cornered
most of the money market.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.200
We are at their goddamn mercy.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.720
The moment we crack a deal
they get to know.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.120
In simple words...

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.400
This cookie is the market.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.040
And the cartel is enjoying
eating the whole cookie.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.120
No, I get it.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.680
Citibank has its own cartel...
with Tyagi and his brokers.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.520
So, why can't we form
our own cartel against them?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.680
No, I'm serious.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.680
Tell me honestly, Niraj <i>Bhai</i>.
Have you never thought of this?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.840
Of course, I have. Often, in fact.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.920
And like this, I have
many other fantasies too.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.040
But we also have ethics.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.960
Tyagi and his cartel know no ethics.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.560
We can't do dirty business like them.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.880
I understand. You should never do
dirty business.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.720
But I can, right?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.520
Do you think...

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.440
...Tyagi really knows how his brokers
bring him business?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960
Yes and no.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.360
So similarly, you don't need to know
how I get you the business.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.240
You show the path.
Just tell me where to start.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.600
My time, my effort.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.280
And you have nothing to lose.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.760
You knew I was going to be
on this flight, right?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.960
Yes and no.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.640
A cartel is as good as its members.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.400
The man we're meeting today...

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.920
He's a potential member to your cartel.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.160
Our cartel.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.600
Your cartel.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.240
'I have many contacts
at Grindlays.'

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.040
I used to work at Grindlays.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.920
It's confirmed that...

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.760
...Grindlays is on the look-out
for money market brokers.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.840
And they don't want anyone
from the Citibank cartel.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.240
'<i>All that is fine, but
the biggest problem is, Citibank.</i>'

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.920
They have all the funds
to buy the securities.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.280
Once they corner the market,
their brokers manipulate everything...

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.640
Seems like you don't watch TV.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.200
Of course.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.600
Well then, haven't you seen...

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.680
..."one sparrow, then more sparrows...
Land to peck at some seeds..."

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.920
The solution lies within that.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.680
What?

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.640
Look, Citibank throws birdseed...

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.040
And like a sparrow, every bank begins
pecking on it, that too alone.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.200
And so, it's easy to get trapped.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.560
And what's your point?

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.800
The point is, it's time for
all banks to come together.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.960
Like this. We are one.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.240
We are strong.
We are courageous.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.440
Once we unite, we can achieve big things.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.320
We just can't deal with any bank.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.960
We also have to think about profit and loss.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.880
For once, flap your wings together and
fly off with the hunter's net.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.840
Profit will follow.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.720
And once Citibank and its brokers
lose a deal...

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.840
...we can cut the net they have woven.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.760
Look, I'm a man of the share market.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.960
I think long-term.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.760
If as a broker, I am ready to bear a loss.
You are banks after all.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.160
What do you say, Niraj <i>Bhai</i>?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.800
<i>"One, two, three..."</i>

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.240
Let's do it.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.800
<i>"Clever little sparrows...
Smart little sparrows..."</i>

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.400
<i>"Off they go...
carrying the net along..."</i>

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.400
<i>"...flocking together, birds of a feather."</i>

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.760
I hear that Grindlays too
has joined hands with Harshad?

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.840
Well. They are not
dealing with us anymore.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.880
Plus, Harshad is going
after many small banks...

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.840
...and institutions that
we don't even touch.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.600
But he is getting volumes.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.720
He's buying as much as he can.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.720
He has even bought some at a loss.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.600
Is he an idiot?

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.360
[Niraj] 'Honestly Harshad...'

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.920
'...I don't think the cartel will
really bother about us right now.'

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.280
Yeah, we may have some business
but nowhere close to them.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.680
And we never will because Citibank
controls the volume.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.560
- It's simple as that.
- It's time...

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.600
...to go to the big boss of security dealings...
The bank which trumps Citibank.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.480
Citibank may be the don of
the money market...

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.480
...but who's the emperor
of banking in India?

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.120
To fight Citibank,
we must think local.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.960
[Harshad] 'You see, sir. We have done
our detailed study in the money market.'

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.440
'There are a lot of foreign banks,
there are dealers, there are cartels...'

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.000
'...and they are making good money.'

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.480
'I would really say that SBI needs
to be a little more aggressive in this. '

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.200
'And all this data...'

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.800
'...is absolutely backed by the solid research
that we have done at Growmore.'

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.320
'We know that SBI often
has huge demand for bonds.'

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.920
'Because of the heavy investments...'

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.960
...coming from institutional investors,
right?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.360
And we can easily source
these securities for you.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.360
In fact, there's no need
to be worried.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.280
All transactions will be safe.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.480
And we will offer you the best
brokerage rates in the market.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.840
Growmore is known for that.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.080
Please have a seat.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.080
Thank you.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.200
Mr. Mehta,
we've done our research too...

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.120
about you... and your ways...

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.800
[Khemani] 'We too have friends
in the market.'

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.040
You have your own methods.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.880
And you love taking
on the big players.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.440
- Actually, sir...
-[Khemani] 'And you have...'

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.400
...faced huge losses at times...

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.320
...because of your own methods.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.520
But, it's also true that...

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.000
...you've never let your
clients suffer a loss.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.920
Not even after the last market crash.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.080
You are a man of integrity.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.480
Thank you.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.640
Here, brokers team up with foreign banks
to manipulate quotes...

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.520
...for their and their client's benefit.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.040
We're meeting you today,
not because we want to play safe.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.560
But because we want
to change the image of SBI.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.440
Growmore is at the top
of our priority list...

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.360
...because you know how to take risks.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.720
These foreign banks and their brokers
have been looting us for years.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.240
It's high time
we set our house in order.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.480
-[Khemani] 'Isn't it'?
- Absolutely.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.200
We are in business, Mr. Mehta.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.960
[Ajay] 'Apparently, he might just add
a new word to the financial dictionary.'

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.800
Bankerage!

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.560
What is this? A new gimmick?

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.120
You're not going to
like this one bit.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.720
Harshad has started taking
positions in the money market too...

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.320
...and that too,
by using banks as a front.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.440
They're getting a commission.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.720
He calls it 'bankerage'!

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.280
And the banks are
doing it happily. Even SBI.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.960
No, no, no, A.K.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960
This is serious.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.320
I've always said, it's a crime
for brokers to take any position.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.120
And all this makes Harshad
our competition now.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.760
We must keep a close eye
on all his actions.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.960
And I mean, all actions.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.000
I need the details
of all his transactions.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.720
We can't be caught napping on this.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.120
No.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.000
[Pranav] 'I said, why would I take a favour
from you for such a small matter?'

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.440
'I'd come to you for something big.'

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.320
- Not for me.
- Huh?

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.960
One foot in the money market...
and you've given up sweets?

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.800
Not given up...
...just controlling.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.720
When did you start controlling yourself?

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.480
Well, these days, aren't you the one who's
out of control?

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.440
I've seen how high you've pushed ACC...
out of control.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.360
Keeping tabs on the market, huh?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.680
Looks like the cheetah is missing his jungle!

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.120
But the word is,
it's time to ditch ACC.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.160
Manu <i>Bhai</i> and his men are targeting it.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.320
If they start shorting,
I don't have the funds to hold on.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.200
This is the problem with us Bulls.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.400
The moment we depend on the market for funds,
those bears get to know.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.040
By the way, how much do you need?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.520
[Harshad] <i>'This is the right time
to get back into the market.'</i>

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.480
[Ashwin] <i>'Sure. Who's stopping you?'</i>

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.720
But don't go after ACC.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.880
Look, if Pranav doesn't have the funds,
it's not like we have a treasure chest.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.960
Canara Bank wanted
to buy some securities, right?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.200
They were to send a cheque?

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.640
There it is.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.360
Harshad, whom should we
buy the bonds from?

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.800
Grindlays will have, right?

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.720
Once we get the BRs, I'll deliver them
personally to Canara Bank.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.080
It's been a while
since I've been there.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.400
Let's deposit all these cheques
into our account today.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.080
Canara Bank needs the securities
after ten days.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.000
Harshad, you...

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.440
Are you out of your mind?

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.960
This is not our money.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.880
If we want to get back in
the market, this is our treasure chest.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.480
Harshad, it's
a ready forward deal.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.560
Once the BR expires,
we'll have to return the money.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.960
And we will.
We have ten whole days.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.880
Till then, this money will be rotting away
in our account in any case.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.920
If we invest it in the market,
the money will grow and so will the market.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.800
And when it comes out in the open,
our troubles will grow too.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.680
There won't be any trouble.
We are not stealing.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.680
The money is lying in our account.
What we do with it is nobody's concern.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.320
Imagine. How much profit
we can make in 10 days!

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.440
[Sucheta] <i>'The Bull was
back in BSE.'</i>

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.800
<i>'And his first bet, was on ACC.'</i>

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.000
<i>'The bears were destroying ACC.'</i>

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.560
<i>'But they didn't have
even the slightest hint...'</i>

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.960
<i>'...that this time,
Harshad didn't just have money...'</i>

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.240
<i>'...he had the whole bazaar of wealth.'</i>

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.120
<i>'Often, to save time in security dealings,</i>

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.520
<i>'banks would deposit funds
directly into brokers' accounts'</i>

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.360
<i>'so that the broker could
crack the best deals before buying.'</i>

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.320
<i>'Harshad saw the loophole here.'</i>

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.200
<i>'With this money now lying in his account,
he began investing in the share market again.'</i>

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.080
<i>'It was a slow system...'</i>

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.080
<i>'...so the money would often remain
in the brokers' account for upto a fortnight.'</i>

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.560
<i>'It was readily available for Harshad
to use as his own...'</i>

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.280
<i>'...and push up any stock he liked.'</i>

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.560
<i>'By rotating banking funds
in the share market...'</i>

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.520
<i>'...he was making so much profit...'</i>

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.840
<i>'...that he began making
money market deals at lower commissions.'</i>

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.400
<i>'Banks were getting the best deals...'</i>

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.080
<i>'And Harshad was making
more and more profit.'</i>

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.320
<i>'The money market had turned
into a money-making market for him.'</i>

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.720
Sure, we can join this.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.320
Madam, a flat this big in Bombay
at such a prime location, is rare.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.920
The Sensex is touching 1400.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.640
At 1600 we should start selling.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.520
I hope you are okay with that.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.160
Share markets are your territory.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.480
Do what you feel is best.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.640
But, what if the index rises even more?

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.640
Harshad is being really bullish.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.520
Come on! Come on, who is he?
How much money does he have?

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.160
He can't just go on buying
more and more.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.120
See, you are not getting the point.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.760
He has the funds.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.480
He's using banking funds
to push up the markets.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.280
He's caught on quick?

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.160
He's using a trick out of our book.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.840
The only difference is that we do it
safely, and in a classy way.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.320
And he does it in a classless,
crude way.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.640
No...

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.240
We need a strategy to stop him.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.400
Let's use our banking funds
to short the markets.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.960
We have to do whatever we can.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.560
Attack, divide, engage...

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.720
...and defeat.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.520
Stanchart wants securities
worth 200 crores.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.240
- So?
- What do you mean, 'so'?

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.880
None of our banks hold
such a huge amount of securities.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.720
Tell me something.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.600
How often have we delivered
physical securities to banks?

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.080
Have we ever handed them over
in person?

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.480
But brother, we have to give
BRs as proof, don't we?

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.440
Once the bank gives the receipt,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.360
It means they're confirming
that the securities received.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.440
Think like a donkey and you'll remain one.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.520
What?

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.840
Stanchart wants
BRs worth 200 crores, right?

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.880
- Yes.
- So, we'll give BRs.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.200
Isn't that what Citibank cartel does?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.760
'Harshad <i>Bhai</i>, how can I do
what you are asking me to?'

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.480
- This is not legal.
- There's nothing wrong in it.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.600
But if I don't have the securities,
how can I issue BRs to them...?

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.920
How can I sell something I don't have
and give you a receipt for it?

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.440
- This is wrong.
- This is not wrong. It's survival.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.640
I'm aware that you don't even
have funds to pay salaries.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.880
So, this is a sure-shot way to rescue
your bank from its losses.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.120
It's very simple.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.360
Stanchart wants securities
worth 200 crores?

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960
You just issue the BRs.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.160
Give them the receipt.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.040
As soon as they get the receipt,
200 crores will be in your account.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.280
Of which, 4 crores will be yours.
Bankerage.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.560
Within 15 days,
I'll return 200 crores to them.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.960
They'll return the BRs to you.
Then tear them off, if you like.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.240
They will get the securities.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.720
You will get a commission.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.920
Citibank does all its business
through BRs.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.920
And look sir, even you know,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.360
that physical securities are
never exchanged in any deal.

Talk to the Department of
Banking Operations and Development.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.720
I want the security departments

- Yes, Ghosh?
- Sir, Citibank?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.160
Hmmm. It's a foreign bank.
We have to be careful.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.120
Our economy is still recovering.
It hasn't stabilised yet.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.240
We are still dependent on the loans
arranged by them.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.320

And, Ghosh...

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.400
Make it look like a regular audit.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.480
Not an investigation.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.040
The matter shouldn't leave this room.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.920
The Press mustn't get to know of it.
Thank you.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.640
And which is the fifth bank?
Indian Bank?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.200
Great. Are you sure?

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.960
And you're sure there will be inspections
in all these banks today?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.480
[Man] <i>'Madam, these are
only the first five banks.'</i>

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.120
<i>'The RBI will go after
other banks too.'</i>

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.800
<i>'All these b******s
stand exposed now.'</i>

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.840
<i>'Even small banks like
Bank of Karaj'</i>

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.080
<i>'No account of securities there either.'</i>

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.120
So, what's RBI planning?
I mean, what's their next step going to be?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.640
[Man] <i>'As usual, they'll issue a circular
on the buying and selling of securities.'</i>

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.040
<i>'RBI will issue new rules.'</i>

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.720
<i>'And they'll add some
more points, what else?'</i>

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.640
Can you link me to any broker?

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.640
[Man] <i>'Oh no. Unless the
news of this inspection goes public...'</i>

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.960
<i>'...all the brokers will keep
their mouth shut.'</i>

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.160
<i>'Does anybody ever speak
without a reason?'</i>

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.080
But reasons can be created, right?

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.920
[Sucheta] <i>'While both Harshad and
the RBI kept their sights focused on the banks'</i>

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.800
<i>'I was focused on my new job
with The Times of India.'</i>

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.760
<i>'None of us knew that our
paths were going to cross very soon.'</i>

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.200
Nor is there the name of a bank
nor a source.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.400
Sucheta, without any names,
I can't print this.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.240
My source works
in one of these banks.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.440
The story is 100 percent legit.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.840
Maybe. But can anyone confirm it?

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.080
- I can't.
- Rajdeep, this story is huge...

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.160
...And it will only get bigger,
but only if you print this.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.400
-[Rajdeep] 'Sucheta, you know my answer.'
- You need to trust me.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.760
When the rest of the media
was singing Rajan Pillai's praises...

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.800
...I was the one who reported his brush
with the law in Singapore and it snowballed.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.360
I have the same hunch with this.
Print it.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.400
Only then will everyone
in the banking system know...

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.560
...that inside information can't
stay hidden forever.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.760
And if we print this, and no one
opens their mouth after that...

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.040
Then? I can't risk putting this
on the front page.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.160
- Where will you put it?
- The financial section.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.880
No chance, sir.
No chance.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.840
I'm absolutely sure, this information
hasn't leaked from our end.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.040
It's from some bank.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.600
But since this news
is already out in the open...

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.520
...can we announce a proper audit
to confirm the irregularities?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.000
The public
doesn't want an audit.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.800
No, Ghosh, that won't work.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.480
Issue a directive
and share it with the press.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.440
Everyone must know clearly...

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.600
...that the RBI has issued strict
guidelines on the use of BRs.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.280
[Tyagi] 'Kedia told me that you've
refused all ready forward deals?'

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.240
'Sir, The RBI is on our tail, sir.'

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.160
But where is the problem
if you're all covered up?

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.760
Sir, RBI has issued
a new circular.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.640
Haven't you read the guidelines, Sir?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.400
Look at this, sir.
These are strict orders.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.400
"All ready forward transactions..."

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.440
"...whether through the mechanism
of SGL or BR..."

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.440
"...should be reflected on the same day
in its investment account."

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.520
"Transactions between one bank
and another bank..."

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.880
"...should not be put
through the brokers' accounts."

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.840
"Banks should not act as agents
for any broker clients."

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.720
And the most important part.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.360
"All transactions should be
at market rates, strictly."

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.320
And...

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.520
- You never deal at market rates.
- Stop it.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.800
It's RBI, not the CBI.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.320
And these are guidelines,
not the law.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.880
And this is India.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.240
[Tyagi] 'You know
nothing ever happens here.'

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.560
And look, if you want to stay in business...

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.800
...then you'll have to do business, right?

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.040
I'm sorry, Mr. Tyagi.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.200
But we'll stick to the guidelines
for any business.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.720
You tell me. Am I old?

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.000
This new generation just won't listen.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.440
They call the experienced, old
and push us away.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.480
I told my son...

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.560
...that the money market
is a mess. Don't get into it.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.840
But he didn't listen. And look.
Today, every deal is a struggle.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.560
Suresh, a person is only
as old as his thoughts.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.920
Age is just a number.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.080
-[Suresh] 'Why don't you explain this to my son?'
- But you never introduced us!

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.920
I would've explained all about age and
also taken a follow-up on that fake BR story.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.400
Oh. So, I'm useless now?

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.840
New source. New story?

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.040
Suresh...
Okay, why do I call you Suresh?

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.200
Because you're a friend
and not just a source.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.320
Everyone has suppressed the BR story.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.240
And if I don't get a follow-up,
it will die.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.040
Okay, I'll talk to him
when I see him.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.920
- He might agree.
- Isn't he in the office?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.520
He's in office 24/7.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.640
But despite being next-door...
he doesn't even talk to me, let alone meeting.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.640
Okay. I'll take your leave.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:47.760
[Sucheta] 'Sorry...'

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.040
- I just need two minutes.
- What... What are you doing here?

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.840
I am Sucheta Dalal from
Times of India.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.800
[DT] 'I know who you are.'

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.440
I don't want to speak to you.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.320
Listen, it's okay.
Your father already knows me.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.800
- I just need a little bit of info...
- Do you want me to call the security?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.600
No no...
Please, don't misunderstand me.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.240
- I just need a little bit of info...
-[bell rings]

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.800
Please leave.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.840
Okay, your father has my number
if you ever want to talk.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.920
Okay. Sorry. Thank you.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.440
The RBI is checking every line
from every page of every book.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.920
Okay. Let's talk like bankers.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.000
Forget the securities.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.400
I'm sure you can give me a loan?

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.600
Tell me. What line of credit
can you offer?

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.440
To give a loan, I need funds, don't I?

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.960
I'm not refusing.
But we're facing a major crunch for funds.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.200
You too are stranded
because of funds, huh?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.120
Okay. What if I bring customers...

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.240
...who will deposit large amounts
in this bank?

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.080
Then you will give me a loan, right?

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.800
[Sucheta] <i>'RBI had chained the whole
system with its guidelines.'</i>

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.000
<i>'Harshad knew that even the bear cartel
was on a dry-run with no cash.'</i>

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.920
<i>'This was the time
to get ahead of them.'</i>

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.240
Docking charges, fuel charges...
altogether...

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.240
...they make a weekly collection
of 20 to 25 crores.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.760
And that too, liquid.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.960
Everything is liquid at the docks
and in the sea.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.600
Just imagine...

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.400
What if we channelize
all their funds to RICO?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.480
Then the funds will eventually
come back to us.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.520
Wait a minute, brother.
Tell me something. Are you a king?

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.440
Or a <i>LO.O.T.SE.SEA</i>?

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.120
- <i>LO.O.T.SE.SEA?</i>
- Lord Of The Seven Seas?

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.320
That you will beckon, and the docks
will pour their entire fund into RICO?

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.040
Rubbish!

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.960
Everyone bows down to profit.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.600
And I know how to weave a story
about profit.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.680
And Bhushan, where these funds
should be invested...

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.920
...is the prerogative of the chairman.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.640
All we have to do,
is convince the chairman.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.040
And what is this story you plan to weave?
Please explain.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.520
Look, RICO has no funds to give a loan.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.440
If this money goes there,
they'll get funds...

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.560
...and we'll get a loan.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.720
What's the interest rate for a loan?
11 percent?

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.360
Assume, we take this loan
at 12 percent.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.800
[Bhushan] 'That means, one percent
for the chairman.'

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.040
'But brother, the money will still go
from our pocket, right?'

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.360
[Harshad] 'So, let it.'

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.320
<i>'When we invest this loan in the
market and make a huge profit... '</i>

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.200
<i>'...this one or two percent
will fade in comparison.'</i>

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.800
Look, Mr. Gaithonde, you have to deposit
your money in one bank or the other.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.400
Why don't you deposit it
in RICO bank this time?

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.720
You will earn an interest from the bank...

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.760
...but I'm interested
in your interest too.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.600
You understand, don't you?

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.160
Give me some time.
Let me think about it.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.440
Come, let me explain.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.960
Look, I'm a man of the share market.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.800
So, rather than in time,
I believe in instant deals.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.440
If we give it too much time,
the value might drop.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.160
And the value of this deal
might drop too.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.360
Are you sure Amitabh Bachchan
gets his suits made here?

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.800
Yes. Mine too.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.560
That's good.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.280
Harshad is no less than
the Bachchan of BSE.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.720
Our angry young man, who's taken on
the cartel all alone.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.720
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.040
And, Mr. Jobber, life isn't a movie...

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.240
...with an interval
for popcorns and snacks.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.400
Life keeps changing.
Nothing's permanent.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.600
What do you say, Harshad?

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.240
It can be permanent.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.120
If funds keep flowing,
we will be permanent bulls.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.240
Not just Bull.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.000
Big Bull.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.960
Hey, all banks
are in RBI's radar.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.560
They have to consult the RBI

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.120
Gone are the old ways
of conducting security business.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.120
You know Sucheta Dalal, from Times of India?
She's writing an article.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.960
If your name crops up
in relation to BRs...

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.760
...she'll be knocking at your door.
Be careful.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.240
And what will she do
once she reaches me? Huh?

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.440
I don't deal
in securities anymore.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.080
What do you mean
you don't deal in securities?

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.840
What I mean Pranav <i>Bhai</i>...
is that there is a ton of government money...

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.240
...gathering dust in PSUs.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.280
So, let's invest that money in BSE.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.920
Government must
earn some profit too, right?

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.240
Sir, frankly speaking, government PSUs
need a fresh approach.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.680
You know well, ONGC
has so much money, but no plan.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.680
In fact, when we discussed our ideas
with the minister, he clearly said...

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.440
..."Go meet Mr. Nawalakha.
He is the man with a vision".

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.000
But, Mr. Mehta...

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.960
This is the government's money.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.960
We can't allow it to be invested
in the stock market.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.200
But that's not what I'm saying.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.120
All I'm saying is, invest
in the PMS schemes of banks.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.240
Look, sir. My job is
to make profit.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.600
And I will make profit
for the government too.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.920
We just need to match our vision.
