Sir, I need to meet the editor.
It's very urgent, sir.

Oh, your good name?

Sir, I have some confidential information.

So, which editor
would you like to meet?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.240
Executive editor? City editor?
Sports editor? Business editor?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.240
- Sir, any editor will do...
- Associate editor?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800
I don't have much time, Sir.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.400
If it is wasted, my information
will turn stale.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.920
Sir, maybe I can give it to you...

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.280
- You look like a senior editor yourself.
- Oh, no, no...

I'm just a common man, you see.

- It seems your news
is very important. - Yes, sir.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.240
I think you should meet the business editor,
Mr. Kiran Ajgaonkar.

[Kiran] 'Yes, I'm there for the edition.

Laxman sir?

Kiran, someone is looking for you.

Why did you take the trouble, sir?
You could've asked a peon.

Water?

No, thank you, sir. There is
a huge problem at SBI, sir.

Oh, bank receipt.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.200
Sir, there is no SGL note either.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.280
In the PDO, the books aren't tallying.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.760
It's a big problem, sir.

SGL? PDO?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.840
Sir, SGL is

...and PDO is Public Debt Office, sir.
Of the RBI.

I'll send you to someone
who will understand this.

that the strike was getting over, right?

statement from Manu Mundra about the strike.

I need to know
what changed so suddenly.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.280
Fine. Should I also talk to
a couple of my other sources there?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.440
Yeah. But please don't start
gossiping there.

respecting deadlines, yeah?

again and again, right?

Yes. Deadlines must be respected.
Correct.

No. I mean, tell me why are you here?

Organise a cup of tea, please. - Tea? No.

Yeah. No, the strike thing is still developing.
So, I need to focus on that.

Ma'am, I'm Sharad Bellary

I just want to tell you that there's
something very fishy going on at SBI.

It's a huge scandal.

You can't even begin to imagine
how big the fraud is.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960

Five hundred crores are missing

Payments have been made
without any BRs.

- BR means...
- Bank receipts, I know.

What do you do at SBI?
Which department do you work in?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.360
It's PR, ma'am. Public relations.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.960
Then, how do you know this?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.600
Ma'am, this has been going on
for a while now.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.360
They are having
meetings upon meetings daily.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.400
But things are out of control now.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.520
Because we didn't even receive the SGL,
ma'am.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.200
How will they show it in the books?
I mean... I'm so... I...

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.640
- SGL means...
- Subsidiary General Ledger, I know.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.040
So, SBI has issued a payment
of 500 crores.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.440
And the SGL and BRs due in exchange
haven't been received.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.080
You do know
what you're saying, right?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.840
Five hundred crore is such a huge amount,
even a calculator may shy away from it.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.800
Yes, that's how big the fraud is.
Maybe even bigger than that.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.600
- Come. We're done.
- Come on. I am done too.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.960
Come, let's have some <i>paan</i>.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.960
- I'll have a plain one...
- I know, <i>Pappa</i>.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.880
- Without areca, right?
- Done.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.240
The eggplant was really good, right?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.960
How long will we live like this?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.560
What do you mean?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.080
I'm talking about the house.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.720
It feels like a rush-hour train.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.360
If this continues,
we'll soon be punching and elbowing each other.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.720
<i>Bhai</i>, this difficulty is here to stay.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840
And staying here is difficult.
That's what I mean.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.720
Look... take my advice...

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.280
Jyoti and you should find a small house
and shift.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.480
- A separate house, nearby.
- What are you saying?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.240
If we have to shift,
why don't we all shift together?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.320
- Let's find a big house.
- Big house?

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.840
Do we have that much money?
Big house!

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.040
Money is our real problem.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.440
Today, even the diamond-market
has lost its shine.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.760
This diamond trading
will fetch us nothing.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.240
It will.
Everything will be okay.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.320
- Slowly, but surely.
- Slowly, my foot!

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.720
Everyone is busy doing something
or the other.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.520
Even a snack-seller is buying cars...

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.400
...some are making a triple
profit in textiles...

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.160
Everyone's pockets are full.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.160
Look at Jimesh. He has made so much money
in the share market.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.320
<i>Bhai</i>, you can dabble a little
in the share market.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.160
But we can't depend on that.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.200
- It's too risky.
- What do you mean ‘risky'?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.880
Jimesh has involved
his entire family in this business.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.480
Even his mother-in-law.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.840
Instead of counting her last days,
she's counting money.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.280
<i>Bhai,</i> we're not
Jimesh's mother-in-law.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.480
If something goes wrong, Shantilal
will kill us before Jimesh's mother-in-law dies.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.080
It'll be the end of us.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.640
Jimesh's mother-in-law, he says!

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.440
Think calmly.
I'm sure there is a way.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.240
- Ashwin?
- Yes?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.960
Listen to me.
You also get married.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.480
- What do you mean, get married?
- Why not?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.840
Have you seen the size of our house?

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.520
I'm sure there is a way.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.480
<i>Pappa</i>, what is she saying?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.320
Where will my wife sleep?
On the ceiling?

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.200
[giggling]

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.920
Stop laughing. Go to sleep.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.880
- Stay single, then.
- Okay.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.640
- You're in a mood today?
- Shouldn't I be?

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.480
- Hey! Everyone's asleep.
- So?

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.560
<i>Pappa</i> will wake up!

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.080
It's a small house. It's risky.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.320
Well, this house will not turn
into a bungalow overnight.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.040
We will have to take the risk.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.120
And anyway, risk is the spice of life.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.480
Uncle, move!
Why don't you reduce this paunch!

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.800
I'm serious about the share market.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.320
- So?
- If we do it right, we can make a lot of money.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.600
Sure we can make money, but it's a risk.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.560
Risk is the spice of life.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.400
What?

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.520
Look... If you know anyone, introduce me.
I will dive into it.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.600
Okay, but do you have the time?
Can you handle it?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.560
We only have time to spend.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.080
Or we spend ourselves waiting for the right time.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.920
<i>Bhai</i>, these dialogues are great.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.200
But it's not that easy.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.880
- Give it a thought.
- Done.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.280
- Look... you always...
- I've made up my mind.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.880
That's enough.
Give me some sweet pickle.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.880
Are you done?
Now let me eat in peace.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.760
Have you worked anywhere before this?

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.400
I've done lots of jobs in my life.
I'm sure I can start as a jobber here.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.600
- You won't understand it.
- Why not?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.800
I understand business.
I'm just new to the market.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.120
And for us Gujaratis,
business is greater than religion, right?

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.040
<i>Bhai</i>, you don't have to be
well-read to become a jobber.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.080
Even those who quit after the fifth-grade
work as jobbers here.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.560
I failed my fifth grade.
I mean, i took two attempts to clear.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.440
Give me some <i>ghee</i>.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.480
- Pick up the phone.
- Huh?

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.200
Pick the phone up.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.640
25-50-37.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.960
Listen carefully. I won't repeat.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.560
One plate <i>bhindi</i>, one plate <i>gatta</i>...

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.560
...<i>rajwadi kadi</i>, <i>jain khichdi</i>,
two <i>rotis</i>.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.920
Two <i>bhakri</i>, two <i>papad</i>,
one roasted, one fried. And <i>raita</i>.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.480
Also, an onion-tomato salad.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.680
Hello, yes, take an order.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.800
One plate <i>bhindi</i>, one plate <i>gatta</i>,
<i>rajwadi kadi</i>...

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.160
...<i>jain khichdi</i>, two rotis.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.400
Two <i>bhakri</i>, two <i>papad</i>,
one roasted, one fried.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.000
And... an onion-tomato salad.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.160
- And...
- <i>Raita</i>.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.120
And <i>raita</i>.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.760
Cancel it.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.120
I'm full.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.240
Okay, cancel the order.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.800
Uh... in the hurry... I forgot <i>raita</i>...

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.240
So, what should we do?

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.440
Hire me, I'm like your son.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.400
Tomorrow 9 am.
Bhushan will take you to the ring.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.840
- Who's Bhushan?
- Our old jobber.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.040
He knows the market very well.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.920
Let's see, if the door to your destiny
opens in the market tomorrow.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.160
- Black Cobra.
- Huh?

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.720
The one you're staring at.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.880
His name is Manu Mundra.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.160
But in the market, he's known as
Black Cobra.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.640
He's the biggest pessimist in the market.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.720
Pessimist?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.600
When the market is moving up,
he pulls it back down.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:06.080
The lower the market falls,
the higher Manu Mundra's profits.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.880
- So, he's a Bear.
- Yes, he's a Bear.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.640
- And you are?
- Bhushan Bhatt.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.880
- Harshad Mehta.
- I know, Harshad Shantilal Mehta.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.800
Ambalal <i>Saheb</i> has sent me.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.080
I'm his old jobber.
Here, wear this.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.240
From now on, this will be your identity
in the market. Okay?

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.800
Come on.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.880
[car honks]

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.240
Park it in the back lot. Be careful.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.880
Pranav Sheth!

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.080
You will kill us here
like you do in the market?

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.080
If you come in my way,
I will have to run you over, Bhushan darling!

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.680
Pranav <i>Bhai</i>, got any tips?
We have a rookie here.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.640
Hello.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.960
I don't give tips for free
even to my own father.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.760
Get it? Silly jobber!

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.520
He's also one of a kind. Pranav Sheth.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.840
He has played a big game
in a short period of time.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.800
He is an optimist.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.880
He is one of those who
push the market upwards.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.160
- You mean, he's a Bull.
- Yes, Bull.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.960
Do you know why these pessimists
and optimists are called Bears and Bulls?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.600
Tell me?

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.200
A bear always hits
it's prey downwards.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.880
And a bull always tosses its prey
upwards with its horns.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.120
Seems you've read some English books.
Homework, is it? Good.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.360
But remember.
This is not America's Wall Street.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.360
This is Bombay's Dalal Street.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.480
And this here, is a betting ground.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.680
It doesn't matter if the bear hits you
downwards or the bull tosses you upwards.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.720
Either way, you will be knocked out.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.280
So, don't be over smart.
Okay? Let's go.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.960
[Bhushan] 'You will remember
the signs, right?'

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.280
This means the customer wants to sell
and this means he wants to buy.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.560
Use your fingers to convey
the quantity and the price. Okay?

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.920
Do you remember what I taught you?
25 paise, 50 paise, 12, 12.5...

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.160
...27.5, 5, 500.
It could also be 5,000.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.320
- And remember... Listen!
- Huh?

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.640
If you don't understand something,
ask me.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.200
If you don't ask, you won't learn.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.280
Don't think you're an expert
on your first day.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920
Okay? Come.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.680
- That's 25.
- No... I've to go to the toilet.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.040
You can hold it for two hours! Let's go!

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.640
If you see a crowded spot,
consider that's our area.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.000
And that's where you will stay.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.800
And the area with a small crowd,
assume that a slum...

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.480
...only shillings and pennies...
we don't do business there.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.320
Why?

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.960
Because that's where
the penny stock jobbers operate.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.240
Small shares sold at cheap prices.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.720
Always stay away from small change.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.800
Because we deal only in
high-value stocks.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.040
It's a game of millions.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.560
So keep your eyes, ears
and mind wide open.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.080
Okay, tell me something.
What's our national sport?

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.160
- Cricket.
- Hey! It's hockey.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.840
Oh yes, hockey.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.040
This is just like hockey.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.320
At the sound of the bell,
starts the jobber's hell.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.680
And at the last bell,
well... game over.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.040
During this, the one who strikes
the most goals, wins.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.760
[Bhushan] 'So concentrate, my champion.'

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.920
[crowd screaming]

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.440
Hey! What are you grinning at?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.080
This is not a movie!

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.080
If you don't strike deals...

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.040
...your first day will be your last!

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.080
Come on, get to work!

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.080
550... 500...

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.760
[loudspeaker announcement]

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.320
[Ambalal] 'What an auspicious beginning!'

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.760
You've started with a mess!
<i>Vaandha</i>! Do you understand?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.400
Tell him what <i>vaandha</i> means.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.000
That means... you've sold stocks
worth 25,000.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.720
But the dealer says he has only bought
stocks worth 23,000.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.320
- So this difference of 2,000...
- ...That's a loss!

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.640
Do you understand loss?
Who will cover it?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.760
<i>Saheb</i>, I had told him to keep his
eyes, ears, and mind wide open.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.400
See... It was so crowded, so noisy...

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.120
The ring felt like a fish market.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.600
Things were happening so fast.
I must have made a mistake.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.360
You're right.
You have made a mistake.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.480
If you can't even calculate...
leave the ring.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.520
Look, I agree I've made a mistake.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.560
And as far as the loss goes,
you can deduct that from my salary.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.600
"Deduct from my salary", he says!

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.360
Make him understand...
...no profit means no salary.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.200
I will surely make profit.
Give me one more chance.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.120
Giving you a chance means
taking a risk, which I can't afford.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.520
Not taking risks, is the biggest risk
in the market.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.040
If nothing, the market has taught me
this in one day.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.840
Do you think…

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.640
…Ambalal <i>saheb</i> has done you a favour
by giving you another chance?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.360
I've known him for years.
He's a master of his game.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.760
Remember one thing. If it doesn't serve his purpose,
he will even give up on God.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.360
Your 2,000 rupee loss
makes no difference to him.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.200
You've sold stocks worth
25,000 on your very first day.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.440
Do you think he'd let you go
so easily? Huh?

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.200
You just have to focus
and hit goal after goal. That's it.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.680
[Bhushan] 'Don't worry. Have some tea.'

[Sucheta] <i>'Harshad had only one thing

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.120

Excuse me! Hey! Listen.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.960
- How much for Premier Auto?
- 32.5-35.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.440
For what quantity is it valid?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.400
- Five hundred.
- Fine, give me 500.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.400
Five hundred for 35.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.000
Can you give me 500 more
for the same value?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.960
- 35-37.5.
- Okay, fine. Give me 500.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.160
How much for another 1,000 shares?

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.040
- 37.5-40.
- That's quite high!

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.920
- Okay, I'll buy 1,000.
- Take it.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.400
- Can you give me 1,000 more?
- I'm done.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.080
Come on, be brave!
Sell me some more.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.880
I'm out of shares!
Go to the bigger guys.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.600
They're all out... Hey...

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.280
What are you doing?

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.960
PREMIERE AUTO WILL INCREASE
CAR PRICES SHORTLY

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.640
I understand now why shares
of Premier Auto...

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.400
...have been selling like hotcakes
for the last few days.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.800
Look at this.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.320
Premier is hiking the prices
of its cars.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.760
Someone must've
leaked this information.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.920
It's the people with such information
who make tons of money.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.040
This is called insider trading.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.880
It's dealt with strictly, outside India.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.960
Just wait and watch.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.160
Premier Auto will be
in high demand today.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.640
If the price surges,
we'll incur a huge loss.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.200
We can't work like this.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.480
We must gather such
insider information too.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.640
Have you lost your mind?

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.120
This is a rich man's game.
We can't play it.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.680
Don't start with games again!

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.400
You keep turning the market into
a game of hockey... a wrestling pit... a boxing ring...

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.880
And that's our problem.
We never play the real game.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.440
We only watch the rich at play,
and cheer for them.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.520
- Why don't we enter the playground?
- Huh?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.400
[Harshad] 'Even if as the 12th man,
let's enter the playground this time.'

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.960
'Let's make contacts at a small level,
among the employees...'

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.640
'...like workers, watchmen,
peons, union workers...'

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.720
'If we look hard, I'm sure we'll find someone
who knows the details of the company's decisions.'

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.440
[Factory Workers] 'Fulfil our demands...'

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.480
'Fulfil our demands...'

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.600
What's this protest about, brother?

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.120
Same as always...

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.760
'Fulfil our demands...'

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.840
Keep going.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.080
Who's this doctor <i>saheb</i>?

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.640
Doctor <i>saheb</i>, is Dr. Dada Satam.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.200
He's a doctor by profession but he's
also the leader of all these unions.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.120
All final decisions are taken by him.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.800
Yes, tell me. What's the problem?

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.040
[in Marathi] Doctor, what can I say?

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.720
[in Marathi] I want lots of trouble.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.360
Don't speak in wrong Marathi.
I know Hindi very well.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.720
- Tell me.
- Oh, then I don't have any problem.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.080
The market has a problem.
The market is really in a problem.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.360
All day, people screaming nonstop.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.760
Sometimes the price is up,
sometimes it's down.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.720
Sometimes I feel my head will
explode like a football.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.120
And of course, there's the heartbreak too.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.240
Are you here to pass time?

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.600
No, it isn't that, doctor <i>saheb</i>.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.400
I'm Harshad Mehta.
I work in the share market.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.120
So?

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.560
So... the thing is, the relationship
between the share market...

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.360
...and union workers is like a woman's
relationship with her mother-in-law.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.040
Look... if the daughter-in-law does something good...

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.120
...her mother-in-law is happy.
The value goes up.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.120
If she stops doing chores,
mother-in-law gets angry and the value goes down.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.680
- And if she does something new...
- Get up.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.320
- What?
- Get up and get lost.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.240
- Get out!
- Doctor...

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.520
Your heartbreak is giving me a headache.
Get out.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.800
- Hey, send in the next. Go.
- Wait a minute.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.040
Doctor, listen to me.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.800
What I'm trying to say is,
the share price of the company increases...

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800
- ...when the production increases.
- Yes, so?

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.640
So, the thing is Doctor...
Premier has raised the price of its cars today.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.360
But the price and demand for its shares
has been increasing over the last seven days.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.760
Why? What do you think?

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.600
Who was behind this?
And who do you think benefitted?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.120
Did it help the worker?
Did it benefit you?

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.720
Just think. Nobody benefitted.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.200
I'm here to only discuss benefit
for the workers.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.800
I just want to know what's
going on in the factory.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.960
I mean, daily production details.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.080
Details regarding the increase in production...
impending strikes... that's it.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.440
Look, the market can be made to react
with this insider information.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.440
And I'll give you a part of the profit
that I make from this.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.120
I mean, it's for your labourers.
It'll go towards their fund.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.880
[Ashwin] 'Do you know what sort
of man this Dada Satam is?'

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.640
I don't think he'll agree
to what you've proposed.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.760
When it strikes his mind,
my phone will ring.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.680
I've given him my number.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.320
Look, everything has a price
and we have to pay this price.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.080
Hey, give me chopped salad.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.680
Listen to me... why are you getting
into insider trading?

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.880
If anything goes wrong...

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.880
...then people like Ambalal and Dada Satam
will chop you into a salad.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.840
Problems and hacks,
sweets and snacks...

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.880
...nobody can take these
away from a Gujarati.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.400
You are good at dialogues.
But it's risky.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.760
Risk is the spice of life.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.480

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.560
Harshad, I'm thinking of visiting
my village this weekend.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.240
We've made a lot of profit this time.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.640
This is not profit, it's called commission.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.440
- Profit goes to the Lala.
- Lala?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.200
- Your boss.
- Oh, Ambalal <i>Saheb</i>.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.480
Now, the name, the clients and profit,
all will be mine.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.120
It's time to open my own
trading account.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.920
And what about this job?

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.240
Do you think I was here to do a job?

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.920
I was here to learn.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.720
I've learnt enough.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.920
I've already spoken to Suresh <i>Bhai</i>.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.680
Suresh Nandlal Shah.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.320
My trading account will be open
in a few days.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.200
-[Harshad] 'Did you see that?'
- What?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.200
Special fabric from Patan.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.280
Bhushan <i>bhai</i>'s wife has sent it.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.000
What's up, Mr. Mehta?
You seem very happy today.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.240
I've quit my job.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.040
And you're happy about it?!

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.040
- I'm starting something of my own.
- What does that mean?

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.280
That means we're going to prosper.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.600
I'm not a jobber anymore.
I've opened my own trading account.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.880
I get that.
But what's the difference?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.880
It's very different.
Now all the money will be ours.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.880
What are you saying?
Tell me everything.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.880
A wife must know
what her husband does.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.600
You mean you want to tell
your parents?

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.320
Tell them Harshad's family
is going to prosper.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.400
Okay, don't tell me.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.920
So, if I tell you,
will you understand?

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.760
You can at least try.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.280
Come.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.960
Come here. Sit.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.960
Look. A jobber's work
is like a slow train.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.880
- A slow train stops at every station, right?
- Yes.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.760
Starts at the green signal
and stops at the red signal.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.200
Exactly like that...

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.760
...a jobber just follows orders.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.760
The broker says buy, and you buy.
The broker says sell, and you sell.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.360
And what do we get
after performing in this circus?

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760
Nothing but a <i>vaandha</i>.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.400
The boss and the broker
make all the profit.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.880
When we have our own trading account
watch how our life changes.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.960
The slow train
will turn into The Gujarat Express.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.560
We will invest our own money.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.960
We will take a position in the market,
then we will square it off ourselves.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.120
- Did you understand?
- Of course.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.480
A little bit.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.080
But if you had explained this lovingly
I would have understood it better.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.800
Is this much love enough?

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.440
- Where did this come from?
- It came from this decision.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.240
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.480
[murmur]

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.400
Who celebrates on quitting a job?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.800
I don't understand it.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.800
<i>Pappa</i>, what don't you
understand in the menu?

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.240
Not the menu. I don't understand you.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.320
Really? I'm so simple!

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.840
What are you saying?

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.120
Ignore him. You place the order.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.440
- Here...
- What I don't understand is...

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.280
...you have quit a well-paying job,
and you're wasting money here?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:05.960
Have you won a lottery?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.240
<i>Pappa</i>, this is bigger than a lottery.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.440
We've opened
our own trading account.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.840
- What do you mean "we"?
- We. Harshad and I.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.480
Even I've decided to quit my job
before marriage.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.880
What is happening?
Are we buying soap? Buy one, get one free!

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.520
You've both quit your jobs
and nobody's told me?!

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.960
Can someone explain
what's happening in this family?

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.680
What do you want to know?

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.480
We use our brains
to fill other pockets.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.080
How long will we keep doing this?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.360
If we are working hard
and applying our brains...

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.960
...we should be the ones
getting the profit, right?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.840
Son, if the profit is yours,
the loss will be yours too.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.320
Ask me, I have the experience.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.080
Even the textile market can't be trusted...

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.680
...and he is talking about
the share market.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.680
Order something sweet for him...

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.600
...so that he utters something sweet.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.320
Such bitter words!

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.200
They're on to something good.
If you can't wish them luck then...

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.080
Wishing luck doesn't bring profit
in a business.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.440
If I say this restaurant is good,
will I get free food?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.560
Hey... Waiter. Excuse me, please.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.840
Your restaurant is the best.
Very good. Number one.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.760
Now that I've praised your restaurant so much,
will I get to eat here for free?

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.880
<i>Bhai</i>, come, let's go home.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.120
- No... - Let's have dinner at home.
- Ignore him...

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.640
- He's ruined the mood.
- That's correct!

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.760
Save the money, you will need it.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800
What are you saying?
Place the order.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.520
- Sir, can I take your order?
- Sure, take it.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.960
A plate of wisdom,
a plate of smartness...

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.400
...and some responsibility.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.720
- Do you serve those?
- That's not on the menu.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.320
Then take it from her.
She has plenty.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.360
- Yes, I do.
- Wait a minute...

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.320
- Come here.
- Yes. Here, take this.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.000
- 5 rotis...
- One <i>khichdi</i> for me.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400
[Harshad] 'Yes,
get some hot <i>khichdi</i> for him.'

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.520
I knew you'd be the first one to
leave this place. I was right, wasn't I?

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.760
Who knew Ashwin would really get married?

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.480
This house is too small now.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.720
We've found a big house
in Kandivali for one and a half lakh rupees.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.840
We've bought it,
keeping the future in mind.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.640
You always think about the future.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.960
So, no more cricket and <i>Dandiya</i>?

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.600
Hey! I'm just changing homes
not friends.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.960
I'll come back to play <i>Dandiya</i>
and bowl you a googly.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.480
Will you have the time?

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.200
If you have time, come to my place
to learn about the share market.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.200
There you go again.
I don't understand shares.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.560
Why not? You're the first Gujarati
who hesitates to invest.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.480
Everything is risky.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.680
Once you learn, you can earn
your annual income in a month.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.560
- That's not possible.
- It is possible.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.680
Come home sometime.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.880
- I'll show you around and teach you about the share market.
- See you! Bye-bye.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.760
- Bye.
- Come on, let's go.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.080
Come on.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.720
- Tea.
- Give him some.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.120
He's newly married. Pamper
him for a year at least.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.400
<i>Bhabhi</i>, go, take rest.
This is your honeymoon period.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.240
Mr. Oversmart! Mind your own business.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.480
You both go on please.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.160
Anwar Pharma?
Which company is this?

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.800
It's Alwar Pharma.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.040
- <i>Bhabhi</i>, get him spectacles!
- Why are you investing in this company?

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.640
Did you get a tip?

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.360
No, but we have to create a tip
and spread that tip across the market.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.200
<i>Bhai</i>, this is like peanuts.
What tip is this stock worth?

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.280
- The share price is only five rupees.
- Exactly.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.280
Only five rupees. If we buy it
in bulk, the value will increase automatically.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.760
And if we spread a rumour about it,
the hungry dealers will act like a flock of sheep.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.200
At the right time, we'll dump the
shares and book a healthy profit.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.240
It sounds easy
but it's not practical.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.200
I know.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.560
Look, we have enough money
to buy only 20,000 shares.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.080
- Yes.
- If we get money to buy another 20,000...

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.320
...it'll be a feast for us!

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.040
Money for 20,000 more?
Who will give us the money?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.520
Nobody in the market
has lost their mind like you.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.200
- Anwar Pharma.
- It's Alwar Pharma!

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.280
Pranav <i>Bhai</i>.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.400
I'm Harshad Mehta.
I'm a broker.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.720
- So?
- I need to talk to you. Just 5 minutes.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.120
Not now. I'm not in the mood.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.160
Anyway, I can't smell anything.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.440
Hello, Pranav <i>Bhai</i>.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.960
- Smoking is not allowed here.
- I'm Harshad. We met yesterday?

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.360
- Yeah, so?
- Can we talk for five minutes?

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.800
See, if you can smell something.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.040
You asked for five minutes,
I'll answer in a second.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080
Not interested.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.080
- Pranav <i>Bhai</i>, listen to me.
- What can you tell me? Huh?

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.800
I can smell cash.
Notes attracts notes. And pennies attract pennies.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.400
Do you think my clients are so small
that they'll deal in pennies?

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.400
Tell me something, Pranav <i>Bhai</i>.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.680
Which is the most counterfeited
currency denomination in India?

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.960
- The 100 rupee note.
- No. Not the notes, it's the coins.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.640
25 paise, 50 paise, one rupee coins.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.240
Everyone focuses on the notes,
no one looks at the coins.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.560
Similarly, nobody looks at
the penny stocks.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.040
They're very easy to operate.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.400
And if we operate them properly,
profit is guaranteed.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.560
Operate? You want to operate stocks?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.280
Operating stocks is illegal.
You will end up in jail, get it?

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.680
Pranav <i>Bhai</i>,
just like you can smell currency notes...

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.160
...I hear the sound of wealth
in these jingling pennies.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.120
Just give it a try.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.880
Try?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.840
Do one thing.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.440
Take all of this and try it yourself.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.960
I don't want money.
Keep this.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.840
Let's do it together.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.600
Bloody hell!

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.040
In five minutes, you've gotten to
"Let's do it together"!?

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.080
What do you want to do?

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.520
Come to the ring today.
You'll see Alwar Pharma on the board.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.920
Alwar Pharma?

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.720
Harshad <i>Bhai</i> has
some inside information.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.960
Let's see what happens today.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.160
If Harshad <i>Bhai</i> is saying
then it must be definitely true.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.240
- Then buy some for me too.
- Okay.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.240
Listen, Harshad <i>Bhai</i> has a tip.
Alwar Pharma is going to surge...

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.240
It's fine even if it crosses the limit
by 25 or 30 per cent, get it?

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.640
Come on, go. Quick!

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.160
<i>Bhai</i>, you're sure this will work, right?

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.560
- Nothing will go wrong?
- Don't worry. Nothing will go wrong.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.320
How are you so sure it won't go wrong?

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.720
This is the first time
we're doing this.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.160
It won't be the last time,
trust me. Come.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.960
[Man1] 'Asian Cables 36.15, 39.20.'

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.640
'Ceat 107.68, 110.22'

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.040
'Crompton Greaves 91.38, 94.24'

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:21.840
'Tata Steel 234.12, 237.23.'

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.520
'Alwar Pharma 17.20, 20.'

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.240
Do you know who always wins?

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.200
The fastest one.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.920
History is witness. The cheetah always wins.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.440
Everyone bids on the horse.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.200
But the horse only runs.
Cheetah is the fastest.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.960
You were the cheetah
in the ring today.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.360
I have two more stocks in mind.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.360
Blowcast... and India Gears.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.080
Shall we go 50-50?

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.240
Done.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.480
That's not possible.
No company will shut down.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.080
[Man2] 'Oh, Harshad!'

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.720
'Harshad <i>Bhai</i>!'

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.200
Harshad <i>Bhai</i>.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.800
Wait. You've bought a new car!
Great!

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.400
- You're paying for our tea today.
- Yes.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.920
I pay for your tea every day.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.120
Forget tea.
Tell me what to buy today?

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.440
Buy any Tata share.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.360
Don't think so much.
It's an old company.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.760
Sooner or later, it is sure
to give you a profit.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.880
You're investing in new companies
and buying cars...

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.720
- ...and telling us to invest in old ones?
- That's true, Harshad <i>Bhai</i>.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.360
Fine, invest in the new ones like me.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.880
- But if you face a loss, it's on you. Okay?
- No! That's not fair.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.200
Brother, behind a large profit,
is also a large risk.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.400
If like me, you too love taking risks,
then take the plunge.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.960
You'll die or you'll fly.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.720
That's how new companies work.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.680
- 'The market has crashed...'
- Once it falls...

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.400
'The market has crashed...'

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.720
[crowd screaming]

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.320
Harshad, we've lost 10 lakhs!

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.600
Someone changed the game
in just half an hour.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.800
Someone has dumped 3.5 lakh
Reliance shares in the market.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.280
Who did this?
Is it Manu <i>Bhai</i>?

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.000
There is also heavy selling in Telco and Tisco.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.960
It's an eight to ten percent crash,
<i>Bhai</i>.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.160
People are saying that Calcutta Bears
have done this.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.760
- Someone named Ajay Makadia...
- Ajay Kedia!

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.400
Whoever the hell he is,
we're finished, <i>Bhai!</i>

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.440
Everything's over.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.280
Ten lakh rupees, <i>Bhai</i>.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.720
[Sucheta] <i>'That day, it seemed
as if Harshad's inning is over.'</i>

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.760
<i>'But the game had not even begun yet.'</i>

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.520
<i>'The end of his story,
was still a decade away.'</i>

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.440
-[DT] <i>'Hello?'</i>
-[Sucheta] <i>'Yeah, Sucheta here.'</i>

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.200
<i>'Listen we need to catch up
very urgently.'</i>

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.160
<i>'The source is right in front of me...'</i>

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.640
<i>'...and he's telling me that Harshad might be
in serious trouble with SBI.'</i>

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.720
<i>'I just need you to explain
a few technicalities to me, can we meet?'</i>

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.560
-[DT] <i>'Yeah, sure.'</i>
-[Sucheta] <i>'Thank you, I'll see you.'</i>

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.240
Where is the man
who was sitting here?

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.680
I brought tea for him.
I don't know where he's gone.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.840
Oh, no!
