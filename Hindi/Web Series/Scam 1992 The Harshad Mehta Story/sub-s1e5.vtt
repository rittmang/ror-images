00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.400
Sir, the people from Doordarshan
are here.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.280
They want your reaction
on the budget.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.480
- You want a reaction, right?
- Yes, sir.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.880
Sure, I'll give it. But...

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.880
...first, let's go outside.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.880
The weather is great today.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.240
- Come.
- Please.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.840
Check, one, two, three.
Am I audible?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.920
SBI is visible
in the background, right?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.200
Okay then. Let's start.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.680
Sir, this talk about a raid,
is it true?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.240
If I say yes, will you interview me
on that or on the budget?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880
No, sir. The interview will only be
on the budget.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.520
Then relax and take a deep breath.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.920
The wind is going to
change direction.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.200
No doubt, it's a great budget.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.680
The government is listening
to the market.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.080
'And mark my words.'

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.920
'Liberalisation is just the start.
It's just a beginning.'

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.600
'Now, India will rise too.'

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
'And stand proudly...'

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240
'...at par with the world'

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640
'People always ask me for tips
on investment.'

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.840
'Though I never give out
a tip for free...'

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
'...but because the market has opened today,
I'll give you an auspicious tip.'

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
'Invest in India.'

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.480
'Put your money on India.
Because India is going to scale new heights.'

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.360
[Reporter] 'Sir, you have brought about a
momentous rise in the stock market.'

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.000
'Do you think it will
explode after the budget?'

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.600
'Look, I don't smoke...'

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.640
'...But I always carry a lighter
in my pocket.'

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.040
'Just to cause an explosion.'

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
[Title Montage]

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680
Gentlemen.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.520
- The Sensex has crossed 3000 points.
-[applauds]

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.880
Let... Let me tell you what I think
about this personally.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.800
According to my experience...

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.320
...a boom like this
is highly speculative.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
So, I would advise institutions...

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.320
...to seriously think...

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.040
...of selling right now.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.480
I'm sure most of you would agree
that this is the right time...

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.760
...to book profits.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.920
And not just institutions...

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.160
...I would say the stock markets...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.360
...should take immediate steps
to cool down the market.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.640
Which has been overheated by...

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.760
...excessive speculation
on some shares.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.440
[applauds]

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.600
- 'Sir?'
- 'Hmm?'

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.680
Do you really think...

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.480
...the institutions
will listen to you?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.760
I mean, from what I hear...
There are rumours...

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.560
...that they only listen to
the stockbrokers and market players.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.440
Stockbroker?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.400
Yes, sir. Stockbroker,
to be precise just one person.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.760
One and only, The Big Bull.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.160
And what is SEBI doing about it?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.880
What can SEBI do, sir?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.680
They are just rumours.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.480
What can we do
without facts and proofs?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.320
What power does SEBI have?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.880
We're just a non-statutory body.
You know that.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.640
But sir...

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.360
...RBI has powers.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.800
Though you need not investigate
necessarily by the books.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.760
Anyway, who maintains the books
these days, sir? Nobody.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.920
See you.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320
Good morning, Sir.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
This way please.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.440
Ah!

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.120
So, they put us all
on the same flight, huh? Thats good.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.200
That was quite a speech out there.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.480
Oh!

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.680
You mustn't have liked it.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.600
After all, you are
our original Big Bull.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.480
I am observing this bull run
from a bull's perspective.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.920
The market believes in the government's
economic liberalisation policies.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.560
It just demonstrates that.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.640
This bull run is spontaneous.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.240
Right now, we shouldn't do anything
that can disturb the market.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.960
[Pherwani] 'And... you know I have been
in this market all my life.'

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.640
I've never seen the central bank
stepping in during a bull run.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.280
I partially agree with you.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.160
But this can only happen when the money
goes to the productive sector.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.160
[Venkitarajan ] 'With the current amount of speculation,
all the money is being sucked out of there.'

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.200
So, it makes perfect sense for the central bank
to step in and make enquiries.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.760
This too is for the good of the nation.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.280
-[Woman] 'Excuse me, sir.'
- Yeah?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.960
'I think you're in my seat.'

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.840
Really? I... I'm sorry.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.880
- I'm so sorry.
- 'That's okay.'

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.160
Hey! Tyagu! Thanks for coming.
Great to see you.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.040
I didn't see a Lexus
in the parking lot.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.320
I thought you would have
invited everyone.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.640
I did.
But apparently, he's busy.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.320
Ashwin was supposed to come,
but I don't see him either.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.720
- Good evening.
- Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.960
Oh!

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.880
So, which stocks are you playing with?
Or shall I say, hustling?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.960
Tip.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.240
There are only two gems
in the market.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.720
Polo and ACC.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.920
And let me guess, Mr. Maheshwari.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.320
You are short on both, right?

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.360
I don't see any other way.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.840
Polo has a P/E of 70 and ACC, 85.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.920
At a P/E of 40,
we should sell a stock.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.520
I have no idea why anybody would
be long on those.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.920
They are truly overpriced, I believe.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.680
A high P/E scrip will earn you
more money than a low P/E scrip.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.600
According to Harshad, of course.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.200
Which means, R. K.,
your theory is obsolete.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.280
Oh, yes.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.120
Forget him.
He talks rubbish.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.160
He can even make a deaf man's
ears bleed.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.120
He thinks he's
the rockstar of the market.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.360
He walks around with
a bodyguard, my friend.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.440
Forget a rockstar, he thinks he is
no less than Bachchan.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.720
'Seems like everybody
is missing Harshad.'

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.120
He seems to be the hot
topic of the party.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.920
Actually, we were missing you.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.400
We were just discussing...

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.960
...Harshad's stock market
theories.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.800
What theories?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.200
Every morning he makes up a new theory...

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.800
...and feeds it to everyone
from the media to the market...

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.480
...and pushes the market up by
channelizing illegal funds.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.680
Right.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.440
But he will fall.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.160
Both he and the market, will fall.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.680
This can't be sustained.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.440
Even the RBI governor was talking
about it the other day.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.040
And see. After he spoke about it...

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.000
...the market did fall
by 400 points in two days?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.200
But not enough,
it needs to correct more.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.520
Look, we have been holding our short
positions for the past six months.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.040
If this bull run continues
for one more month...

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.360
...we'll be left with nothing.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.240
We're facing losses daily.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.240
We can't take it anymore.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.840
If this goes on any longer...

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.080
...we'll have to sell ourselves
in the red light district.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.920
If you don't get a place there
you can come here...

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.400
...to Sonagacchi.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.080
But hey listen, on a serious note,
you must talk to the RBI governor.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.600
They should try to find out
what's going on.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.240
All of Harshad's sources are dubious.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.120
He's a bloody street-seller.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.080
Sir, I am glad you are taking
an active interest in the market.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.240
Your speech has made a great impact
in the market.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440
Yeah, I know.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.200
Our responsibility is towards
the small retail investors.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.040
'They are the most vulnerable.'

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.480
'The present trends
are misleading for them.'

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.320
When the bubble bursts...

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.400
...there will be blood
on the streets.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.760
True.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.600
I've no idea what's going on.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.120
On one hand, these illegal activities
in the money market...

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.520
...and on the other,
the stock market boom.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.920
[Venkitarajan ] 'There is no money
in the system.'

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.920
And yet, Harshad continues to
buy shares worth crores.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.240
Tell me...

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.680
What are Harshad's sources of funds?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.880
Rumour says it could be anything.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.120
'Smugglers, film stars,
drug lords, underworld.'

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.800
I doubt it's any of that.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.480
A few days back, there was
an income tax raid at Harshad's place.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.240
You can speak to them if you want.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.080
They may have found something.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.480
Sir, he knew everything.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.200
Everything. When, where, how...

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.280
Which route
we were coming by...

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.200
I mean, he also knew how many
potholes we would cross.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.760
He had arranged South-Indian
snacks for us.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.720
Obviously, we weren't going
to find any documents.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.800
He had hidden everything
before we reached.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.800
And when our team reached Growmore...

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.200
...they were told that
all the documents are in the computer.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.480
But nobody knew the password.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.640
And the computer operator
was on leave.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.920
His father conveniently died
the same day.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.600
So he had gone to his village.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.960
And hasn't come back
to Bombay ever since.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.800
I don't think he's coming back.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.400
Exactly, sir.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.160
That's why, we've called in an expert
from Coimbatore to crack it.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.680
But he's saying that
it will take some more time.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.720
There must be some way
to find the source of his funds.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.640
I mean, any physical evidence or...

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.160
There must be something?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.440
Nothing as of now, sir.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.680
But his SBI account.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.680
There's a lot of activity in that.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.800
A lot of money is coming in.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.200
So, if we can trail the money,
I think we can find the real source.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.760
Alright.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.560
- Keep me regularly updated on this.
- Sure, sir.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.160
Even if the information seems useless...

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.240
- ...I still want a regular update.
- Yes, sir.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.440
Keep me posted.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.160
Sir... Are you leaving, sir?

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.440
- What happened? Anything urgent?
- Sir, uh...

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.800
- Uh... Leave the bag in the car.
- Yes, sir.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.600
- Yeah. What is it? Anything urgent?
- Sir, you had asked SBI Bombay...

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.720
...main branch to send the details
of Harshad Mehta's current account.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.800
Sir, we just got the statement.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.920
- And?
- Sir...

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.560
I think you should
see it yourself, sir.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.560
- Oh, God! Okay.
- Sir... Thank you, sir.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.960
This is startling.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.520
So much movement in an
individual's current account?

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.000
Sir, 30 to 40 crores are like loose change.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.720
All transfer entries are in crores.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.120
Sir, 9th March balance was...
This one, sir... 186 crores.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.880
Goiporia knows?

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.880
[Ghosh] 'Sir, he's the chairman of SBI.'

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.520
He's getting the vouchers
scrutinised tomorrow.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.560
Then, these funds...

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.760
...from where they're coming,
and where they're going...

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.760
...we'll know everything.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.120
Listen... Listen, Amitav.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.400
Our officers should also scrutinize
these entries.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.760
- Do this parallelly. This is top priority.
- Sir.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.640
I'd like to share this statement
with the finance minister.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520
Secondly...

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.600
Send a note to Goiporia.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.560
Tell him to put Harshad's account
under constant monitoring.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.440
Hello, how are you, Amrik brother?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.640
All okay?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.400
Didn't I tell you
that Polo is going to rock?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.560
I hope your father is happy now?

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.280
He's happy, Harshad Bhai.
But like I said, he's a little old school.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.800
He's worried that...
Seeing such a rise...

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.640
...won't investors start
asking questions?

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.840
Bhai, People only question
when they face losses.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.720
Nobody asks anything when
they are making profits.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.360
And people haven't even seen
the real rise yet.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.920
Ask your father to relax.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.040
Okay, listen. I'll be in Delhi,
next week.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.000
Let's chat more
once we meet?

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.880
Sure, we'll be waiting.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.640
Okay, Jai Shree Kri...
Sat Sri Akaal.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.680
Sat Sri Akaal, talk to you soon.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.280
Come on.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.960
Swim without the floater.
Come on!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.320
[phone ringing]

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.720
Hello?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.320
Sir?

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.360
Sir, he says it's important.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.400
So annoying!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.880
- Hello?
- Hello, sir. It's Sitaraman.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.840
Tell me, Sita's Raman!
To what do I owe this pleasure?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.160
[Sitaraman] 'Sir...
Sorry to disturb you.'

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.880
But it's urgent, sir.
There's a problem.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.000
Do you get a salary for worrying
or doing your job?

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.240
You're always high on worry.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.040
[Sitaraman] 'Sir, there's
a reason to worry.'

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.360
Goiporia sir has called
for your statements.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.880
[Sitaraman] 'I heard that the
order came directly from RBI.'

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.440
'Sir, what if they get to know?
I'm feeling very worried, sir.'

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.680
Please settle all our accounts
as soon as possible. Please.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.520
'If they come to know...'

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.200
Sir.
I'm feeling very afraid, sir.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.400
- Hey, Pappa!
-[Sitaraman] 'Hello, sir?'

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.640
- Did you see? I just swam four laps.
-[Sitaraman] 'Hello, sir?'

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.440
You never see what's
in front of you.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.600
Forget it.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.360
Why don't you answer?

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.080
[Harshad] 'Am I new
to this business?'

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.920
Is this the first time
I'm asking you for a roll-over?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.800
How can it be rolled over, sir?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.800
This time, it's very difficult.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.800
A hawk's eye is on your account, sir.
Every page is being scrutinised.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.280
- And sir...
- I know, tomorrow is the expiry date.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.960
That's what I'm saying, sir.
Tomorrow is the expiry date.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.800
It's an entry of 170 crores.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.920
You haven't even given me the BRs.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.800
I'm very scared, sir.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.800
What if someone comes to know?
I'm getting heartburn just thinking of it.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.760
Then burp and move on, Sitaraman ji.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.440
Sir, I don't care.
I want 170 crores right now. That's it.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.120
- 170 crores?
- Yes, sir.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.240
- In one day?
- Yes, sir.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.800
- Has your brain curdled?
- Ye...

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.840
- No, sir.
- Bhushan, calm down.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.800
How can I keep calm?

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.080
[Bhushan] 'If we pull it out from the market
then we'll be in deep shit.'

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.440
Our a**e will look like
a cave, brother!

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.080
[Bhushan] 'This is not the time
to dole money out, you know it well.'

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.760
Sensex has dropped by 400 points
because of this Venkitarajan .

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.040
It has gone from 3500 to 3100.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.200
Brother, come up with some other plan
for this 170 crores, that's it.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.560
Sir, the 170 crores is nothing.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.400
What if this 170 crores
leads them to those 500 crores?

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.200
- Sir... Sir, please try to under...
- I know.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.160
I know I took it last year.
Calm down.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.800
You will get your 170 crores.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.240
But the 500 crores, must stay
out of the books.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.840
- Out of the books?
- Yes.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.720
I will handle the PDO.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.760
- You wanted to hold your son's
tonsuring ceremony, right? - Huh?

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.640
- Yes.
- You wanted to go, right?

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.560
Did you get leave?

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.440
- Yes.
- Great. Where are you going?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.360
- Palani, near Coimbatore.
- Wow!

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.600
So, go by air. You and your family.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.400
- Bhushan?
- Yes?

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.520
[Harshad] 'Arrange for his travel
and stay.'

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.600
Yeah, sure.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.680
Have fun!

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.840
Hey, Chavan.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.000
The office has closed
and you're eating now!

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.800
Hey, Sitaram have a seat.
Come, eat with us.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.240
No, thanks. You go on.
I have some work.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.160
I have to make an entry
in the ledger.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.120
- Okay, I'll come with you.
- No...

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.920
You please eat.
I'll manage.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.440
- No, that's okay. I'll come.
- No, please sit.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.520
- No problem...
- Sure?

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.480
- Sure. Sit...
- Okay.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.680
Thank you...

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.600
Okay, tell me something.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.760
Why is the RBI Governor...

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.880
...shoving his horns
into the share market like a bull?

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.880
He can shove them wherever he wants.
But why is he butting into my SBI account?

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.760
He's only entered the account now.
Soon he will be up our a**.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.480
- Why are you cussing at home?
- Because this time it is serious.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.920
You've gone mad for money.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.640
You keep chanting 'money, money, money...'
all the time.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.480
If not from here then from there,
if not there then elsewhere.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.560
How much will you
hustle, Harshad?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.960
In trying to save one,
you'll break at a hundred more.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.840
I had warned you.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.040
Harshad, you've become so big
that now, big people are after you.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.240
- Do you get that?
- I get everything.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.440
If you get it, then before it's too late,
settle everything Bhai.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.520
You think you're digging a gold-mine.
But it can turn into your grave.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.120
Do you realise?

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.760
Hey, Shashi Kapoor, calm down.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.960
Calm down. That's not how it works.
Wait.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.320
Do one thing, go meet
the RBI governor.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.040
Speak with him.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.080
Try to read what's on his mind.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.720
- Simple.
- Simple!

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.240
He's just waiting with a bouquet
to welcome us, isn't he?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.800
If he's not, then we will make him.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.600
We'll get friends in
Delhi to call him.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.560
I'll have some jalebis.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.240
[Harshad] 'Look, sir.
Believe me...'

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.800
...India's foreign
and domestic debt problem...

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.760
...can only be solved by the capital markets
and direct portfolio investments.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.920
Mr. Mehta, I've heard about your
multiple theories.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.240
But this is exceptionally wrong.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.720
Incorrect. Absolutely incorrect.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.520
Longterm securities can be created
on the balance of payments front...

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.280
...only when the economy
grows exponentially.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.920
[Venkitarajan ] 'Or...'

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.480
'...when forex-guzzling expenditure
like petroleum import is reduced.'

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.520
- You get my point?
- I absolutely get your point.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.000
But if you just give me two hours...

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.280
...I will explain you everything
point by point.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.720
[Harshad] 'You see even
Mr. Krishnamurthy liked my ideas.'

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.360
Oh, yes! He was in awe of you.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.440
Almost forced me to meet you.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.560
I couldn't refuse. After all he is
a member of the planning commission.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.960
[Harshad] 'That's really kind of you,
sir.'

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.320
I am sure that I can
convince you a 100 percent.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.440
Just give me two hours.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.560
Mr. Mehta, I'd...

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.600
...love to give you two hours
to listen to you and...

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.760
...ten more minutes
to prove you wrong.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.800
But frankly...

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.760
...I don't want to waste
my time or yours.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.800
Is there anything else, Mr. Mehta?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.920
I have a request.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.400
- If you could talk to SBI...
- What should I talk to SBI about?

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.480
They listen only to you these days,
don't they?

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.760
And they are really being
difficult with me now.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.960
Because they are getting all
the instructions from your office.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.600
Mr. Mehta, I am really getting late
for my next meeting.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.040
So, if you could kindly excuse me.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.480
Goodbye.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.760
- 'Sir?'
-[Khemani] 'Yes, tell me.'

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.840
We thought this might be
a regular calculation error.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.000
It happens, during
the reconciliation.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.160
But sir, this time it's not a small error,
it looks like a big one.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.720
Can you please elaborate?

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.680
Sir, look at this.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.840
Our books show...

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.560
...securities
worth 1744 crores.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.880
[Khemani] 'Wait a minute...'

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.000
- How much do our books show?
-[Kamat] '1,744 crores.'

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.240
- 1744 crores?
- Yes.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.840
And the RBI statement
sent by the PDO...

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.960
[Kamat] '...those records show that we have securities
worth only 1,670 crores.'

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.080
1,670.
So, there's a difference of 74 crores.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.080
Sir, this 74 crore difference...

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.560
...we thought it was a calculation error
and checked the accounts...

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.320
We were trying to figure it out,
but...

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.480
But what?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.960
RBI's figure is not 1,670 crores.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.640
- It's 1,170 crores.
- 1,170...

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.400
- 1,170?
-[Kamat] 'Yes.'

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.760
Sir, this is not a calculation error.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.920
574 crores are missing
from our accounts.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.840
- What?
- 'Yes, sir.'

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.760
But this statement has come
from PDO, right?

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.080
-[Kamat] 'Yes.'
- Show me.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.400
1,670. It's written right here.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.320
[Kamat] 'Sir, look at it carefully.'

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.520
'Here. 'One' has been overwritten
to make it look like a 'Six'.'

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.480
'See.'

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.800
Sitaraman?

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.280
Sir, he's the one who
brought the files from RBI.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.040
[mumbling] Five hundred crore is a big sum.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.200
So, does Sitaraman have Bank Receipts
or securities against this?

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.920
- Yes or no?
- 'Sir...'

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.760
Kamat?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.800
Not sure, sir.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.520
Sitaraman is on leave since yesterday.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.600
Actually sir, it's his son's tonsure ceremony.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.600
'So, he's gone to Palani,
near Coimbatore.'

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.920
Spare me the details.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.560
Go immediately. Check his desk,
cupboards, files... everything.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.800
If you have to break the locks,
do it. Go!

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.560
Okay, sir.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.880
Hit it with the rod.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.080
- Yeah, like that.
- Hit it.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.600
[Kamat] 'Ah, yes.'

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.720
What happened?

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.200
- Did you find anything?
- No sir, nothing yet.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.880
Come with me.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.320
Is sir in?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.600
- He just left.
- Where did he go?

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.800
Downstairs. He just left.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.360
Sir! Sir! Sir!

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.400
- Where the hell is Sitaraman?
- He's gone to the village.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.920
He's on leave. We even broke his locker.
But nothing...

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.240
I'm afraid, it's a clear case
of fraud, sir.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.000
F**k!

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.320
Has anyone spoken to him?

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.320
- No.
- Let's not panic right now, Khemani.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.800
First, bring him back.
This Sitaraman, he works under you, right?

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.160
Cancel his leave.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.480
Sir, he's in Palani, near Coimbatore.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.280
- It's his son's tonsure...
- Palani or Paris. I don't care.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.120
Bring him back.
He's your responsibility.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.640
Should we inform chairman sir?

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.520
We need all the other details
before that.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.400
First priority is Sitaraman.
Okay?

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.160
Please leave right now!

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.600
[phone ringing]

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.240
Hello?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.520
Ah, thank you.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.160
[Krishnan]
'Rajan. Our security officer, sir.'

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.520
'His team has been looking for Sitaraman
since yesterday, sir.'

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.840
- Did you find him?
- No, sir. - No, sir.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.200
But don't worry, sir.
Lord Murugan is with us.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.720
[Krishnan chanting mantra]

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.440
Let's do one thing.
Let's trap him at the temple.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.200
[temple bell chiming]

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.360
[temple music playing]

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.360
Sir!

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.360
S-Sir...

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.200
You came, sir!

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.160
I invited the entire office, sir...

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.360
...but only you came.
Thank you so much, sir.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.280
I have come alone, for now.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.040
Everyone else is
waiting for you in Bombay.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.360
Do one thing. Leave this here
and come with me. I need to talk to you.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.680
- Right now, sir?
- Yes, keep it. Come.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.560
Keep it. Come.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.800
Take his family to the hotel.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.440
-[Krishnan] 'Okay, sir.'
-[Kamat] 'Bhabhi ji, we'll be back.'

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.120
- 'Come on, Sitaraman.'
-[Sitaraman] 'Sir...'

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.160
Sir, they are packing.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.520
Packing, sir?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.440
What happened, sir?

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.760
You've come all the way...

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.320
- Any problem?
- Any problem!?

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.400
Was I bitten by a mad dog, to follow you
all the way here, without a problem?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.360
What problem, sir?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.840
Five hundred crores.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.240
Oh. Sir, that 500 crore
is no problem at all, Sir.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.600
I have a complete record
of it, sir.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.400
Accounts, details, everything, sir.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.800
Actually, I left in a hurry because of
my son's ceremony. So, I forgot.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.960
- I will manage it once I return...
-[chair screeching]

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.240
- You forgot?
- Sorry, sir.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.720
You forgot to account for 500 crores!?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.080
Very sorry, sir.
I will manage, sir.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.520
- What will you manage?
- I...

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.800
Huh?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.160
I didn't mean that, sir.
By manage, I mean...

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.920
-[chair screeching]
- It's... I...

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.040
- I was on leave...
- Leave?

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.760
Forget your leave, okay?

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.600
I'll be back on Thursday, sir.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.680
I have flight tickets
from Madras. With family...

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.400
We will also take you by flight.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.040
You and your family.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.120
Get ready.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.080
No, sir.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.520
I'm very sorry...

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.040
...But, I don't have the SGL, sir.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.920
Sit here.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.840
Sit!

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.720
He told Kamat yesterday
that he has the SGL.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.680
Hmm?

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.600
Did you or didn't you?

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.200
- Did you or didn't you?!
- I did, Sir.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.960
- Then?
- But, I was really scared then, sir.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.760
- Also, my family was with me...
- Your family isn't here right now.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.080
Tell me clearly.
Why don't you have the SGL?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.960
Look, Sitaraman. We're not talking
about 500 rupees.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.200
Five hundred crores are missing
from our books.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.960
You can go to jail for this.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.680
And once you go to jail,
they'll beat you black and blue.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.120
BRs are there, sir.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.480
What?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.560
BRs.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.720
Speak clearly!

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.560
BRs are there, sir.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.280
[Khemani] 'BRs are there?'

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.440
Sitaraman, why didn't you say
that all this while?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.680
Have you stuffed
something in your mouth?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.400
You could've said this earlier.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.120
Kamat?

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.040
You collect all the BRs
from him, immediately.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.000
- Right sir. Come on.
- BRs are not with me, sir.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.000
I'll give you one tight slap!

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.920
Are you on drugs?

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.560
He just said, didn't he...

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.200
You just said... five seconds back...

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.840
...that you have the BRs.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.240
Are you okay? Huh?

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.760
Sitaraman.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.120
Are you feeling fine?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.080
BRs are there, sir.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.280
But they are not with me.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.400
[Sudhakar] 'Whom are they with?'

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.440
Harshad Mehta.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.760
Some plants need more water.
Like those ones.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.880
Go and water them.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.280
There. Right there.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.400
- Good morning, sir.
- Hello, sir.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.800
Harshad?

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.200
Yes, sir.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.920
Securities were supposed
to come from PNB.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.600
So why didn't they come?

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.240
No. That's what Harshad had told...

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.600
- ...to Sitaraman...
- To hell with Sitaraman.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.400
Did you speak with PNB directly?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.280
- We spoke to... and...
- And?

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.600
Sir, the money never reached PNB.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.280
- So, why would they give...?
- It never reached?

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.360
I don't understand.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.760
- [Khemani] 'Actually, sir...'
-[Khemani clears throat]

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.720
The cheques were issued
in Mr. Mehta's name.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.720
[Khemani] 'He took the money from us,
but didn't give it to them.'

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.240
So, we didn't receive the securities.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.840
And that's the reason, sir...

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.320
...we are short on 500 crore rupees.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.000
[Sudhakar] 'We're doing
an internal enquiry sir. But...'

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.120
...the priority is that we should
recover the money from Harshad.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.360
Sir, I think, you should
speak with him.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.680
I mean, if you speak...

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.400
- Khemani...
- ...it will build some pressure...

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.160
Khemani, look at me.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.440
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.520
- No, sir. I was saying...
- Do I look like...

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.520
...a recovery agent to you, Khemani?
Tell me...

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.200
- No sir, what I meant to say...
- Shut up, Khemani.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.400
I am the chairman of
the largest bank in this country.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.120
[Khemani] 'Yes, sir.'

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.280
I deal directly with the government
on the finance policy.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.920
Yes, sir.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.320
[Goiporia] 'I deal directly
with the finance minister.'

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.960
And today, you are telling me
to deal with some middle-man...

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.320
...who has shown you
the middle finger?

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.440
Khemani, you created this mess,
you handle it.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.080
[Harshad] 'It's simple, sir.
I took the BRs from Sitaraman.'

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.840
Obviously, so that
I can get SGL from PNB.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.400
- And what happened then?
- What happened?

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.920
I reached office with the BRs
but the IT guys did a raid there.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.480
They came with a huge squad.
It's all still sealed.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.400
Circumstances are such, that though
I have BRs, I can't do anything.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.840
So what if you've been raided?

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.520
What does SBI have to do with it?

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.000
We have to follow the rules, don't we?

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.880
I want my books to be clean,
Mr. Mehta.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.600
[knock on the door]

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.600
What is it? Who called for tea?

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.800
[Peon] 'Sir, I saw sir here.
So, I thought...'

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.120
Keep it here, buddy.
Here.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.280
[Harshad] 'Do you have
those cashew cookies?'

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.840
[Peon] 'Yes, sir.'

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.240
- Bring those also.
- 'In a minute, sir.'

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.280
Sir, I know my books very well.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.320
And you know,
in the last five years...

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.320
...SBI and I have done
lots of business together.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.080
17,000 crores. It's not a
small amount, sir.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.520
Huh?

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.200
And how much profit did
SBI make from it?

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.760
At least 200 crores?

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.040
Now suddenly you're saying that
I will disappear with your 500 crores?

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.320
Come on, sir. You know me.
I'm an honest man.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.240
What do I do
with your honesty?

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.160
Can I write on my statement..?
'Mr. Mehta is an honest person.'

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.360
Let's make it very clear, Mr. Mehta.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.240
Either give me the BRs
or the securities.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.800
Or else, return
the entire amount immediately.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.120
Okay, let's say I'm the bad guy.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.080
But you're a good man, right?

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080
Then be good.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.360
Give me one week.
I'll settle everything.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.440
[Peon] 'Sir.'

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.760
Buddy, SBI's tea
was very bitter today.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.040
Ask them to add some sugar.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.520
Drive me home, buddy.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.040
'Harshad is home.'

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.960
'Will you eat, son?'

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800
Harshad.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.920
Don't just sit silently,
Bhai.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.160
Talk to me.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.160
Tell me in detail.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.440
What should I tell you?

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.240
If I say anything,
you'll start lecturing me again.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.360
You relax. I'm figuring it out.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.000
Look, Bhai.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.480
I know I got very angry
the other day.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.040
But that wasn't my anger.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.720
It was my fear.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.840
Okay forget that. Tell me.
how much time have you bought?

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.280
A week.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.040
Only a week?

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.240
On one hand, this IT raid.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.520
And on the other,
that RBI Governor.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.840
Now, a new problem
with SBI.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.920
And, all of it just when...

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.440
...we need money to
keep the market up.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.240
When your luck is bad, you can lose
a fight even to a monkey.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.800
It's not just one monkey this time.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.600
- It's an army of monkeys, Harshad.
- No.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.600
Not the monkeys,
it's an army of bears.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.680
Those bloody bears are after me.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.240
But that's okay.
We are just as strong.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.840
Like Hanuman.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.160
If they set fire to my tail,
I will set their kingdom ablaze.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.120
Aren't you asleep?

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.000
Go to sleep
or you'll get dark circles.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.320
You're also awake, aren't you?

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.960
I'm just lying down.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.040
[Jyoti sighs]

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.960
Did you forget?

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.000
'Never lie to the night.'

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.840
'The night holds all our secrets.'

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.160
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.320
I like you a lot.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.120
Really?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.800
Swear on your market?

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.600
AK, I've found out
from my sources.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.720
This SBI matter is serious.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.440
Harshad could be in a big soup.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.200
And the amount is 500 crores.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.200
And what is SBI doing
about it?

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.440
He has been given a deadline
to return all the money.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.800
[Ajay] 'Five hundred crores?'

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.240
The market will not open for
a few days because of the strike.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.000
[Tyagi] 'Yeah'.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.280
He can't get the money
by trading there...

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.600
...because he can't trade there.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.880
I think this is the time
to strangle him.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.040
You think he will come to you?

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.600
He has to.
Who else can he go to?

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.400
Who else will give him 500 crores?

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.120
Nobody has the capacity
to buy his holdings.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.080
He'll have to sell them all to us.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.840
And at the price that we quote.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.560
He asked for one more week...

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800
...and he got it.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.200
Now what?

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.560
Do you know
what we are being made to look like?

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.240
Bloody fools. What do we do now?

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.040
We should file
an official police complaint, sir.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.760
Shut up, Khemani.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.600
I will talk to Harshad.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.440
You're just wasting time.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.560
There won't be any settlement
between SEBI and the brokers.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.280
This strike will go on
for a few days more.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.440
Look...

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.000
Stopping doesn't mean
you've given up.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.880
The solution for SBI
is right in front of you.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.640
You have so many holdings.
Sell them and get rid of the problem.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.320
-[Pranav] 'It's simple.'
- Pranav is right.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.720
That Goiporia has been continuously
threatening to tell RBI.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.000
He won't even open his mouth.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.840
If he does,
SBI will also be in a soup.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.280
[Ashwin] 'What do we care
what happens to SBI?'

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.240
The further we get caught up in this,
the more trouble we'll be in.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.600
You know what?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.600
I will talk to Tyagu.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.080
A bit of spit and polish.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.520
And, he'll give you a fair deal.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.320
He won't give a fair deal,
he'll give a f**ked deal.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.960
- I will never go to Citibank.
- Let's go to someone else.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.840
How about SBI Capital Markets?

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.040
Let's sell our holdings to them
and square off our position with SBI.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.600
- What do you say?
- You're right.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.080
What's right about this?
Sell everything?

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.600
And what about
the capital gains tax?

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.040
The IT department
is already up our noses.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.680
I won't let them make a penny
out of me.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.400
Forget pennies.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.360
We're talking about 500 crores.
Do you even understand?

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.920
- Hari Om, Swami ji.
-[Swami] 'Hari Om.'

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.520
You had asked me to call.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.840
We have debated your problem.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520
Don't worry.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.600
[Swami] 'Your work will be done.'

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.640
- But, how?
- National Housing Bank.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.520
[swami] 'Your solution lies there.'

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.920
National Housing Bank?

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.520
Do you know who
the chairman is?

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.400
Pherwani. I know.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.800
Pherwani and I don't get
along at all, Swami ji.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.760
When he was in UTI, he didn't
give me a penny's business.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.280
He runs away on hearing my name.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.480
[Swami] 'It's a difference
of opinions.'

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.240
'We'll clear out
your differences.'

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.560
Hari Om, Swami ji.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
[Swami] 'Hari Om.'

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680
Hari Om.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.640
[Pherwani exhaling]

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.880
I knew... this is where I would
see the real bull-run.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.000
Can I finish my run?

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.520
Everyone is running.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.800
What's important is...
where do they want to reach?

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160
Mr. Mehta...

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.640
Can I jog?
We'll meet sometime later?

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.880
I think your run will only stop
once you have reached Delhi.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.680
I was there, the other day.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.360
Teen Murti Bhavan, Delhi.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.120
I had a chat with Swami ji.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.640
You also must have?

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.760
Manohar Jagmohandas Pherwani.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.320
Member of Parliament. M.P.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.400
Sounds good, sir.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.080
Look as closely as you want.
Maximum payment has been made.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.320
Only six crores remain,
and you'll get that soon too.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.480
Happy?

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.680
[Harshad] 'You panic for no reason.'

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.600
I suggest, go on a picnic.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.000
Let poor Sitaraman
also take a vacation.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.760
[Harshad] 'Business is
religion to me, sir.'

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.760
'And the God of this religion
is Trust.'

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.120
A close friend once told me...

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.960
..."the most expensive thing
in the world is trust".

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.080
Cheap people can't afford it.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.880
What took so long
in bringing the tea?

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:22.960
Please have, sir.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.800
It is sweet today, right?

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.640
[cars honking]

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.400
I had asked you to
bring the driver along.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.160
But no.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.240
How much will you honk?

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.200
I am taking you for a drive,
not the driver.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.280
Then, stop honking.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.120
That's how it is these days.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.560
There's always a noise
in my head...

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.720
...I can't even spend
a few hours with you in peace.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.480
Thankfully, the noise
of your share market...

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.040
...doesn't reach our ears.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.200
That's good.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.040
Your dad is right.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.560
I've been so busy with my work,
I've forgotten the taste of family life.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.200
You've been taking advice
from my dad, haven't you?

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.960
[Harshad chuckles]

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.000
Wasn't it his idea,
to take me out for a play?

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.360
Yes.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.240
That's why you are taking me.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560
I don't want to go.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.440
Actually, I don't need to
watch this play at all.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.680
The biggest drama queen
is sitting right beside me.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.160
[Harshad chuckles]

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.640
We won't be able to
see it, anyway.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.480
Late entry is not allowed.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.600
And we are not going to make it
on time.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.120
Everything is allowed
in Harshad's reign. Do you get it?

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.680
Harshad's rule, right!

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.960
We'll make it.

- 'Dad.'
- 'So. Talk to him.'

'Not my dad. Your wife's dad.'

'You mean, Babulal?
My father-in-law?'

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.120
- Yes.
- Don't take his name!

No return, and no dividend.'

By investing in someone like you.'

'Poor man. He misheard.
Your name is Bakul.'

That's why he made a mistake'

that I am not the Big Bull.'

'He's still on the phone.
What do I tell him?'

'Tell that Babulal,
That the market is on a high.'

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.120
'But his share has dropped
to the ground.'

'But where did he get
the funds to repay?'

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.760
The market is on strike.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.400
Someone would have known if he
had done such a big deal elsewhere.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.040
My sources are trying to find out.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.720
But he hasn't returned
all the money yet.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.520
SBI is silent on the matter.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.080
Obviously, because
he's returning the money.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.160
The matter will
be forgotten soon.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.760
But what if this news
were to get leaked?

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.400
He's taken 500 crore rupees
from SBI without any BRs or SGL.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.360
And now, he's returning the money
because he's been exposed.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.520
It's not a small matter, AK.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.280
He has conned SBI. It's a fraud.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.120
And sooner or later, Harshad
will have to face the music.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.800
He can even go behind bars.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.360
If this news gets leaked...

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.760
...the entire market will be shaken.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.240
