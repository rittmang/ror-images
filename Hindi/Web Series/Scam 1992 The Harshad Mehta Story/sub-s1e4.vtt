Why didn't you order anything?

No... I didn't think
you would be coming, so...

Yet... here I am.

No, thank you. I don't want anything.

I'm curious about something else.

We were going through
an economic crisis.

What are you trying to insinuate?

I'm not a very big fan
of Mr. Mehta.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.640
Then you are an exception.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Because the people
of your fraternity...

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.440
...have declared him
the greatest scholar in the market.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
[DT] 'Some even think that he
should be the finance minister.'

Mr. Mehta can surely
become a minister.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.280
He is always delivering speeches.

his theories are just rubbish.

Nobody cares what you and I think.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.160
Right now, money is flowing
into the market...

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.320
...and everyone is taking a dip
in this river.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.720
But no one cares
where the source of this river is.

Where is all this money
coming from?

You know, lots of people think
it's the underworld?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.520
Baseless theories.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.240

[glass and ashtray clanking]

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.280
Harshad doesn't need...

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.800
...the underworld or political
parties to fund him.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.960
He has the government in his
pocket.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.800
He makes one phone call,
and his friends in Delhi...

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.320
...instruct all
government institutions...

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360
...to provide him with
all the funds he wants.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.440
Do you have any proof for this?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.680
No.
But I know it for sure.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.080
Last time, I tried
to reach out to you...

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.720
...because I was doing a story on
the irregularities in the money market.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.520
But you seem to be interested
only in Harshad Mehta.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.680
Yes.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.000
Because in money market also,
everything is going haywire.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.520
All the financial institutions
and banks are under Harshad's control.

He is cornering all the securities
and taking positions in the market.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.600

...nothing else matters.

Not your merit, not your skill.
Nothing.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.600
The only thing that matters is...

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.880
...how much you can grease the palms
of these bank officials.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.200
Because Harshad is very good at it.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.920
He does it, so we are
also compelled to do it.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.840
If we don't keep the bank officials happy...

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.800

little business that we do.

against Mr. Harshad Mehta...

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.880
...then I will need solid evidence.

I can't do anything against him...

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.040

to expose his modus operandi.

There's no doubt about it.

See, when I said that you are
undervaluing your company...

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.040
...what I meant is...

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.840
...that you should not value your company
only on the basis of what it earns.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.920
Tell me. When did you commence
your business?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.280

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.160
That's 19 years. Long time.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.960
You've invested a lot.

- Please.
- Thanks.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.680
So, 19 years back, how much money did
you invest to build this company?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.720
Today, with the same amount, is it
possible to build a similar company?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.320
Not possible, right?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.680
So, to build a company like Polo,
how much money would you need today?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.920
Now that's the real value
of your company.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.800
The true value.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.720
I call it my replacement cost theory.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.520
Take the example of ACC shares.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.040
It was at 300.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080
And today?

Three thousand.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.080
Look, in the share market,
some people believe in fate...

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.360
...but I only believe in value.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.360
And from what I understand...

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.520
...the value of your company
is much higher than you think.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.760
I'm not sure if your methods
are legitimate.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.320
In the share market,
everything is legitimate.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.640
My methods are new, unconventional...

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.520
...so, people find them illegitimate.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.560
What's in it for you?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.600

...some time back...

...you had acquired Mazda.

...and I still want to own it.

You are misunderstanding.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.120
Wanting a stake, doesn't mean
I want to take over your company.

I am in the business
of creating wealth.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.360
I'm not interested in selling steel.

That's your expertise.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.960
I don't even want
a position on your board.

Will you just stand there
or ask what's on your mind?

The promise you've made... to
push up Polo shares, like ACC...

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.320

Mr. Singh's son was also
in the meeting.

He is a smart boy. He said,
anything you need, let me know.

It's his father's company.

How can he promise anything
under his father's rule?

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.800
Or there's something in your mind
that I don't know about, as usual.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.200
It will be done.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.280
The shares we get, we'll use
as collateral to get a bank loan.

I've also spoken to mutual fund companies.

that you are speculating?

And you can't write anything,

Yes. But speculation will lead me
to the specifics, won't it?

this information?

He is no saint either.

Why is he after Harshad then?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.880
Because Harshad portrays himself
as the king of the market.

no one stands a chance.

...I need to make entries
in the books.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.880
[Sitaraman] 'Then after a few days...'

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.160
...I need to tally
the books in PDO.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.640
All this takes a few days. So...

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.400
Darling, you worry too much.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.440
Is this my first deal with SBI?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.400
Sir, this time, it's a big amount.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.040
And the RBI guidelines, sir...

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.640
You have turned this tiny amount
to Mount Everest in your mind.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.640
[Harshad] 'For me, every amount
is small.'

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.920
You'll get the money in a few days.
You can do the entry then.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.360
Look, if the amount is big...

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.960
...the profit should be
big too, right?

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.200
I'll buy a few shares
in your wife's name.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.560
I hope that's okay.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.040
Sir, after the audit...

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.320
...we gave strict instructions
to these banks...

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.440
...to strictly follow
the RBI guidelines.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.880
But some of these banks
have been flouting rules.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.040
They are not taking us seriously.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.360
A few rotten apples, sir.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.160
Sir, please take a look
at SBI's report.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.720
Anything specific?

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.760
Sir, I'm not sure how they are doing
their securities transactions these days?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.160
[Mukherjee] 'I mean, it seems
they do maintain records but...'

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.800
'...only to confuse everybody.'

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.640
Of course, excepting those
who are creating it.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.240
Sir, to monitor these transactions
we should create...

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.920
- ...a special department in SBI...
- No... No, Mukherjee.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.040
We can't do that.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.400
The SBI is working hard to channelize funds
from abroad for our foreign exchange reserves.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.520
We can't do
any open investigation now.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.080
You should know this.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.360
[Venkitarajan sighs]

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.200
Anyway, I get your point.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.800
I'll study your report
thoroughly and...

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.520
...I'll talk to the SBI chairman
directly. Okay?

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.000
I went with all my homework.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240
I showed him all the numbers.
Graphs, charts, everything.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.640
But he's just not ready to believe it.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.480
All he wanted was proof.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.680
'If we don't get proof,
we won't do anything.'

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.200
And that's not wrong, you know.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.840
Everyone has gotten used to
working within boundaries.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.200
I predicted this whole pattern
six months back.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.280
And if you remember...

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.920
...I predicted that without solid evidence,
we will not have a story.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.400
Without proof or a witness,
we can't do anything.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.320
You will get someone. Just be patient.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.400
I am patient but I'm frustrated.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.600
I know.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.760
If this continues,
BSE will have to change to HSE.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.520
Harshad Stock Exchange.

-[honks]
- Watch out!

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.720
Thank God, I just replaced
the tyres.

Harshad.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.080
Bhushan says we are buying
Polo shares from everywhere?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.840
Let's talk calmly
in the office.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.200
Are you using banking funds?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.640
Sit.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.960
From where?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.800
- Sit down.
- How much?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.680
Is this the first time
we are doing it? Huh?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.560
It's from SBI.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.160
A little less than 500 crores,
and another 100 is expected.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.680
And which bank has given you BRs
for such a huge amount?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.280
I've told them securities
will come from PNB.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.280
You've told them?

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.600
Harshad.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.040
Are you out of your mind, Harshad?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.400
Without BRs or securities...

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.520
- ...you took 500 Crores from SBI?!
- It's only for a few days.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.720
I'll repay them
before they close their books.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.520
You could've asked.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.400
Whom would I ask?
Huh?

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.920
We will get trapped.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.480
In trying to hustle in one place,
you'll break at a hundred more, Harshad.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.800
- Stop being so negative.
- Negative?

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.280
I can't do business
playing a saint. Got it?

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.440
Had I listened to you, we would've already
shut down our business, just like <i>Pappa</i>.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.680
Is it necessary to talk
about this at home?

[Harshad] 'Get me some tea.'

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.280
Well done, Harshad.

Why did you come?

I have to. I'm his partner.

- Partner?
- Yes, why?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960
What partner?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.360
Have you signed the papers?

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.200
...or partner just in name?

that it's a wide? Such a wide wide

both, batting and umpiring?

Well done, Harshad.

You played so well.
You played some great strokes.

Are you crazy? What if I get hurt?

Not everyone has b***s like you.

Coward.

Hiding your courage between your
legs won't get you anywhere.

You have to pin it on your chest

idioms and proverbs?

to it.

that you are rigging the price.

I won't understand it.

For me, the message
is more important.

on Polo in the market.

I have earned a lot of money
for my investors.

A lot more than what I promised.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.800
I want the people to know this.

And Growmore is playing the market
with business acumen and honesty.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.120
So, honesty is the key word.

That's true. Nobody cares.

...I will put banners all over Bombay...

The first line is only
to grab attention.

Look, it says below,
that Harshad Mehta is a liar...

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.760

profits for his investors than he promised.

this courage from?

Instead of addressing the market
and clearing his position...

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.640
...he has stuck himself on posters
and cut-outs all over Bombay.

I know Ashwin <i>Bhai</i>
won't understand this.

But why can't your
brain process this?

Can't a person from the market
do marketing?

Hmm?

- Cement, steel.

- Yes, Harshad bought it last year.
- Right.

It was a loss-making
leasing company...

seem like it was a complete turnaround.

And Mazda will now enter

...and they will deal with
innovative financial instruments.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.240
So, according to your study,
am I important or not?

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.160
That depends on your approach.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.000
Whether your approach
is constructive or destructive!

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.120
Whatever it is...

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.800
...I'd like to think that I matter.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.400
That I'm important.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.120
In the market, only they are important,
who are of use to me.

You make fools of them.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.560
Mr. Mehta, I'm gonna speak
very freely.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.920
Let alone the country, you don't
even have the vision to run a corner store.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.880
[Sucheta] 'You can dominate
the market...'

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.640
'...only till such time that
the sources of yours funds are hidden.'

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.080
The day those sources become public...

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.160
...your personal funds won't last
for even twenty days.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.560
Mr. Mehta, you are not building
the nation.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.480
You are building your fortune
and your image.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.280
So, stop fooling people.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.400
Have you always been like this,
or is it the wine?

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.360
[Harshad] 'Whatever it is...'

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.400
...it was great meeting you. Really.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.560
I wish I get a chance
to give you an interview.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.440
Of course. Absolutely.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.960
But before taking my interview,
do get to know me.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.960
Because, once you know me,
you will agree with me.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.680
Thank you for the wine, Mr. Mehta.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.880
But next time, don't just order
by price.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.960
Expensive doesn't always mean good.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.920
You have yourself a good night.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.240
One moment, sir. Yeah.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.600
-[Harshad] <i>'Hello.'</i>
- Sir, Jignesh is on the line.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.080
He says it's urgent.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.560
-[Harshad] <i>'Connect him.'</i>
- Okay, sir. Yeah.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.960
Yes, Jignesh.
What is it?

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.480
Harshad <i>Bhai</i>, beware.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.080
Tomorrow at 8 am, the income tax will
raid your home and offices.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.200
It is confirmed.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.200
Then I'll welcome them in style.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.240
Find out who all are going to be there.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.080
[Jignesh] 'Okay, Harshad <i>Bhai</i>.'

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.400
Step outside, please.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.640
Hurry...

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.880
What happened?

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.360
The income tax department
will raid us tomorrow.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.040
[doorbell ringing]

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.480
Get the kids ready.
The driver is waiting downstairs.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.520
Two minutes.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.960
Harshad Mehta.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.360
Mr. Ramaswami, welcome.
Please come in...

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.440
What happened?
You are 15 minutes late.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.560
You must've hit some
traffic near the temple.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.880
People start bothering God
first in the morning.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.560
Good.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.440
I've asked them to prepare
breakfast for you.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.400
We are vegetarians so...

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.200
...there are no eggs or omelette.
Sorry.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.440
But I have asked for a
south Indian breakfast.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.880
I hope you are okay with
<i>upma</i>, <i>dosa</i>, <i>uttapam</i>?

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.520
And if anyone fancies Gujarati snacks then...

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.840
...<i>chevdo</i>, <i>chakri</i> and <i>ghatia</i>
are always there.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.320
Mr. Mehta, I have a search warrant
for your house.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.560
- Of course.
- We have to search your premise.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.040
Sure. Go ahead.
I've even informed my office.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.800
Come on kids, hurry up.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.760
Bye, <i>Pappa</i>.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.040
Hey, rascals. Come here.
What do you mean ‘bye'?

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.560
Who will greet the guests?

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.840
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.280
Go now.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.960
[Harshad] 'Now that's an
auspicious start.'

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.640
You can search all you want.
Everything is right here...

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.080
...and what isn't,
has been already paid in advance tax.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.040
Begin the search.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.880
It's a big house.
It will take time. Have some breakfast first.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.160
We will order it from outside.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.840
Oh, so you're allowed to order
from outside during an IT raid?

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.000
[phone ringing]

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:41.960
No.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.960
Hello.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.200
Yes.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.640
It's your brother.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.200
As per rules,
you can't make any calls after this.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.280
And we will receive all your calls.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.800
You can speak for now.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.960
Thank you. You are really kind.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.840
Hello.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.160
Yes, Ashwin.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.600
Yes. Mr. Ramaswami
is here with his team.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.960
No, they are not having breakfast.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.760
No, they aren't fasting.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.720
No. Fine. Okay.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:18.840
Here.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720
Will you have some after-mint?

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.440
- You aren't having breakfast.
- Upstairs.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.120
Okay.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.280
[Harshad] 'Here... eat peacefully.'

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.600
You people also, please wrap up
your work fast.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.840
Smoking is not allowed here.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.640
But for the government,
everything is allowed.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.720
Thank you.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.760
Sir, we have searched everything.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.320
[Man1] '<i>Physical records
and files are very few.</i>'

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.160
They say everything
is saved in the computers.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.880
We've confiscated the CPUs
and are bringing it.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.920
Seal the Accounts section.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.480
Okay, sir.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.560
- This...
- What do you mean, seal it?

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.320
What's your problem with my office?

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.080
It's an investigation,
Mr. Mehta.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.480
Unless we are done...

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.720
...you can't touch your books.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.480
It's not allowed.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.200
Do you know, how many people
work in my office?

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.000
Where will I send them?

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.160
I can't get a new office
just because of you.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.040
That's why we aren't sealing
the entire office.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.960
We are done here. Wrap up.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:58.960
Take all these.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:50:59.600
[Man2] 'Yes'

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.520
I hope you find what you are
looking for soon, Mr. Ramaswami.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.120
Because you won't be able
to keep my office shut for long.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.200
[Song playing]

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.320
Come on. I need more details.
Did they find anything else?

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.560
Keep me posted.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.080
Nothing.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.480
Someone must have tipped him.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.640
Right.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.840
- Next time.
- Next time.
