00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.080
[Song playing]

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.840
Bloody hell. Soft drink in hand...
no alcohol, no cigarettes...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.400
It feels like I'm doing
dynamic meditation in a hermitage.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.760
Baa!

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.120
Stay blessed. You're looking handsome.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
Who throws a party with just cola?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.080
Better than this, would have been
ice-pops from the street.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.800
Pranav Bhai, the
Indian consumer is very gullible.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.600
- Is it?
- Instead of ice-pops, he will choose cola.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.440
All these foreign companies are
waiting to bring colas to India.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.040
Really?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.840
You always talk business...

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.680
...and drag business into everything.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.200
Hold on. Are you planning to invest
in a Cola company?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.360
Forget business
and investment now.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.520
- Enjoy the party. Drink up.
- Okay.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.280
But can I say something?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.120
You don't know how to throw a party.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.480
[Harshad] 'Fine, I don't.'

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.280
- You're going to London with Ketan, right?
- Yes.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.640
There you can party how you want.
Right?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.200
What's that beer you like?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.760
Please don't remind me.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.480
- Budweiser.
- Yes, that one.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120
Just what I thought.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.320
I'll go to London
during the strike.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.760
I'll make a quick trip.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.760
But I just got to know...

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.480
...that SEBI and the brokers
are close to a settlement.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.920
And the market is going to
open again.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.360
Good.
Our SBI problem is solved too.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.840
Now Pranav Bhai,
there's only one target.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.360
To enter the market like a bull
and run a bulldozer over everyone.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.320
Clean up everyone.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.040
This talk
about Harshad and SBI...

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.640
-[Manu] 'Is it confirmed?'
- One hundred percent.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.960
Mehta will be finished
this time.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.800
He's in deep shit.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.720
Since the past few days,
the Lexus is always at SBI.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.720
They say that he's been
running to and fro so often...

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.120
...he might get dizzy and
collapse.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.840
He has returned a big chunk,
but there is some left.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.560
The market is closed and he
hasn't made any transactions outside.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.520
So, what do you guys want to do?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.560
Nobody knows where is he
getting the money to repay SBI.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.920
He hasn't liquidated any of his stocks.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.360
Once the SBI news officially
becomes public...

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
...we will have a chance to push
down Harshad's stocks.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.960
People will lose trust in him.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.280
I think this is the best opportunity.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.120
Opportunity, my foot.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.320
Spoken like a fool!

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.160
None of you have Harshad's brains.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.560
Before the news breaks out...

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.360
...he'll square off his position
and make profits.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.720
There is a strike.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.600
How will he square off his position
if the market doesn't open?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.000
F****rs,
at least keep yourselves updated.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.320
Don't you know...

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.760
...the brokers and SEBI
have reached a settlement.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.280
The market will open tomorrow.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.960
The settlement can
be dragged on, can't it?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.080
It's Manu Bhai's market.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.400
You just have to give a signal.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360
For how many days will it
need to remain closed?

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.040
Until the news comes out.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.760
The market should only open
once there is panic all around.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.520
He'll be finished in the market...

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.040
...and also won't be able to return
the money he has taken to repay SBI...

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.840
[AK] 'You kill him in the share market.'

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.400
We will stab him in the money market.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.880
I'll handle Bombay.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.000
But what about
the other stock exchanges?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.960
Leave Calcutta to me.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.640
And anyway, everyone
will follow BSE.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.600
But this SBI news
should come out soon.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.760
We can't hold the strike
for too long.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.800
[Title Montage]

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.560
Sir, I'm Sharad Bellary
from SBI.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.640
Sir, take me to anyone...
I don't have much time, Sir.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.560
There is
a huge problem at SBI, sir.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.560
Please take him to Sucheta ma'am.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.640
You can't even begin to imagine
how big the fraud is.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680
Fraud?

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.800
Five hundred crores are
missing from the books of SBI.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.240
Do you know who is behind
this fraud?

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.200
H-Harshad Mehta.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.360
- I'll get you a cup of tea.
- I don't want tea, ma'am.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.040
- No, please. Just a minute.
- Ma'am, I don't want tea.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.440
I'll be right back. Please!

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.760
[phone ringing]

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.400
- Hello.
- Hello. Yeah, Sucheta here.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.560
Listen, we need to catch up
very urgently.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.760
We have finally got some real evidence.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.600
The source is
right in front of me...

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.320
...and he says Harshad might be
in some serious trouble with SBI.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.200
- With SBI?
- Yes.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.120
He's right here...
I mean, he is in the cabin.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.440
[Sucheta] 'I just need you to explain
a few technicalities to me. Can we meet?'

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.680
Yeah, sure.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.040
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
I'll see you, bye.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.400
Where is the gentleman
who was sitting here?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.880
I brought tea for him.
I don't know where he's gone.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.120
Oh, no!

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.200
Taxi!

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.240
Hello. Yes. Can you connect me
to Debashis, please?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.360
Are you sure this Sharat Bellary
works at SBI head office..?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.200
...and he hasn't fed you
some fake news?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.720
Sharad... "D".
Sharad Bellary.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.120
I don't know but...
It sounds very convenient to me.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.480
Scripted, in fact. Look...

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.640
Not from Treasury or Accounts...

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.080
But a person from a PR department
lands up in TOI building...

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.520
...and gives this story to
no one but you...

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.920
...and then disappears without a word.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.560
Agantuk.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.680
It means "The Stranger".

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.160
It might be Satyajit Ray's last film.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.160
You know his condition, right?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.320
I was writing an article on it
for a change...

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.920
...and got trapped by
SBI's Agantuk! How strange!

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.560
Agreed. This isn't a coincidence.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.240
He's been sent to me.
But whoever has sent him...

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.800
...knows, that only I can
follow up on Harshad's story.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.880
And this story could be planted,
Sucheta.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.120
Because the way this 'Sharad',
disappeared...

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920
...I don't think he had any evidence.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.160
Do one thing, go to SBI
and cross-check?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.800
Cross-check? And what about you?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.880
I can't go right now.
I have to talk to my source.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.360
I need him to explain a few things
that Bellary was telling me.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.760
Okay.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.560
Let's meet Karamchand first,
and then go to SBI.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.040
Debashis, you'll have to go alone.
We are don't have time.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.600
- Please go to SBI.
- Okay, I'll go.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.680
Let me have tea first.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.080
Have tea at SBI.
Their tea is really good.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.960
And if you go now,
you might run into Harshad.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.840
Have a couple of sips
with him too. Please.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.080
Please...

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.600
- Please, Debashis, go.
- I'm going. I'm going!

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.600
- Can I have this?
- Please...

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.880
Hello.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.320
Whom would you like to meet?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.880
Sharat Bella... Sharad Bellary.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.440
- Name?
- Ma'am, I just told you. Sharad Bellary.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.400
- Your name, sir?
- Oh, sorry.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.800
Debashis.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.560
I'm his cousin... from Calcutta.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.800
I live there. I'm taking a train back
tonight so I thought Sharad Bhai...

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.600
Ma'am... It's a bit urgent, please.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.320
- Which department did you say?
- PR.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.280
[Receptionist] 'One second.'

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.840
'Hello. Sharad Bellary's cousin
is here to see him.'

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360
'Debashis.'

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.680
Okay. Sir, he's not in office.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.080
He left a while ago.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.080
- He hasn't come back yet?

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.080
No, he had told me
that he's going out but...

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.400
...he should have been back by now.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.600
No problem.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.200
I'll do one thing,
I'll wait in his cabin.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.920
[Receptionist] 'Sir,
he doesn't have a cabin.'

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.080
- Okay!
- 'So...'

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.680
So... I'll wait at his desk...

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.600
'Sir, you can't go anywhere,
You'll have to wait here.'

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720
- Okay.
- 'Yes.'

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.320
How did that money
go into his account?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.080
SBI would have issued the cheques
in PNB's name, right?

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.560
Harshad is just a broker.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.680
Because SBI must have issued the cheques
directly in Harshad's name.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.360
Isn't that illegal? Is it not wrong?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.480
Well!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.920
It's an accepted market practice.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.480
[DT] 'You see, when the system
is inefficient...'

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.840
...people from within, tweak it.
They twist and bend it a little.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.760
'So that business can
carry on smoothly.'

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.640
'Ease of doing business.'

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.960
Such transactions work on trust.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.080
And in business, trust is bigger
than all legalities.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.520
The problem arises when...

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.920
...people like Harshad Mehta misuse
this parallel system and turn it into a crime.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.680
'You know, they... They break the trust
of the system.'

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.720
'They...
They ruin the equilibrium.'

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.360
Either way,
this is wrong, right?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.640
Banks can only transact
with other banks.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.600
How can they issue cheques directly
in the name of a broker?

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.920
Because, sometimes, to save time, banks
transfer money into the broker's account...

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.320
...and then it's the broker's headache,
how he gets them the best deals.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.000
So...

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.560
So, as long as the money is in
the broker's account...

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.840
...he can invest it
wherever he wants?

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.120
Correct, everyone does this.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:02.920
Everyone?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.960
Don't look at me like that.
Even I do it.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.320
But I make sure I don't break
the trust of the system.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.160
[DT] 'I don't disturb its balance.'

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.440
Sucheta, I think...

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.160
...you're taking the wrong direction here.
The problem here is not...

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.200
...that SBI transferred money
into Harshad's account. Okay?

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.240
In fact, there must have been many
such transactions between them in the past.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.040
At least five to ten thousand
crores.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.080
That's why, this time also, they deposited
500 crores in his account...

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.440
...assuming he has the securities
and he will return the money.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.760
But I don't think
he has those securities.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.240
[DT] 'And I don't think PNB even knows
anything about this.'

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.560
That is crazy.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.360
Yes.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.200
I think SBI has caught wind of it.
That's why they're asking him to return the money.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.680
[DT] 'You had heard about fake BRs?'

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.280
This is the first time that,
the BRs don't exist at all.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.280
Now that is a scam!

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.440
Which department?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.200
I'm Bellary ji's cousin.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.320
Bellary? Who Bellary?

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.560
Sharad Bellary.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.760
Sharad Bellary?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.720
Which department does he work in?

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.600
- PR.
- Okay.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.160
Sir, which department are you in?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.080
I work in loans.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.360
To be honest...

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.680
...I'm here to meet Harshad Bhai.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.880
I heard that he's here too?

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.680
I'm a big fan.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.040
- Harshad Mehta?
- Yes.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.640
Has he come in his imported Lexus?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.040
I don't know.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.720
Sorry, I have to leave.
Thank you.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.840
Oh. Thank you.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.520
Which department?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.840
- HR.
- Okay.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.120
I haven't seen you before.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.120
What a coincidence.
I haven't seen you either.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.360
Oh no, no...
I just joined last month.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.240
Oh, okay. No wonder.
Thanks.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.080
I'll make a few phone calls.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.360
I'll let you know if I get
some more information.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.520
And I'll talk to my contacts
in the market.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.080
Plus, I need to talk to Harshad
as well.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.240
You'll talk to him directly?

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.160
The story is on him,
I need to know his side as well.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.800
And this is an investigative piece.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.640
Without knowing his side of the story,
it'll seem like gossip.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.200
I don't want to seem like
that kind of a journalist. So...

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.200
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.600
Change the world.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.640
I will surely try.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.600
[phone ringing]

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.520
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Mehta?

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.000
- Speaking.
- This is Sucheta Dalal.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.400
Is this a good time to talk?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.000
Depends. Is this call constructive
or destructive?

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.440
Mr. Mehta, I just wanted to check...

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.440
We've just been informed
that you've failed to deliver securities...

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.440
'...worth 500 crores to
the State Bank of India.'

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.200
'And now they're demanding their money back.
Would you care to comment?'

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.920
No.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.960
Why not?

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.080
Because it's baseless, it's nonsense.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.680
And it doesn't suit a journalist
like you to fan such rumours.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.800
Are you sure, Mr. Mehta?
Because I have sources...

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.640
...who might be able to confirm this.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.600
[Harshad] 'Look, you wanted
my reaction and you got it.'

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.560
Now, you want me to say
something that you can print.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.400
SBI knows the truth, and so do I.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.680
So you're denying it?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.120
Sucheta ji, there's no room for
such filmy gossip in the financial world.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.000
- Anyway, who is your source?
- Thank you, Mr. Mehta.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.120
Harshad, if this gets published
it'll open a pandora's box.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.840
Nothing will get published.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.560
- There is no news.
- There seems to be.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.960
She sounded determined.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.320
That's why I ask you not to
eavesdrop on my calls.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.360
If she had proof, she would have published it.
She wouldn't have called me.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.960
They know that I'm the real
deal in this business.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.440
If they publish anything without
proof, they'll be in trouble.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.120
So what are you waiting for?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.120
Show them that you're the real deal.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.480
[phone ringing]

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.160
Rajdeep.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.360
Harshad Mehta?

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.080
Put him through.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.840
500 crores. Are you joking?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.760
Listen.
It can be even more.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.200
Yes, it's possible. I've seen him
a few times myself.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.560
Three days back, there was a crowd
just to look at his car.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.160
- Which car is it...
- Lexus.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.080
Yes, Lexus.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.040
But who told you
about this 500 crore?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.560
Brother, everyone knows,
but they are keeping mum.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.160
Because if it becomes public,
even the senior officials will get f****d.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.840
-Are you serious?
-Hmmm.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.240
Sitaraman ji, please come.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.840
- Who's that?
- He will know everything.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.200
We were just talking about
your department.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.800
- Is it? What were you talking about?
- Yes.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.680
The same. Harshad Mehta case.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.920
- This gentleman here says, 500 crores have...
- Nonsense!

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320
Absolute rubbish.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.400
Don't you have anything better to do,
than gossip in the canteen?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.760
Mr. Mehta and SBI do a lot of business.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.760
So sometimes the accounting goes wrong,
but it's all settled now.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.920
All of it? All 500 crores?

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.600
No, a little is pending.
Only six or seven crores.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.760
That will be done
day after tomorrow.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.720
You guys better stop
spreading these rumours.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.240
If Mr. Khemani hears about this
he will suspend you both.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.480
Sir, he was saying. What do we care?
It's not even our department.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.600
Right.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.160
Which department are you from?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.240
PR.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.360
HR?

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.520
Yes... It's only been a few days
since I joined.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.560
PR or HR?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.000
HR.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.720
- Have some tea at least.
- No, I have something urgent to do.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.600
Okay, I should leave too.
I have a lot of work to do.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.520
- Thank you.
- Has anyone joined your department recently?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.360
No, why?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.960
That man over there.
Isn't he from your department?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.960
Who?

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.920
- Okay.
-[typewriter clicking]

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.840
Two years back. Okay, got it.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.840
Okay. No, listen.
I'll have to call you back.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.920
So? Actually, you know what,
let's talk in the conference room.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.840
- But why?
- Come... Just come.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.520
- What happened?
- Just... too many people.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.760
[Debashis] 'No.'

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.560
I think he's disappeared
after meeting you.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.400
But Sucheta,
Bellary seems to be telling the truth.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.000
Harshad has been regularly
visiting SBI...

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.280
...meetings are happening.
Something seems to be brewing.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.400
- So what do we have now?
- Nothing much.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.960
Harshad is giving the last cheque
day after tomorrow. It's a small amount.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.760
And his dues will be cleared up.
There's no news.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.240
If a criminal cleans up
the crime scene...

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.920
...does that mean the crime
never happened?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.080
He has messed with the system
and misused it.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.840
That's why he is repaying the money.
Tell me one thing, Debashis.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.560
Where are the funds coming from?

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.200
Every single penny belongs
to the people of India.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.200
How can he use it like
his father's money?

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.120
Used it whenever he wanted,
earned profit on it and returned it!

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.960
What if he had made a loss?
What if he couldn't have returned it?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.280
Sucheta, once the rest of the money
is returned, we don't have a story.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.760
As simple as that.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.120
Do you think the people at SBI
will speak about this?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.120
This is why I'm going to make sure
the story comes out tonight...

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.600
...before he returns
the rest of the money.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.320
Hello!

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.840
Sucheta, are we doing a story
on Harshad Mehta?

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.760
[Sucheta] 'How did you know?'

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.920
He called, he denied everything.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.600
Do you have his statement,
what has he denied exactly?

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.200
Do you have anything
to support your story?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.800
I have my sources.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.680
Will they speak on record?

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.080
No. But I've cross-checked all the facts
through multiple channels.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.200
Sucheta, you need to understand
this is the Times of India.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.760
Without actual paper evidence,
you can't print anything.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.760
I can't give you the go-ahead.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.560
I have faith in my sources
and in the past, people have published...

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.440
...many articles without
any paper evidence.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.680
I hope you understand
that he can even sue us...

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.800
...if the news is not true.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.560
Rajdeep,
if you won't let me publish this...

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.680
...then I'm going to have to
go to Dileep.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.200
Sure, go for it. I'm sure he'll say
the same thing.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.880
We don't claim publicly that
'we are the most courageous'.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.400
But if there is a news publication
in this country that takes a tough stance...

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.080
...then we are the one.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.080
We don't differentiate between
the powerful and the weak.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.080
Hasn't your newspaper been
too pro-government lately?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.800
In fact,
they were always pro-government.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.360
Dileep, tell me something.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.000
Are the British still paying
your salary?

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.480
The difference between others
and us is...

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.120
...that we don't keep on criticising
the government pointlessly.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.000
We are not here to just point out
the faults in the system.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.000
Oh. Come on... Mr. Dileep.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.360
Leave these politically correct answers
to us politicians.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.720
Am I right?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.200
Sorry, Mr. Padgaonkar.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.120
But you must have heard the saying...

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.920
..."The Times" flows the way
the wind blows. Huh?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.800
Actually, "The Time" flows the way
"The Times" goes.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.360
Mr. Padgaonkar, you have an
important call from Bombay.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.120
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I have a call to take.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.680
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.000
Sir, Sucheta here.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.440
Sir, sorry to bother you
but this is very urgent.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.240
Sucheta Dalal?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.920
[Sucheta] 'Yes, sir, from Bombay.'

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.600
How did you know I'm here?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.160
Sir, it's a long story. Right now,
I want to discuss something important.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.400
[Dileep] 'Go ahead, I'm listening.'

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.600
Sir, I have a scoop.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.800
Harshad Mehta has defrauded SBI
of 500 crores...

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.760
[Sucheta] '...and no one has
the slightest hint about it.'

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.880
I have a primary source
from the SBI, PR department.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.120
He came into office this morning
and gave me all the details.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.960
Sir, I really want to go ahead
with this story.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.240
[Dileep] 'So? What's the problem?'

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.120
Sir, Rajdeep is not agreeing.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.200
He says that because I don't have
any paper evidence...

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.920
...he cannot allow me
to go forward with the story.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.120
You have no evidence?

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.560
[Dileep] 'Your source...'

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.080
No, sir. But I've done a complete
background check. I'm sure of this.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.600
[Dileep] 'I understand, Sucheta.'

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.840
But try and find some evidence
of any kind.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.280
Without any evidence,
we can't publish a story this big.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.840
[Dileep] 'You should understand that.'

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.360
Sir, but this story will be dead
by tomorrow.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.920
Harshad is retuning the funds...

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.720
...and by the day after, he'll have
deposited the last cheque as well.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.800
So, there's no story then.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.840
He took the money,
and has returned it back.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.640
This isn't a loan that he
can return whenever he wants.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.360
He's misusing money from the government
to rig shares in the stock exchange.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.120
And do you think this is
his first time he's done it?

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.440
Or that he has only done it with SBI
and won't repeat it ever!?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.600
Sir, Harshad Mehta is
very well connected.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.320
SBI won't do anything
but we can.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.440
I mean, when did we journalists
stop going after criminals...

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.560
...just because nobody has reported them
to the authorities.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.200
I'll give you a solution.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.720
Call up SBI and ask them directly
if such a transaction took place...

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.080
...between them and Mr. Mehta.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.360
[Dileep] 'Confirmation should be
from some high official.'

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.760
'If they confirm it, we go ahead.'

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.240
Otherwise, we cannot do it.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.480
Okay, sir. Got it.
Thank you...

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.680
He didn't agree, right?

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.520
He wants confirmation from
SBI's senior management.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.080
Why don't you talk to the
SBI chairman directly?

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.120
Sucheta, you only have one hour before
today's edition goes into printing...

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.000
...otherwise, your story will be dead.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.520
Alright? Take a chance.
Best of luck.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.280
[Music playing]

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.680
Sir, there's a call for you.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.800
Hello.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.000
Hello. Good evening, sir.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.680
This is Sucheta Dalal from
Times of India.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.840
Yes, Ms. Dalal,
what can I do for you?

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.760
Sir, let me be direct. Is it true
that Harshad Mehta defrauded SBI...

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.360
- ...of 500 crores?
- What?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.840
No, I do not think this is true at all.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.800
Where do you get your
information from?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.040
Sir, I have a source.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.200
Your source must be misinformed,
Ms. Dalal.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.600
You see,
we have very heavy transactions...

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.000
...and sometimes reconciliation
is difficult. Sometimes delayed.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.560
I do not think you should blow this
out of proportion at all.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.600
I wish you a very good evening.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.080
Yeah, so we have the story
but they won't print it.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.520
Who is they?

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.160
Rajdeep, our Bombay editor
won't publish it.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.920
And Dileep, our head editor
wants a confirmation from SBI.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.720
I mean, he's not insisting
on paper evidence but...

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840
So did you speak to anybody?

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.400
Yes. I spoke to Goiporia directly.
But he denied it.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.040
I mean, he's not going to
admit anything, right?

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.640
If Harshad has committed a fraud,
SBI is no saint either.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.880
[Sucheta] 'They are also vulnerable.'

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.120
Yeah. And possibly guilty also.
But what now?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.040
I don't know. Why are you asking me?
Do something.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080
I really don't have time.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.840

- Yes.

- Hello...
-[Sucheta] 'I thought you also... Anyway...'

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.520
I might know someone from SBI's
senior management.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.960
[DT] 'Let me see if he can help us.'

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.600
Please, talk to him right away.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.920
Okay. If he agrees
then I'll ask him to call you.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.040
That's great... Thanks.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.960
Mayank, wait.
Where are you going?

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.440
I'm going to have dinner.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.600
Give me your pack.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.240
-I have this. Will it do?
-Hmm.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.080
- You're coming for dinner?
- No.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.440
- Okay, fine.
- You go...

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.400
...and you'll buy your own pack?

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.720
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.880
- Oh! Sorry, sir.
- No, please go on.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.600
I know, behind this cloud of smoke,
there must be a smoking hot story.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.880
Don't stop. I don't want to disturb
your chain of thought.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.360
I was just going to stretch my legs.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.160
No, sir. I'm fine, thank you.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.720
It's quite common these days,
Everyone's smoking.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.760
By the way,
why doesn't your Common Man smoke?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.680
- Oh! He has asthma.
- Oh, yes.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.360
I've always wanted to
ask you a question, sir.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.000
Why is your "Common Man"
always a man?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.400
Why not a "Common Woman"?

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.840
You see, a woman cannot be common.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.040
Women are always special.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.600
- Sure.
- Right?

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.960

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.840
You've used this word "scam"
so many times.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.160
I mean, we use words like
financial frauds or scandal, etcetera...

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.160
...for the same thing.
You know it, right?

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.400
It's time to introduce this strong word
in the Indian financial world.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.400
To let the readers know about it. I mean,
the western media has already adopted it.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.880
There are so many scams
happening left, right and center.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.080
Mark my words, in the next
three to four years...

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.640
...this word will be
common parlance.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.240
Did you speak to Dileep?

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.640
Well, I've asked Mayank to try.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.360
I'll talk to him as soon as we
get through.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.600
- Sucheta...
- I know...

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.680
Are you fine?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.520
- Yes.
- Alright. See if you can work it out.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.720
Mayank.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.400
Sir, call for you again.
Sir, it's urgent.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.840
I've got the cordless for you.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.840
- Hello.
- Sir, I've got a confirmation.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.440
-[Dileep] 'Officially?'
- Not officially...

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.320
...but it is from the senior management,
just as you asked.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.200
[Dileep] 'That's not enough,
Sucheta.'

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.200
Sir, do you remember,
three months ago...

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.920
...we had a similar discussion
when I broke the Rajan Pillai story?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.680
You believed in me then,
and it turned out to be true.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.360
And you even published the story
on the seventh page.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.520
-[Dileep] 'Okay, so?'
- So, sir, trust my gut on this.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.760
This needs to come out.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.600
[Dileep] 'Okay, I'll talk to Rajdeep.
But remember...'

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.360
'...if we get into trouble because of this,
your time at TOI is over.'

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.240
'Still want to go ahead with this?'

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.200
Yes!

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.600
- 'Sure?'
- Five hundred percent.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320
[Dileep] 'Okay.'

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.040
Sucheta is just being stubborn.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.760
How can you publish something
against a celebrity...

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.600
...without enough corroboration?

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.480
She thinks it's a scoop.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.840
Scoop?

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.960
Tell her, if she needs a scoop,
go buy ice-cream.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.760
Why don't you tell her that? Huh?

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.480
[phone ringing]

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.960
Hello? Yeah?

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.880
Dileep's on the line.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.520
Sucheta.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.120
Front page.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.760
Congratulations.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.320
Who changed the headline?

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.600
Harshad Mehta is not even mentioned
in this article.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.640
He has been referred to as "Big Bull"
everywhere.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.040
I changed it, Sucheta.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.640
Why?

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.800
This was the safest option.
This way, we all are safe.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.440
But you could have taken me into confidence,
you could have asked me once.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.760
I discussed it with Rajdeep
and Dileep.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.320
And that was the best option.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.600
Sucheta! Sucheta...

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.760
What happened?

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.640
[phone ringing]

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.760
[phone ringing continues]

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.880
[phone ringing continues]

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.320
