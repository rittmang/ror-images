00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.520
Only the rich can do business
in this country.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.480
Because there are huge pitfalls
along this road.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520
A trader or a businessman
can easily fall into them.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920
It's impossible to run a business
on this road with honesty and hard work.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.520
But there is a way...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
...a shortcut.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.680
Which goes via
Delhi's parliament house.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.960
With connections, you
can get anything done.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.640
What's important is,
who are your connections...

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.720
...and how high up they are.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.040
The more influential they are...

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.440
...the higher your business will soar.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.000
I have also paid my respects
in the power portals of Delhi.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.040
My relationship with Delhi
is old and very deep.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.480
During the 91 elections...

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.800
...we gave a lot of donation
to the party.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.160
Large sums.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.280
And everyone is aware of this, from the
party's advisor to the Prime Minister.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.800
And so when the by-election dates
were declared...

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.400
...I spoke to Sahab.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.360
And I went to pay my respects to him.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600
Indrajit Sharma.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.120
Joint secretary to PM.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.120
He was the one who
fixed the meeting.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.600
The date was 4th November, 1991.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.840
[Harshad]'I was wondering
why would the Prime Minister meet me?'

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.920
'What will he talk to me about?'

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.960
But he knew everything about me.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.120
As soon as he met me, he said...

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.000
..."Harshad, our party has seen
you people like our friends."

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.520
"And together we can do bigger things."

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.320
But today, the police, CBI...

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.840
...and every other agency of the
government is only after one man.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.880
Harshad Mehta.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.640
Why? Because I've done a scam?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.960
No. The reason is that...

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.880
...I know a lot about
the country's Prime Minister...

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.600
...and about many
others in this party.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.800
And I know the truth.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.680
Riots are going on because of
the Babri Masjid demolition...

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.800
...but my family is more
scared of the CBI than the riots.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.440
CBI can do anything to me
and my family.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.120
I am shooting this video so that,
if something happens to me...

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.840
...people should know
who is behind it.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.520
[Title Montage]

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.680
[Bhushan coughing]

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.680
What are you doing, Mishra?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.720
How much did you hit him?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.640
Is your brain between your legs?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.080
[Madhavan] 'Look at his face.
It's tilted like 6:05 on a clock.'

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.640
Bhushan ji is not a goon.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.680
If he spoke clearly, I'd let him go.
But he's not willing to talk.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.560
What do I say?
In what language should I speak?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.320
Do you people even
understand anything?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.640
Bhushan ji, you're not a goon.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.280
You're a p**p.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.240
You and your boss
have turned the market into a br***el.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.440
[Madhavan] 'Right?'

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.920
And who understands
what a p**p says?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.040
Only the prostitutes.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.920
Look at them.
Do they look like prostitutes?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.440
Talk in a language that
they'll understand.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.760
- This is the language of the business...
- Shut up!

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.720
Business... business... business!

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.560
Do you think we are a******s!

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.480
We know what business you do.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.400
Look at them.
Look at their faces.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.840
They have just one goal
and that is to sc**w Harshad Mehta.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.480
But that is not happening,
so till then...

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.800
...we'll sc**w you. Got it?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.760
If you've understood...
Start talking.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.680
'Talk', 'Talk'..?
What should I say?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.840
[CBI Officer] 'Lower your voice!'

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.040
You seem angry.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.720
Don't get mad, Bhushan ji.
That's our job.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.320
Go and get a towel. Get a towel.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.840
Look how much he's sweating.
You have beaten him to a pulp!

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.040
[Madhavan] 'Don't get angry.'

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.960
Get the towel.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.840
Wipe your face.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.280
[Madhavan] 'Go on, wipe your face.'

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.360
What is this?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.680
[Madhavan laughs]
What happened? Did you piss on it?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.200
Are you the CBI, or a pack of dogs?

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.240
You piss wherever you like.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.560
I asked you to wet the towel
with water, not with piss.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.320
You don't even know how to interrogate.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.000
At least, ask the right questions.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.480
We are asking the wrong questions,
is it? Okay.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.400
We'll ask the right question.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.680
Mishra ji, what's the right
question these days?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.520
[Mishra] 'Ilu, Ilu...'

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.760
Ilu, Ilu.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.880
What is Ilu, Ilu?
Right. Should I ask you that?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.040
What the f**k is Ilu Ilu?
Should I ask you that question?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.400
Will you answer that?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.760
F*****g p**p.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.960
For now I've only wiped your
face with piss.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.160
If you act smart,
I'll piss on your face.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.920
When Harshad finds out,
he'll make everyone pay for it.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.800
Let me get out of here.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.200
Delhi is in his pocket.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.800
Yes, Harshad is the boss, right?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.640
He has Delhi in his pocket.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.640
I'll put all his p***ps from Delhi
behind bars too, got it?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.120
Would you put the Prime Minister...

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.400
...behind bars too?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.520
Step outside.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800
What did you say?
What about the Prime Minister?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.160
Are you out of your mind, Madhavan?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.080
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.600
Sir, why do you look surprised?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.040
It's not like we've found
water on the moon, sir.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.840
This, we have known all along...

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.840
...that Harshad might have
big political connections. That's it.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.280
One of Harshad's men tells you
that the PM backs him.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.520
So, you're going to raid 7 RCR now?
Huh?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.960
What's this obsession that you have
with Prime Ministers?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.160
Sir, from my previous experiences,
I know...

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.080
...that it's not possible to raid
7, Race Course Road.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.440
But sir, we can start a primary enquiry.
At least that.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.400
- Madhavan, y-you're not serious.
- I'm serious, sir.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.200
And my sense of humour is completely apolitical
and this case is turning political.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.760
[Madhavan] 'Just hear me out, sir.'

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.160
I'm 100 percent sure, Bhushan Bhatt
can be our approver.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.680
If we host him a bit more,
he'll start singing all the details.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.320
[Madhavan] 'It's done.'

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.400
You need to slow down, Madhavan.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.440
[Das] 'Let me think it through.'

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.000
Slow down, sir?
We are almost there.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.080
This is the list of assets
that the custodian has asked for.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.680
I'll give it to the jailer. Sign them.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.760
Properties, cars, shares...

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.480
Bhai, they've have attached
everything.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.840
Have they attached the Lexus too?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.480
Don't think about it.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.440
Once you are out,
we'll deal with everyone.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.080
Don't worry.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.400
Any news from Swami ji?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.800
We have given him a lot of money.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.280
He who eats, gets the crop.
He who reaps, gets God.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.400
Whenever I call Swami ji,
his disciples say he is meditating.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.840
That he will call back.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.480
I don't know how long
he is going to meditate.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.320
Now, not another penny to anyone.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.560
Enough is enough.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.360
Tell those p**ps from Delhi...

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.080
- ...that I won't remain mum for long.
- It'll be fine. It will all be fine.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.120
Don't worry.
Take care of yourse...

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.360
Based on a statement
made by a criminal or an accused...

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.440
...CBI will question
the Prime Minister of this country...

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.280
...would that be appropriate?

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.520
Swami ji, even if we explain
this to Madhavan and stop him...

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.280
...this won't end here.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.960
Das, when a question has
many answers...

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.840
...suspicion is always
on the one giving the answers.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.880
[swami] 'And in this entire fraud,
In this scam...'

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800
'...every question should lead
to only one answer.'

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.400
Harshad Mehta.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480
This is the one answer...

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.440
...that will be appreciated by both,
the public and the parliament.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.480
But I don't know if Madhavan
will agree to this.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.160
Are you the chief of CBI,
or Madhavan?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.120
[Swami] 'And one more
important thing.'

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.720
That journalist...
Sucheta... Sucheta Dalal.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.680
Please keep an eye on her too.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.160
There is someone
who is telling her things...

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.880
...she shouldn't know.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.880
I think someone is following us.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.160
Sir, I need to talk to you.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.120
Yes.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.840
A few of my men have been asked
to keep an eye on some journalist, sir.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.520
-[Das] 'Journalist?'
- Sucheta Dalal.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.960
But that's not the point, sir.
The point is...

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.800
...that my manpower is being used
for something absolutely unnecessary and trivial.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.680
Your manpower?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.320
Madhavan, let's get this thing
very clear first.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.320
They are not your men.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.440
They are CBI officers.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.400
I'm aware of that, sir.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.600
After so many years in service,
I'm well aware of that.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.640
But the point is, the case that
these officers are working on...

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.920
- I'm the investigating officer of that case...
- They're simply following my orders.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.520
Okay?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.960
Okay.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.120
Okay.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.640
In that case, sir,
I want to repeat that...

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.600
...it's a complete waste of time
and resources.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.160
Madhavan...

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.600
- Sir.
- You know...

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.360
I really like you.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.480
I really like the way you're dedicated
towards this case.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.680
And I also know that you're the best
in our department.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.040
But please...
Please try to understand.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.320
I'm trying to get this
investigation back on the track.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.840
Sir, the investigation never went off track.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.720
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- For God's sake, Madhavan.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.720
This is a financial scam!

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.560
Because of your personal vendetta,
you're unnecessarily trying...

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.400
...to make this political.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.120
Personal vendetta, sir?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.080
How? How is it personal?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.640
You just cannot drag an innocent
prime minister into this mess.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.760
Don't drag his name just because
he was not happy with you...

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.160
...the way you handled Bofors.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.040
Do you have any proof against the PM
in this scam?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.720
Tell me.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.720
You're just going by
what some lackey told you?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.080
He's trying to divert this case,
try to understand.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.200
You simply focus on Harshad,
that's it.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.480
Sir... such a huge scam...

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.840
...such a huge financial fraud, that
we're still only estimating the numbers...

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.760
And you're trying to tell me
that Harshad pulled it off on his own!

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.800
Without any support, sir?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.960
I think from now,
I should be taking charge of this case.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.320
- Sorry, sir?
-[Das] 'Yes.'

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.920
'I should be taking charge
of this case.'

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.400
Madhavan, I believe you have had
a wonderful career in CBI.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.320
I don't want this case to be a personal
embarrassment for you and CBI, both.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.720
I get it, sir.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.840
Sir, I am not very fond
of being embarrassed either.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.840
But I just want to tell you
one thing.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.680
Embarrassment is going to be
your lot, sir.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.160
People will call you a parrot.
A parrot.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.120
What do you mean by that?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.960
What do I mean? Parrot?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.120
Sir, the order has come
from someplace else.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.080
You're just repeating them.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.960
And a parrot often repeats
whatever its master speaks.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.360
You're a caged parrot, sir.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.440
I'll make it easier for you, sir.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.880
I will leave.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.200
I'm not the ass who will listen
to a parrot.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.000
I'll send you my resignation.
Have a good day, sir.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.640
Listen, Madhavan...

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.560
Think about what you will tell the press,
because that is going to be difficult.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.400
How are you going to explain
to them...

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.600
...why the investigating officer
of this case was compelled to leave...

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.240
...right in the middle
of the investigation?

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.240
[Madhavan] 'What will you say?'

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.160
Or learn the master's answer by rote
and repeat it like a parrot.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.280
And sir, one more thing.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.480
A parrot is also referred to, as
his masters voice.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.840
So if the press refers to you as
his masters voice, don't get confused.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.320
They still mean you.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.960
[swami] 'His sudden resignation
can raise some difficult questions.'

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.840
No. That's not a problem.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.480
I'll tell the press...

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.760
...that he was disappointed
because his promotion didn't go through.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.400
That's why he resigned.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.640
[swami] 'That makes sense. Hari om.'

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.480
I'll prescribe you some medicines,
take them regularly.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.720
How will medicines help, Doctor?

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.240
Look at the state of this place.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.400
[Harshad] 'So many days in here
have totally f****d me.'

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.520
You had said it's easy to get bail
in such cases.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.360
Mr. Mehta, don't worry.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.440
CBI has given an undertaking
to the special court judge...

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.480
...that their investigation
can only go on till 30th July.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.160
- You're free to go after that.
- You're sure, right?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.600
Yes. I've seen the undertaking.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.160
That's good.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.720
I'll celebrate my birthday at home.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.960
I have never stayed...

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.440
...away from home for so long.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.520
Look...

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.200
We have Harshad's custody
till the 30th of July.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.240
But we have to make sure
that we have him for...

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.120
...another fortnight at least.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.960
Do one thing, file as many
FIRs as possible, against him.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.240
[CBI officer] 'Okay, sir.'

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.960
The UCO bill discounting case,
the PFC deal...

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.600
File FIRs in all cases.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.160
Then go to the courts and tell them
we are investigating 15 to 16 banks...

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.040
...and we need Harshad
in that connection.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.480
I hope Justice Variava will agree.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.400
[CBI officer] 'Okay, sir. What do we do with
Bhushan Bhatt?'

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.240
Bhushan Bhatt... will not go
against Harshad.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.960
He's very loyal. And we don't have
much against him.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.880
So, let's not waste time on him.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.240
[CBI Officer] 'Okay, sir.'

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.360
[door bell ringing]

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.880
No...
Wait, have some patience.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.080
Harshad?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.720
CBI has asked for custody.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120
[Ashwin] 'Another 15 days.'

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.360
What happens next,
we'll only know on the 13th.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.240
It's been two months, and they are
still not done with their interrogation?

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.080
They are not holding him
for interrogation anymore.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920
They're troubling him.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.560
They are pressurising him
to confess.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.320
They want him to admit
that it's his mistake.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.360
Bhabhi, there's a notice
in your name too.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.920
In my name?

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.320
Yes, it's a tax order
in your and Harshad's names.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280
How much is the order for?

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.360
[Ashwin] 'Ten thousand... crores.'

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720
All the banks we investigated...

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.840
...their books have
one name in common.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.800
Harshad Mehta.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.480
Sooner or later we are going to
find out...

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.320
...how did you manage all of it
on your own.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.600
But it'll be better if you tell us.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.080
Whom did you bribe in these banks?

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.680
I haven't bribed anyone
in any of these banks.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.920
Oh, yes! You don't bribe.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.640
You have coined a new term for it,
what was it...

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.920
Bankerage, right?

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.800
Did you think...

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.000
...that because the CBI doesn't
speak your financial language...

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.960
...you can take us for a ride
to the moon and back!?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.160
[Das] 'Huh?'

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.600
You've conducted such a big fraud...

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.560
...that we need an army of accountants
just to get the estimates.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.200
[Das] 'And you're pretending
that you pulled it off...'

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.320
'...without any internal support
from these banks.'

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.240
I know very well...

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.440
...that you had a setting
in every bank.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.800
I didn't have any setting
anywhere.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.640
All your numbers are wrong.
It's all disproportionate.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.680
I don't owe anyone a single penny
and that's the only truth.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.400
Harshad, you're making your life
more and more difficult.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.760
[Das] 'Jail will become
your permanent address.'

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.560
[glass shatters]

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.000
Is this a way to communicate?
You could have phoned me...

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.160
I admit it's the wrong way, Suchetaji.
That's why I apologised on the note.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.880
But I didn't have a choice.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.720
The CBI has eyes on us 24/7.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.160
They might be tapping our phones...

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.320
...maybe your phone is also being tapped.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.360
After all, you are connected
with this case too...

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.680
...and the government? They are
treating us like terrorists.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.200
I'm scared that CBI might kill
my brother Harshad.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.000
He's in a bad state.
I had to tell someone...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.160
Why me? You could have gone
to any other journalist?

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.080
- I'm scared I might lose my brother...
- Why are you telling me this?

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.560
You're worried about your brother?
What about those people...

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.120
...whose life's savings and families
have been ruined by your brother?

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.760
Won't it be better
to write about them?

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.160
Please, Suchetaji...

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.320
[knock on the door]

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.840
[Rahil's wife] 'Open the door, it's me.'

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.840
'I'm alone out here.'

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440
Come in quickly.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.600
What are you doing?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.960
Didn't I ask you to
lock the door from outside?

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.800
How much longer
will we stay locked in?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.120
What should I do?
Tell me.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.040
Every time I step out,
they harass me for money.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.120
Last time, they threatened to kill me.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.120
No, I know, that they won't kill me.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.000
They'll hand me over to the police.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.240
The police didn't let Harshad go,
what will they do to me?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.280
No, nothing will happen.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.720
- Everything is over.
- No.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.800
- No, really, everything is over.
- No.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.360
You're right.
I won't be able to live like this.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.480
- I can't live like this, hiding in fear.
- Rahil...

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.680
[Judge] 'Are you sure you have completed
all your investigations?'

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.000
[CBI Attorney] 'Yes, sir.'

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.520
[Judge] 'Okay, Mr. Mehta,
your bail is sanctioned now.'

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.840
[Ashwin] 'Don't worry, okay?
Go out for a few days with Jyoti.'

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.760
Mr. Mehta, we are from the
Enforcement Directorate.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.360
We are arresting you for breaking
the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act...

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.480
...under section 35 and 62.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.680
- So please...
- Do you have a warrant?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.880
- Arrest him.
- Warrant?

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.200
Show us the papers.
Lawyer saheb, talk to them.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.960
So you're saying you don't have
any account in any swiss bank?

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.840
No, I don't.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.280
So then, how do you transfer
your money abroad?

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.680
- By laundering money?
- What?

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.320
We can get the details of your
operator in minutes.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.480
I don't have anybody
who launders money for me.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.000
- So you don't have an operator?
- No, I don't.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.800
Who is this Mohan Lal, then?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.760
One of your ex-employees
took his name...

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.160
...didn't you send him there
on the day of the market opening?

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.680
Mohanlal S. Mithaiwala.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.560
He is a confectioner.
Not a money launderer.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.760
It's so clear that your source is deaf.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.000
[Das] 'We can't keep Harshad
locked up anymore.'

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.400
'He's been in ED's custody
for five weeks.'

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.200
It can get tough to answer
the court and the media.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.560
Everyone has been released on bail.
Even the SBI people.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.960
...How much longer can we
keep Harshad locked up?

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.920
[Swami] 'Let him go then.'

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.280
'If you can't lock him up
physically, so be it...'

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.080
'...at least, you can
tie him down mentally.'

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.800
'Remind him not to spread
rumours about the Prime Minister.'

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.560
'And if he makes
such a mistake again...'

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.520
'...he will be accused for so many
more crimes in so many more cases...'

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.840
'...that he'll spend 10 to 15 years
in jail.'

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.760
- Okay, Swami ji.
- Hari Om.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.760
[crowd] 'Harshad Bhai...'

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.440
'Harshad Bhai...'

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.240
'Harshad Bhai...'

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.400
'Harshad Bhai...'

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.640
Harshad Bhai...

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.640
Harshad Bhai!

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.280
Harshad Bhai!

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.320
My son!

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.360
Let me ward off the evil eye.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.760
Rascals!

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.120
How weak you've become...

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.600
You couldn't sleep there, right?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.040
I read in the news that you slept
on the floor using shoes as a pillow...

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.840
- Oh, Mummy!
- Stop it, Mummy...

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.120
- Go, eat something and go to sleep.
- Yes.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.640
I've made lapsi.
porridge

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.120
Mummy, please tell me she didn't make
an eggplant mash with lapsi. brinjal/ porridge

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.600
Because I have already been mashed.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.800
He hasn't lost his humour.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.840
Go, Jyoti.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.120
'Lots of fruits, Mr. Mehta.'

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.400
'You've become quite health conscious.'

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.920
Oranges.
These days I'm loving oranges.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.840
Have you ever had prison food?

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.240
Have you ever had water there?

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.640
Have you ever seen
the inside of a jail?

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.360
I don't wish that even for my enemy.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.480
I went in with such pride.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.760
But in four months...

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.600
I've been completely deflated.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.280
And then I've understood...

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.040
...what "Health is wealth" means.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.120
And I've also understood...

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.040
...that I will only have to
help myself.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.120
That's not true.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.880
Your friends helped you
when you needed it.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.280
Harshad, you came to Delhi
and didn't tell me?

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.360
You could've called.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.280
It's strange that I get to know
from others about your arrival.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.920
You only inform your friends
about your plans.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.360
Friends.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.360
- Please have something.
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.040
It's good for calcium,
you should have.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.120
Your friends from the JPC
have also summoned me.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.920
And what a coincidence...

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.080
You thought of me at the exact
same time.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.520
Before I appear at the parliamentary
committee, you appeared here.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.160
I realise. At the JPC...

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.160
...if any names pop up,
the PM...

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.240
...and Swami ji
will be in trouble.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.240
[Harshad] 'Tell me something.'

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.800
Are they worried for me
or themselves?

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.120
Harshad, a lot of names have
already been taken before the JPC.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.160
There shouldn't be any more names.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.600
It's in everybody's best interest.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.160
Especially yours.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:44.880
Right.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.280
I won't take any names.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.720
As long as you keep protecting me.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.320
Of course, Harshad.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.440
Okay, I'll say what you
came here to say.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.520
I won't mention the Prime Minister.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.000
You see, after these
so-called revelations...

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.600
...various people have given
various names to the scam.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.280
Initially,
it was called the stock scam.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.120
Brokers didn't like it so they called it
the bank scam.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.320
But I will tell you what it is.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.760
It is the Citi scam.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.760
Citibank is the beehive of all
the illegal activities in the system.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.440
Let's just look at
our Indian money markets.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.720
In the Indian money market, foreign banks
like Citibank rule as they wish.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.280
And they mint a ton of money.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.760
Citibank has all the money...

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.560
...to buy every new issue
of every government bonds.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.960
They have the lion's share
in the market.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.800
So once they corner all the securities,
all the small players are at their mercy.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.200
And that's not all.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.760
Citibank makes sure...

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.320
...that it maintains a dominant
position in the market.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.000
And how do they do it?

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.440
By exploiting the loopholes
in the system...

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.040
By violating RBI guidelines...

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.560
...and by influencing policy-making
in Delhi...

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.680
...through their powerful
advisory boards.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.360
More than 80 percent transactions
have sophisticated syndicates involved.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.200
They don't let outsiders enter.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.520
And they can easily exploit...

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.280
...the slow and ignorant
Indian banking system.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.680
No one even understands this.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.880
Very few journalists like
Sucheta Dalal have brought it out.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.560
I'm willing to help.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.080
The whole truth will be out.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.840
I'm ready to cooperate with
all the investigative agencies.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.520
But only if I'm exonerated
from all the charges.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.040
If I was in your shoes...

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.840
...to start with,
I'd be looking into PMS deals.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.360
PMS. Portfolio management services...

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.920
...of Citibank.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.040
Once you do that you'll realise
why Citibank is the kingpin...

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.000
...of all the dubious PMS deals in India.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.760
Mr. Tyagi,
I will not waste time.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.840
Let us get straight to the point.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.320
There are severe allegations
against your bank.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.440
What kind of allegations?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.280
Your bank is involved in irregularities
like other banks.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.280
For example?

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.320
Irregularities regarding PMS,
for example...

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.600
You can go through all our books.
I have nothing to hide.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.680
In fact, I can personally assist you
to get a better understanding of my books.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.440
All our deals, every single one of them,
are in strict accordance...

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.760
...with the guidelines set
by the Reserve bank of India.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.280
We have never flouted a single rule.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.440
You should know that
we have already seen...

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.320
...some of your books
and have several issues with it.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.040
But with due respect, sir...

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.040
...misunderstandings are natural
in financial matters.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.200
There can be misinterpretation
because of ignorance and...

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.120
Are you calling us ignorant,
Mr. Tyagi?

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.440
Not at all. I'm sure you all are
very learned men.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.360
But we are also Citibank.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.280
We have been in India since 90 years.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.640
We are very committed
to this country.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.120
We have invested large sums
of money.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.520
We haven't even taken any dividend
for the last four years.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.080
We have nurtured the NRI investment
in this country.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.320
We brought the Digital
equipment corporation to this country.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.480
I don't understand why being
successful is such a crime here.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.480
[engine starting]

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.800
[Venkitarajan] 'Are you sure the CBI
is following you?'

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.040
[Sucheta] 'Yes, I've seen them
near my house too.'

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.920
Then, we can't meet like this.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.320
But there is someone else
who is interested in meeting you.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.120
Needless to say,
this meeting will be unofficial.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.760
Can you go to Delhi today?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.280
I think you should go.
It could be an interesting meeting.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.600
CBI, government and media...

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.440
...are after one man.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.440
But I think we should shift
the focus.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.920
Banks, International banks...

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.120
...and government-owned
companies.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.080
JPC has limited powers.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.200
And we are not
an investigative body also.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.080
'We have tons of information
but we can do nothing with it.'

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.240
Technically, we can't make it public.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.400
But you can find a way
to make it reach your readers.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.960
Once it's out...

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.040
...the CBI will have to investigate.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.360
They will have no excuse.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.440
These are not just files,
but the truth of the system. Truth.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.520
But yes, you can only do it
in this room.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.520
You can't take anything
out of this room.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.840
Mr. Singh has more files.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.880
He's getting it in the afternoon.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.440
Here you are. You need anything else,
let me know, okay?

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.320
There are some foreign banks who thought
they would get away with anything.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.040
They made a mockery of bank receipts and did not
even maintain proper records for verification.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.520
Some of the documents of bulk
of their securities deals are...

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.200
...conveniently missing.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.400
You can check all the papers
and ask me anything you like.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.640
[Sucheta] 'As we dug deep into
the JPC reports and records...'

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.320
'...it became very clear that
the Harshad Mehta scam...'

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.400
'...was a part of the bigger irregularities
in the banking system.'

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.880
'Irregularities and flaws that
Harshad didn't invent...'

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.400
'...but he misused them freely.'

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.520
'Another thing was clear.'

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.480
'Along with Harshad Mehta,
it was important to investigate banks...'

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.040
'...especially Citibank and its
brokers.'

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.360
'This was the only way to clean
the system completely.'

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.440
Sir, I agree some of our dealings
may look problematic...

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.520
...and we may have suffered
some big losses.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.680
But let me assure you, sir...

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.080
...that none of our PMS clients or our
regular customers have lost any money.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.080
Mr. Rao, it's not only about
profits and losses.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.280
People have been questioning the way you
are operating in the money market.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.400
Everyone is saying,
Citibank is a bully.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.680
Sir, the people who are calling us
a bully...

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.720
...are the same people who probably
couldn't compete with us.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.280
Let me refresh your memory quickly,
sir...

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.080
...of how patriotic we are...

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.240
...and what our allegiance
to this country means, to us.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.960
1990, just two years back...

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.600
...when India was under the hammer
of US trade representative Carla Hills...

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.800
...during the balance of payments crisis.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.720
It was I who stood strongly for India...

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.880
...against the USA threat
of trade sanctions.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.640
If you remember, sir, we ran full-page
pro-India advertisements.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.840
Just to show how patriotic we are.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.040
And look, today you are
calling us foreigners.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.600
Anyway.
I'm going to do my best and...

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.720
...I'll try and satisfy you
with our actions, sir.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560
I hope so.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.440
These buffoons from the JPC must have
leaked the information to the press.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.760
These jokers are clueless
about how business is done in India.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.960
Now I may have handled
the Finance Minister for the time being.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.080
But since all our documents
are under intense scrutiny...

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.640
...a press hearing can happen anytime.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.560
But these things happen.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.040
There's no need to worry.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.440
In a few days, there will be a cricket
match between India and Pakistan...

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.880
...where India is going
to defeat Pakistan...

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.240
That's it. Everyone will be happy.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.280
They will forget everything.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.440
I don't think so.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.200
Look, it's time for you to move on.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.040
What are you trying to say?

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.880
- Are you asking me to resign?
- No.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.000
I'm not asking you to resign.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.280
You've been our star performer.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.080
You have earned us a fortune
from the treasury department.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.560
'I just want you to stay away
from this investigation.'

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.920
So congratulations.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.480
You've been promoted
and moved to New York.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.960
- You're not serious.
- I am.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.440
And now I'm going to order
the most expensive wine on the menu.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.800
And unfortunately, you're going to
be paying for it.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.640
I hope you're carrying your card.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.240
This is India.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.560
I only deal in cash.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.080
You're going to America
in the middle of all this?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.320
Not for a holiday.
The management has decided this...

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.400
...and it's the best for all of us.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.600
All of us? Ah!

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.160
Or for you and your bank?

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.680
Our offices and homes
are being raided.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.480
They are looking into our accounts.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.080
They even arrested me, goddamn it!
I was in jail.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.560
- But now you're out.
- Yeah, but on bail.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.720
Do you have any idea how many cases
they have filed against us?

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.760
I'm not sure, but not as many as
they have filed against Harshad.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.440
So now you think this is funny?

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.280
Come on, AK! Relax.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.720
The system is flawed.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.400
And you can't file a case
against a system.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.440
You can't arrest a system.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.200
All this is going to die down soon.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440
Just keep a low profile.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.080
I must go now.
Jerry is waiting for me.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.000
But you stay in touch. All the best.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.400
Before the Joint Parliamentary Committee,
he didn't even let Citibank go...

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.000
What will he do with us?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.040
Wait and watch...

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.040
...when the time is right,
he'll come forward like a film hero...

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.240
...and rat us all out.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.760
Harshad is not our enemy.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.320
But he should know he has
a lot of enemies.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.760
Though we can't send him back to jail,
he should always fear going back.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.760
He should have nightmares about jail.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.440
[doorbell ringing]

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.840
Come in. Come on.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.280
Start, start.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.640
- What is this? Ashwin!
- Search every bloody corner.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.440
What's going on, sir?

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.880
We have a search warrant.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.680
Your house is not Marine Drive,
that we have come here for a stroll.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.040
- We have some solid information.
- What information?

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.680
What happened?

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.840
Do you know Niraj Shah?

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.760
We have met a couple of times.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.200
A couple of times?

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.120
According to our information,
your families are very close.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.080
You go on holidays together.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.240
We have a common tour operator.
We met during a holiday.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.040
Growmore handles their
investments too, right?

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.480
Maybe.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.640
Do you have any idea
how many clients we have?

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.480
Do you have any idea that Niraj has a
narcotics business?

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.560
How would we know?

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.160
And what business he does,
how does it concern us?

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.800
Whether it concerns you or not,
we will decide that, Mr. Mehta.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.960
But if you know anything...

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.720
...tell us voluntarily.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.360
Or, you know
that we can make the connection.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.200
It will have to be a made-up connection,
because in reality there is none.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.680
Mr. Mehta, narcotics...

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.320
...is not like a share market scam.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.120
You must have heard about COFEPOSA.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.920
Conservation of Foreign Exchange
and Prevention of Smuggling activities Act.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.520
If you are charged with this,
you can forget about living a normal life.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.040
And I am not...
I am not f*****g around, okay?

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.680
[CBI officer] 'Sir, we didn't find anything.'

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.520
Oh!

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.240
It's cocaine... not snacks
that you'll find frying in the kitchen.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.960
No one conducts narcotics business
from home.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.200
I hope you haven't forgotten
our office.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.440
If you remember anything,
please pay us a visit.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.040
And if we find something,
we'll take you away.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.600
Okay?

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.120
- Come on, everybody. Let's move.
-[Officer] 'Yes, Sir.'

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.640
Narcotics?

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.600
What is going on?

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.840
Left to them, they'll call
us terrorists next.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.320
We should get prepared.
Now, they will regularly raid us.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.680
We had a video camera, didn't we?
Where is it?

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.200
What will you do
with a video camera?

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.480
I'll make a film.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.080
Harshad?

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.280
I'm recording this video because...

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.040
...if anything happens to me,
people should know who is responsible.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.160
Swami ji has severed all
ties with us, right?

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.760
Now it's time...

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.800
...to wake that Swami from his meditation.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.480
The government and Swami
should both know...

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.680
...that Harshad's bad luck can
also cast a shadow on them.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.160
If they try to f*** with me...

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.480
...the whole country
will f*** them over.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.400
I know how CBI works.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.200
They are on Delhi's leash,
and they bark on command.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.840
Pranav, you're a fool.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.160
You should have brought him to me
right in the beginning.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.400
Those foolish lawyers
who call themselves barristers...

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.040
...and don't even know how to
wear a coat properly...

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.960
Why did you have to go to them?

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.360
Ram uncle, you're
the god of the judiciary.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
We felt this was too small
a matter, to trouble God with.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.440
We didn't know this war
would drag on for so long...

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.760
...that the PMO would enter
the battlefield.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.480
So I took God's name and
brought Harshad here.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.880
Stop buttering me up with
this 'God' business.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.640
All this while, you were
living on god's mercy.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.640
But now you'll have to
work with the law.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.160
Harshad...

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.640
...the one crore that you gave the PM...

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.720
...did you tell anyone about it?

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.600
Not yet.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.120
- But I can prove it.
- It's my job to prove.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.680
I'm your lawyer.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.240
And listen, now...

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.920
...the police, CBI...
whatever they ask...

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.080
'You will not talk to them
without consulting me.'

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.720
'Do you understand?'

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.120
In 1991, between 2nd and 4th November,
you made some large withdrawals.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.600
Ten lakh rupees from Grindlays Bank,
Fort branch.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.520
Thirty lakhs from SBI's main branch.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.880
And two withdrawals in Delhi
on 4th November.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.200
Forty-five lakhs.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.680
What were you doing with
so much cash?

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.800
I don't remember anything.
These are very old transactions.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.640
It's a big amount, Mr. Mehta.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.640
Try to remember.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.200
Look, this might be a big amount for you,
not for me.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.480
I really don't remember.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.720
Let me know if you remember.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.280
You shouldn't have uttered
a single word there.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.600
Why did you let him speak?

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.480
- Don't you understand?
- But what did I say?

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.280
Didn't you say that you
don't remember anything about the money?

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.960
So 'I don't remember'
doesn't mean I said anything.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.960
You have no idea how they can turn this
'I don't remember' into evidence.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.520
Thank God CBI's interrogation
is not admissible in court.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.080
Or you would have let
the PM off the hook.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.880
Anyway.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.680
I will take care of this Das.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.080
How?

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.560
To Mr. KS Das, CBI Chief.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.080
The cash withdrawals
made by my client...

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.360
...Mr. Harshad Shantilal Mehta...

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.320
...between 2nd and 4th November,
1991...

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.640
...about which CBI questioned him...

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.720
...are politically sensitive in nature...

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:39.000
'...and Mr. Mehta can disclose details
regarding them...'

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.920
'...only if he gets immunity
from political persecution.'

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.680
- Kiran?
- Yeah?

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.320
Did you read Business Standard's
new story?

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.120
- What story?
- They have published a letter...

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.000
...that Jethmalani wrote
to the CBI chief.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.320
In it, he alleges that Harshad
might have paid off someone...

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.840
...very powerful in the government.
Around one crore or something.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.160
Calls it politically sensitive.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.000
Do you have any idea who it might be?

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.640
'So now you're creating
rumours in the press also?'

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.120
I don't take such risky short positions.
I am the big bull.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.760
For now, I've just created a rumour.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.000
But you never know... the Prime Minister
might lose both his value and his government...

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.960
Do you really think, if this nonsense
goes public, it will make a difference?

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.160
Do you think...

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.640
...you've been sent here
to drink orange juice?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.480
You're here to negotiate, right?

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.360
All the cases against us
should be withdrawn.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.160
Mr. Harshad Mehta,
we don't have a magic wand...

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.800
...which can make everything
disappear overnight.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.680
Income tax, CBI, press,
everyone is after you...

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.400
I know... Everyone is after me.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.320
Sometimes I feel, they'll even accuse me
of the bomb blast at BSE.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.360
CBI is already threatening me with
COFEPOSA.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.160
They'll charge me with TADA too.

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.200
There has to be some middle ground.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.080
You just keep your mouth zipped.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.560
I'll see how you can be helped.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.400
I want it in writing.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.520
In writing?

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.880
- Is this Mr. Jethmalani's idea?
- He's our lawyer.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.320
Naturally, he will think
about our safety.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.280
I want it in writing.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.920
It's impossible to give
anything in writing.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.960
'This is all that we can offer.'

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.040
Now you decide.
What would you like to do?

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.640
With this kind of a crowd
and this kind of a heat...

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:14.360
...let me put an end to all the
speculations and make it official.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.400
The scam was encouraged...

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.360
...initiated and sustained
by the government.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.960
The money of rupees one crore was paid
to honourable PV Narasimha Rao...

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.800
...the Prime Minister of India.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.000
And the suitcase and the money
was left with Mr. Khandekar...

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.640
...the personal assistant
to the Prime Minister...

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.760
...at the Prime Minister's suggestion.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.120
People don't give any human name
to scams.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.280
But if a human name is to be given
to this scam...

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.320
...it is not the Harshad Mehta scam.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.760
It is a PV Narasimha Rao scam.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.560
