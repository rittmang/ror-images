00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.640
Is everything okay?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.040
What do I say?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.000
You tell me.
Is everything okay at work?

What do you mean?

Your business is beyond

But I do understand that all the
newspapers are writing about you.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.080
So let them.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.880
It's worthless news.

- So, let them earn too.
- I'm scared.

It feels different this time.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.840
What's different?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.840

To be honest, I can't even
spell 'Einstein'.

It's new.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.240
These days, people are also calling me
the thief of the stock market.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120
The newspapers refer to me as
"Big Bull"...

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.800
"Big Bull has run away
with 500 crores from SBI."

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.360
They mean
I have swallowed up SBI's 500 crore.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.840
If at all I had to swallow money,
why just 500 crores?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.120
Huh?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.360
The money market sets up a daily buffet...
of two lakh crores.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.200
So imagine. What Harshad Mehta's
daily transactions would be!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.400
But they aren't taking my name.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.000
They just write "Big Bull".

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.600
Well, everyone knows,
I am the Big Bull.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.920
[Harshad] 'Hmm?'

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.160
But what does my being the Big Bull have to do
with the reconciliation of security transactions?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.080
Indirectly what they're
trying to say is...

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.440
...that I am responsible
for the bull run in the market.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.640
Okay. That's fine.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.200
But that also means...
if it wasn't for me...

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.360
...the market would be lumbering along
at the pace of a bullock cart?

-[Harshad imitating sound of a bullock cart]

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.280
The truth is that
the newspapers have no proof.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.360
That's why they aren't
taking my name openly.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.080
Because there's no truth
in what they're saying.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.360
I took 500 crores from SBI.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
Yes, it's true. I did.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.880
But I also returned it.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.760
How about printing that?
Hmm?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.560
But they won't.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.400
Because, if it's not negative,
it's not news.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.760
The newspaper needs to sell, right?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.000
They too have homes to run, don't they?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.640
But their baseless and biased news
doesn't scare me.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.040
Why should I be scared?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.400
Because I've broken
the monopoly of foreign banks in the money market?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880
In Mumbai...

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.800
...every morning when the gong is struck
at the stock market...

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.720
...my name is chanted along with it.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.720
This is Bombay.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.240
Here, everything will change...

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.640
...but the ocean will always be there.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.280
So, I am the ocean
of Dalal Street.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.680
If you have the guts,
you can taste the salt.

[crowd applauding]

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.480
They say the market
will reopen on the 28th.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.800
The strike will be over.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.080
If the SEBI chairman had
already accepted their demands...

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.760
...then what was the point of stretching
the strike on for so long?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.560
- Ashwin <i>Bhai</i>, I think...
- Your thoughts are absolutely right, Bhushan.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.560
The publishing of this article,
the extension of the strike...

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.520
It's all been too
well-planned and timed.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.160
So that, as soon as the market opens
the sentiment is low and it crashes...

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.640
You and I get it,
but we are duffers, right?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.680
But this fellow...

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.040
...a genius,

"Einstein" of the market.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.680
His brain has stopped working.
Look at him.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.120
You should've heard his speech.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.920
That Sucheta Dalal didn't take any names.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.680
But he... he confessed publicly...

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.840
"I am the Big Bull of the market."

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.200
- A round of applause for him.
- Confessions are made by criminals.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.560
I only stated facts.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.920
And that too, only so that nobody
can take a stand against us.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.960
And what is wrong
with what I said?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.840
What do we have to hide?
What should I hide?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.880
Now, even SBI has confirmed
that they've received their money.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.360
So? What's the issue?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.720
Then, why don't you also tell everyone
where the money to repay SBI came from?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.360
- Right?
- Ashwin <i>Bhai</i>...

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.920
[Rajdeep] 'Therefore, I was saying
it's not a front-page story.'

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.360
What will the follow-up story be?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.480
Harshad is admitting
that he took money from SBI.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.600
'Even to me, it seems like a daily deal
that he does regularly with banks.'

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.880
'Even SBI officials are
saying the same thing.'

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.920
Soon, people are going to
question us...

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.360
...about our motive!

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.040
Harshad is making us look
like a f*****g gossip magazine.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.960
- But Harshad needs to be brought to justice...
- Listen to me, Sucheta.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.320
Harshad is a hero.
A hero for the common man.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.720
His clients, his investors.
He's making profits for them.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.320
People are inclined
to believe whatever he says...

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.280
...in spite of
what we write against him.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.840
[Rajdeep] 'Instead, why don't you
write about...'

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.640
'...the never-ending brokers' strike
at the BSE?'

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.280
- What are you even saying, Rajdeep?
- Yeah.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.120
No. This is a good story
and you know it.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.480
I'm sure you've read the article
that appeared in Times of India?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.040
Yes, sir. The Big Bull
and the securities reconciliation issue.

- Big Bull!

Great! So, what's new?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.120
We knew this could happen.
And yet, we did nothing.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.240
We were suspecting this
for a year, now.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.640
Sir, we had issued guidelines
last year, sir but...

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.920
What... What guidelines
are we talking about?

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.240
This one?

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.760
"Any instance of return of SGL form
from the PDO..."

"...should be immediately brought

"...with the details
of the transactions."

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.600
I'm sure, half the people
didn't even get it.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.520
And the rest...

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.600
They just wiped and flushed it.

We? Why "we"?
You can blame me directly.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.320
I'm not blaming you, Sucheta.
I'm not blaming.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.600
I was just saying, that maybe...

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.680
...if we had investigated more...

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.920
...researched a bit more
then we could've...

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.200
See, what I mean is that...
if we could have found someone...

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.520

then we'd have...

This is too much.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.520
There's no chance, Rakesh.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.280
Even if it holds today...

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.160
...in a few days,
it'll drop below 3000.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.880
The downward trajectory
has only just started, brother.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.160
Wait and watch.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.080
This time, Harshad is finished.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.280
[Maheshwari chuckles]

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.600
We shouldn't be hasty
and go on a buying spree.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720
We have to be stealthy, like a fox.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.480
Look. This time, we were lucky.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.840
All our losses will get
converted into profits.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.760
True... Our a***s were on fire!

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.960
It's good
we only singed some p*bes.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.680
You have no control over your tongue,
nor your bladder.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.360
- I was just...
- What nonsense!

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.360
I...

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.640
We scraped through this time
but this can't go on.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.920
I think...

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.600
...this is the right time
to get out of this casino and retire.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.760
- Retire?
- What are you saying?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.600
We planned all this,
only to stay in the market.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.680
And you're talking of
leaving the market?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.120
I'm not talking about
leaving the market.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.720
Today, I have decided...

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.480
...to free myself
from this trading mess.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.240
If I need excitement, thrill,
I'll go to Vegas.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.680
Right?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.480
From now on, only value investing.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.800
Just value investing.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.400
And...

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880
I'll pick good companies, good shares...

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.560
...invest big amounts...
...and just wait for long term.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.800
Day to day trading is nonsense.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.640
Focus on the big dream...

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.640
...and make millions.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.400
- Maybe billions.
- Maybe trillions.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.680
What are you guys
talking about?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.760
This is the perfect time
to trade in the market.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.440
Look, Mehta will soon be
out of the market.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.160
Sensex will drop
from 3000 to 2500.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.160
And after that, the profit lies in buying.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.400
See, I can't explain the story
of long-term in short.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.920
In 20 to 25 years, the market
will rise to...

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.920
...35,000 to 40,000.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.520
It's not going to
go from 3000 to zero.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.040
This is the time to be a bull.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.640
Gone are the days of playing Bears
and nibbling peanuts.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.240
- Hey, <i>Bhai</i>...
- Don't "Hey <i>Bhai</i>" me, I'm talking sense.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.160
If my prediction is correct...

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.320
...then who knows,
I could be the next Big Bull.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.200
Sure.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.280
[Bhushan] 'We're past 4000 now.'

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.200
The market has sunk so low...
...the Sensex is scraping the floor.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.520
The share market has turned
into a fish market.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.320
Are you listening?

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.600
Up until last year,
everyone was buying.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.480
And today, all of a sudden,
the whole world is selling.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.160
Our jobbers were petrified.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.680
As if they were going to be
bashed up by the angry crowd.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.400
- Everyone is scared.
-[Ashwin] 'Of course they are scared.'

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.800
'Why won't they be scared?'

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.040
The market has dropped by
more than 500 points.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.320
And Polo... Polo has dropped
to 510 from 300 in a snap.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.480
- Brother, we need to think of a strategy soon.
- Strategy?

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.920
What kind of strategy?

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.600
All we are running on, is hope.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.840
And we're slowly losing that too.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.080
Now start thinking how will we
repay NHB's money?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.160
Is this the first time
you are seeing the market fall?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.720
[Harshad] 'It has opened after a long time.
It's obvious it'll dip.'

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.320
It'll lick some dust
and rise again.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.640
And have you forgotten?
We started with a crash.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.800
[Harshad] 'What's new about it?'

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.720
What's new, Harshad,
is that this time...

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.240
...we are the reason
for the crash.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.560
Even better.
We're the kings of the market.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.840
If we can cause it to fall,
we can make rise it too.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.520
The wind is blowing
in Harshad's favour.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.840
And it will change its course
on our command.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.120
And now after this crash,
how will we return Pherwani's money?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.360
You do know how big
the amount is, don't you?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.800
[knock on the door]

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.360
[Kashmira] 'May I come in, sir?'

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.800
Kashmira, I told you
I don't want to get disturbed today.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.960
Sorry, sir. But, Mr. Rahil
is on the other line...

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.480
...and he insists on
talking to you.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.640
- Connect me.
- Okay, sir.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.240
Hello, Rahil.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.840
- How are you?
- I'm... I'm fine.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.800
Have you seen
the condition of the market?

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.000
Yes. So?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.480
[Rahil] <i>'No, I mean... your men
asked me to invest...'</i>

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.600
...and I did. I invested all I had.
I'm deep in it now.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.960
Rahil, I call the stock market,
shock market sometimes.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.200
It can deal a real blow.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.960
At times you make a profit,
at times you incur a loss.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.200
That's what business means, right?

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.560
You're lecturing me
about the market?

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.160
What do I know about
the stock market?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.880
You said, your men said...
'Invest, invest, invest...' So, I did.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.000
[Rahil] <i>'It's all over now.'</i>

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.880
Rahil, this is the stock market
not a treasure chest...

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.880
...that you dip your hand and pull
out a fortune, when you like.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.680
And this money that you invested,
you earned it in the market, right?

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.920
So, the market took
some of it back.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.440
[Harshad] <i>'I didn't take your money.'</i>

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.480
I... I get your point, but...

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.840
Look Rahil, you are a friend...
...so I'm explaining patiently.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.080
I have many clients.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.240
I can't explain
to each one, can I?

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.240
We'll talk peacefully
some other time.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.280
Bhushan, don't smoke here!

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.560
[Tyagi] 'So, how much
did the Sensex fall today?'

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.240
- Fell by 570 points.
- [Tyagi] 'Wow.'

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.160
That's 12.77 per cent
to be precise.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.320
Never before in the history of BSE...

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.400
...has it dropped so much
in a single day.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.440
[AK] 'That's more than 10 percent
investor wealth wiped out.'

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.080
And I believe, most of them
are Harshad's investors.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.480
Hmm...

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.320
And yet, Harshad managed
to repay SBI.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.080
All 500 crores.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.440
I just wonder who funded him?

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.480
Whoever it was,
will be exposed soon.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.600
I believe the sensex will
be discussed in the Parliament too.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.640
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.320
Politicians are on this, AK.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.160
Harshad has taken too much
money from the market.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.280
[Tyagi] 'And he has to return
it all. And due to this fall...'

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.480
...his holdings have been halved.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.200
It's time to put an end
to this Harshad Mehta story.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.560
<i>'Today the members
of the parliament debated...'</i>

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.640
<i>'...the sudden crash
at the stock market yesterday...'</i>

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.360
<i>'...that resulted
in the biggest Sensex fall ever.'</i>

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.080
<i>'Under pressure from
the opposition leaders...'</i>

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.480
<i>'...the government announced...'</i>

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.840
<i>'...that RBI
will probe the event...'</i>

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.000
<i>'Today, the members of the...'</i>

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.240
[phone ringing]

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.120
- Hello?
- Harshad...

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.040
Listen to me carefully.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.840
[Pherwani] <i>'Your 15 days are over.'</i>

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.840
I need my money back.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.360
Pherwani <i>ji</i>,
why do you worry so much?

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.720
Worrying is my job.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.600
I owe you the money
and you'll get it.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.480
Harshad, you are not understanding.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.520
RBI has formed
an enquiry committee...

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.840
...to inspect your transactions
with the SBI.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.720
[Pherwani] <i>'Do you understand
what this means?'</i>

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.480
It means that these guys can
land up any time at my doorstep.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.800
[Pherwani] <i>'And I don't want that.'</i>

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.760
I want my books clean, that's it.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.480
[Pherwani] <i>'Either you
organise funds...'</i>

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.920
...or ask Grindlays to give BRs.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.720
Look, I've understood the problem.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.520
Please trust me.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.040
[DT] 'The market was bound to react.'

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.040
His whole confession of him being
the Big Bull from your article...

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.040
...is just another
"Harshad Mehta is a liar" trick.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.160
[DT] 'I'm telling you, he's already
looking at huge losses.'

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.240
Do you think even after
making such losses in the market...

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.400
...he is going to stop?
He's not going to stop.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.040
No, you're right. He's not...

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.160
...unless you prove that
this entire activity is illegal.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.720
Now, it seems like Harshad took
a loan from the bank...

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.280
...and he returned it.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.400
Albeit, a bit late.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.360
What if we change
the question itself?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.200
Maybe then it will
be difficult to answer?

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.320
Look, if people think it was a loan
of 500 crores, that's okay.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.880
But to return that, where did he get
500 crores in such a short time?

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.240
He has enough assets, holdings.
He literally knows everyone.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.120
[DT] 'I mean... half of Delhi
dances to his tune.'

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.000
Right. Exactly. So, he must've sold
something, right?

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.320
But he didn't. Officially, Growmore
has not done any deals.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.880
[Sucheta] 'It's a matter
of 500 crores.'

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.520
'Everybody in the market
would get to know about it.'

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.160
Are you saying,
he went to another bank?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.680
If SBI was f*...

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.000
...fooled by him.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.720
Then he must have repeated
the same thing...

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.760
...with several other banks
again and again.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480
B******t.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.440
Okay.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.040
Do you think you can find out
which banks he has gone to?

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.280
I get your point, but...

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.480
...what will you do with
just the name of the bank?

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.560
I want to print
just one more headline...

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.080
...that will get imprinted
in people's minds forever.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.120
I need another Bellary
to grab this Big Bull by his horns.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.040
'Mr Mehta, we are talking
about an extended line of credit.'

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.320
'Under the present circumstances...'

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.800
'...it is impossible for Grindlays
to give you this kind of money. '

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.000
Then the other option is that
Grindlays gives BRs to NHB...

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.360
...for the money
that they have paid.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.800
It's funny you say that.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.200
We credited all the NHB cheques
into your account.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.920
See, all I am saying is to give BRs
worth 500 crores to NHB.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.960
They just need it
for documentation purposes.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.480
And it's just
a piece of paper, right?

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.960
It's not just a piece of paper.
Not any longer.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.480
We have strict instructions
to stop all security transactions.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.280
There could be an audit any day.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.440
And is this really this urgent?
It's Sunday.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.520
I don't wanna talk business
on a Sunday.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.840
I understand that.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.200
In fact, I just came here
to play some golf.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.160
I saw you here,
so thought of discussing.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.960
Well, why don't you try a shot,
Mr. Mehta?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.600
Why not?

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.200
Sometimes, you have to be
more delicate.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.280
It looks like you don't know
how to play golf.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.440
Yeah, I play cricket a lot.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.680
I think I need to stretch my body
a little bit.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.480
Mr. Mehta, your mind missed the shot.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.480
Not your body.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.880
Maybe, you should just stick
to the game you are good at.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.040
Harshad, we've fallen
out of the frying pan into the fire.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.960
We don't need to hold our holdings
till they hatch.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.200
Let's clear NHB's settlement.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.480
It's not any other private bank.
It's a part of RBI.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.200
And that governor, he's already
pissed at you.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.560
Sell the holdings and end this.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.880
I've heard that these days you
can set up a golf green at home?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.800
You find out.
We'll get one too.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.680
If we have to play their game
we'll have to learn it, right?

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.280
What was that he said?

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.120
"You have to be delicate."

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.520
[dog barks]

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.400
Why should I be scared
when you are with me?

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.040
What will I do single-handedly
if some goons...

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.200
[knocks]

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.880
This has all the names.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.880
'I got the list
from Growmore.'

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.560
Thanks.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.120
Okay, but my name mustn't
appear anywhere.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.720
- My job will be at stake.
- I don't even know your name.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.920
How can I leak it? And don't worry.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.840
I know how to protect my sources.
Your name won't be revealed.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.600
Okay.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.320
Let's go, uncle. That's enough
for tonight.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.280
Sir, Harshad's SBI scam is nothing.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.640
Every bank has some irregularities
with regard to securities.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.200
-[Ghosh] 'I think that...'
- Ghosh...

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.880
How big is it? Number?

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.880
Sir, the books are
in a complete mess.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.400
It'll take time to figure out
the exact number, sir.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.760
What are you waiting for?
Get on with this.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.520
This is the list of
all the banks...

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.520
...with whom Harshad was dealing
for the past few days.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.040
- And?
- And... So...

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.240
...is there anyone, who can
give us some leads?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.160
I mean, someone
who works in any of these banks?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.040
"Us"?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.440
Oh, you mean, someone
who can give "you" a lead, right?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.240
Debu, this is a potential common
lead for both of us.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.240
You can write a detailed,
and well-researched article later.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.000
But I need to break this story
as soon as possible.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.920
- But if you don't wanna help me...
- Okay... Okay...

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I'll look for someone
who can get us the details. Okay?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.240
Okay, thank you.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.120
Thank you.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.720
I think you gentlemen
should also leave now.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.120
Sir, you should also rest.
You are taking a lot of stress.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.920
Yes, of course,
I'll just finish this and go home.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.320
Should we clear the table?

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.880
No. I'll manage.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.920
- Carry on.
- Good night, sir.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.960
Soon, it will be Good Morning.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.800
Anyway, thank you.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.480
[Venkitarajan coughs]

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.320
[Venkitarajan] 'Sorry to disturb you
so early in the morning, sir.'

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.080
But our estimates were right.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.440
My team has just come back after
the preliminary enquiries and...

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.600
Yes.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.160
It is India's biggest financial scam.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.080
Five thousand crores.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.480
But...

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.840
Yes, sir... I do understand, but...

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.880
Sir, the only way to handle this
is to make it public.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.280
Y-Yes... of course.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.040
Yes, sir.
I will keep it discreet. Yes.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.360
Thank you, sir.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.120
Sorry... I slept...
Did you find anyone?

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.640
Yes? Did you find anyone?

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.640
Here.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I didn't.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.600
But News Press did.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.760
[Debashis] "According to the
sources, the extent of the scam..."

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.200
"...is expected to be
in the region of Rs. 2000 crores."

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.280
"And they suspect that the remaining
3000 crores gap..."

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.520
"...is probably caused by banks
including certain securities..."

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.160
"...in their report that may not
be part of the SGL records."

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.920
Where is News Press
getting these details?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.800
I mean... I've spoken to a hundred people
in the last ten days...

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.520
...and no one's even uttered a word.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.480
They may have
some confidential source.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.800
All the sources are not like
your 'Karamchand', right?

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.920
No.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.760
It's a major source.
Someone in the system, and very senior.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.280
They've netted some big fish.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.880
And this big fish
has opened his mouth.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.240
[Ghosh] 'Sir, I hope
you read the news.'

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.600
Yeah.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.160
- Sir, Delhi is in panic.
- Good morning.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.160
The finance minister's office
has been calling incessantly.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.040
- What do they have to say?
- Sir, nothing much.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.640
They'll only speak with you, sir.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.680
Alright, I'll handle it.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.760
This has never happened before, sir.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.920
I mean, the RBI governor
holding a press conference...

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.200
...in reply to a newspaper article.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.520
This could give rise to more
speculation and more questions.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.920
It's the Press, they are
bound to ask questions.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.200
And moreover, there
could be some questions...

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.120
...which we might not
have answers to.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680
[Man1] <i>'You need not answer
every single question.'</i>

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.400
<i>'You just need to deny that
the scam is of such proportions.'</i>

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.280

can shake anyone.'</i>

<i>'...as this article says.'</i>

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.960
Honestly, sir,
how can I do this?

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.320
I mean, on what basis
do I deny so many facts? Huh?

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.360
I mean, how can I deny
something that is the truth?

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.520
Something that is now...
now in my knowledge.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.840

The cheques that Mr. Mehta
gave you...

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.880
- Those...
- Those cheques have been cleared.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.240
So, have you cleared them
off your books too?

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.640
Meaning?

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.960
Meaning, you don't have the cheques,
but you must have the details?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.760
[Mukherjee] 'Show me the records.'

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.120
There's Mr. Mehta.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.120
Look, he has an account with us,
he does business with us. He can...

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.320
He can always withdraw as much
money as he wants to.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.320
But you transfer the money
to his account, right?

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.840
So, maybe you would like to
show us...

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.120
...the transactions
to his personal accounts then?

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.640
