00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.860
Money, rupees one crore was paid
to honourable P.V. Narasimha Rao...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.620
...the Prime Minister of India.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.820
He's just selling lies,
as he has always done...

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.980
...to divert the media's attention
from the scam to the Prime Minister.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.100
It is not the 'Harshad Mehta scam'.
It is the 'P.V. Narasimha Rao scam'.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.020
And if both sides keep giving statements,
problems may arise.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.420
[Sucheta] 'Even if Harshad was lying,
he was denting the image of those in power...'

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.380
'...and everyone was aware that a solution
was necessary.'

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.140
Mr. Mehta, you said,
that you have a visiting slip...

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.100
...dated 4th November,
for the Prime Minister's residence.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.660
Yes. That is right.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.140
But I can't find that slip.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.620
[Das] If you contradict yourself...

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.540
...you don't really have
any case against the Prime Minister.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.180
[Das] 'I hope you understand.'

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.860
[Sucheta] 'Curiously, Harshad
began to contradict himself.'

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.380
'His claims and accusations against the
Prime Minister could never be proven...'

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.620
'Was Harshad trying to let off the
PM as part of a deal? Nobody knows.'

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.380
'But the matter fizzled out.
Harshad was never charged for dealing in narcotics.'

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.060
'But now, Harshad was banned
from the stock market...'

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.540
'...and the market continued its free-fall.'

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.300
'The Sensex dropped from
4461 in April 1992...'

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.700
'...to 2000.'

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.940
'Those who had lost everything
in the market crash...'

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.060
'...for them...
Harshad Mehta was really a liar...'

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.500
[loud thud]

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.940
The police have been informed.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780
You just need to sign here.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860
Why is he here?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.740
Ask him to leave.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.460
How did this happen?

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.180
[Rahil's wife] 'How did it happen?'

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.500
I don't know.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.460
You don't know?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.900
You knew everything.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.460
[Rahil's wife] 'You were the smartest,
weren't you?'

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.700
This man...

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.620
...he didn't know anything.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.940
Whenever I asked...

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.660
...he would say, "Harshad knows.
Harshad knows everything".

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.420
So, tell me Harshad Bhai.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.900
Who killed him?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.980
It may look like suicide to you.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.980
But the truth is, you killed him.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.340
You destroyed him.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.660
- Let it be.
- You had killed him a long time ago.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.660
Today is just the funeral.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.500
And listen!
He's not the only one.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.460
You've killed many people
like him.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.820
We invested money on your word.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.660
[Rahil's wife] 'We trusted you and...'

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.580
...you say, you don't know?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.260
What don't you know?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.300
What do you not know!

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.660
[Rahil's wife sobbing]

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.140
[Title Montage]

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.900
It's a nice view.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.700
Yes, the view is beautiful.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.820
When you were away from home,
you must have missed this view?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.820
You mean, when I was in jail.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.940
Not this view,
but I did miss my point of view.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.260
Because my point of view was
never printed/ captured.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.100
Come.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.060
[Harshad] 'Have some snacks,
before we start.'

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.220
CBI and IT are so fond of our
snacks that...

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.980
...sometimes they raid me
just to eat some snacks.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.020
- Can I keep it here?
- Sure.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.020
And your taste is similar.
So, I'm sure you'll like it too.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.420
You seem to know a lot about me.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.300
In the market, you've to keep
a tab on both friends and enemies.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.020
So, am I a friend or an enemy?

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.660
You know that best.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.100
I think you'll know it soon too.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.900
I'm sure.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.020
- Shall we start?
- Yes...

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.100
So, Mr. Mehta, you were
the common man's hero.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.220
And many people in the market
trusted you.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.140
But then, when you were away,
they lost their trust...

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.300
...they lost their life savings,
and a few of them even lost their lives.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.940
So, what do you feel given the losses
that people faced because of you...

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.300
The loss of confidence in the market...

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.060
...can it be restored?

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.060
I'm asking you this because...
if you are able to return to the market...

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.620
...can you resolve this crisis?

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.580
Are you still capable of it?

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.300
You see...

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.460
There is a misunderstanding.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.900
I am not that capable.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.340
I really am not.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.140
In fact, I want to remove
this "I" part of it.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.460
I have never said that I'm so capable.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.300
[Harshad] 'Look...'

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.140
'I know, many people have faced
huge losses because of me.'

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.100
In spite of the fact...

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.580
...that I have nothing to do
with the market fall directly.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.580
We always had a policy...

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.660
...that no one must incur
a loss because of us.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.940
No individual and bank should suffer
because of the dues...

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.340
...of Harshad Mehta.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.100
You want me to believe this?

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.660
You want me to believe...

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.380
...that you feel guilty for the losses
you caused to small investors.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.820
Really, Mr. Mehta?

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.060
Look, I told you what I feel.
I expressed my guilt.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.420
Believing it or not, is up to you.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.660
I can't force you to believe this.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.900
Though, I would like you to believe.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.860
And if it's about losses, then...

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.620
...I am suffering too, aren't I?

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.260
There's only one way to resolve
this matter as soon as possible.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.300
We'll request the special court...

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.700
...that we're ready
to settle all the claims.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.380
'The settlement commission
will take care of everything.'

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.340
And they have all the powers
to grant immunity.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.380
If the commission agrees...

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.100
...gets convinced...

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.300
...all your assets
will be released.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.060
'But, Mr. Mehta...'

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.380
...please don't get
attached to these assets.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.620
These days, the special court is more
attached to my assets than I am.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.900
This CBI...

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.300
Do they have nothing better to do?

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.580
Now, they've slapped a new case.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.060
[Bhushan] 'This is the charge sheet.'

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.500
They just don't want us
to get out of these cases.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.260
As soon as they heard about
the settlement commission...

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.700
...they're threatening
us with charge sheets.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.700
They want to silence us.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.700
This is ridiculous enough to give
fever to a donkey.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.300
They say, settlement commissions
can grant immunity...

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.460
...only for future prosecutions.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.940
[Bhushan] 'Not for ongoing cases.'

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.780
[Harshad] 'There's no doubt that CBI
has handled my case in a unique manner.'

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.980
Unique manner?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.180
You feel like you've been
discriminated against?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.180
Yes, I have been
discriminated against.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.300
Just look at my case.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.820
In my case,
they have notified my entire family.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.460
I have never seen that before.
You can check for yourself.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.020
Today, I am left without any assets
or money... virtually.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.660
Plus, they've filed
so many cases against me.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.260
Usually, every case has one FIR.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.500
But when it comes to me, they've
filed seven FIRs in every case.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.860
[Harshad] 'And look at the number
of agencies going behind me.'

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.580
RBI, CBI, IT, ED, JPC...

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.860
The Income Tax Department
filed such a big case.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.020
Ten thousand crores.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.980
[Harshad] 'Isn't that ridiculous?'

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.020
But, you know
what my biggest crime is?

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.940
That I'm Harshad Mehta.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.060
[Harshad] 'Why are you rubbing
your nose in these law books?'

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.220
'Are you planning to quit the business
and become a lawyer?'

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.060
Business?

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.940
What business?

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.420
Bhai, now only we know the law,
do we stand a chance.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.980
Because, given our situation...

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.860
...if we don't become lawyers,
we won't be able to do business.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.460
[Ashwin] 'We have the CBI
cases to defend.'

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.460
IT department is slapping penalty
after penalty. We've to defend that.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.300
And our custodian...

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.860
[Ashwin] 'His math is all
over the place.'

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.780
'His office has not even done
the accounting correctly.'

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.980
Bhushan was saying, they've
undervalued all our assets.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.860
Bloody idiots.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.700
[Harshad] 'Let the custodian do
what he wishes.'

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.540
Let him set the values.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.140
The custodian is value-less himself.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.140
You know what I think?

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.220
This is the right time
to start something new.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.060
Go ahead.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.780
Start something new.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.340
But this time, it's not just a
matter of our assets or of money.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.980
Our name is at stake, Harshad.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.420
When 'Nathhu' gets rich,
people start calling him 'Nathalal'.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.380
Once we have money, the name will follow.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.140
That's not how you build a name.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.660
People are calling us thieves.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.460
All these cases...
we have to fight against them all.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.740
We have to fight against the system.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.380
We'll have to clear our names
from all these cases.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.020
Or else...

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.100
Forget us, people won't even
leave our children in peace.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.380
So, do you think...

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.700
...you'll read a few books, and
become a lawyer in a couple of days?

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.180
Do you think, all these cases
will be over in a couple of days?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.700
Can I ask you something
off the records?

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
It's been three to four years...
and I still wonder...

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.180
...who got
this verbal diarrhoea?

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.380
[Harshad] 'Who turned this into a story?
Who is this source?'

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.300
I never reveal my sources.
I think it's unethical.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.900
Of course. I understand.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.100
But now this matter is old,
it's stale. How does it matter?

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.180
So? Mr. Mehta, I take my sources
to my grave.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.380
I'm just trying to understand...

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.060
...if your source had
a personal enmity with me.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.100
Did he have a problem with me?

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.900
[Harshad] 'Huh?'

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.740
The systemic loopholes and irregularities
that everyone was exploiting...

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.340
...calling them a scam...

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.820
...maybe he used you
against me..?

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.500
Use?

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.500
Mr. Mehta, I report
strictly based on facts.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.740
I'm here because I think it's necessary
to get your side of the story too.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.740
[Sucheta] 'Because I believe you need
a fair hearing too.'

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.700
Fair hearing?

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.540
Your source told you something then...

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.780
...you believed it and printed it.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.740
And now, when the whole world
is pointing fingers at me...

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.820
[Harshad] '...when I'm in trouble...
Now you talk about a fair hearing?'

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.660
I tried talking to you even then.
But you were in denial.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.340
Back then, you probably felt
that no one can touch you.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.420
These things you say...
about being fair and unfair...

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.100
...do you think I don't understand
what you mean?

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.780
When it comes to one's gain,
nothing is fair or unfair.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.780
You see, in business, it takes time
to create fortune...

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.100
...and timing to kill it.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.700
In your business of journalism, it is
the same, isn't it? It's all about timing.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.740
You and your source
timed it very well.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.140
Mr. Mehta, I am not in the business
of journalism.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.660
I write stories based on facts.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.660
Stories that are important.
Stories that matter.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.700
Whom do they matter to?

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.140
The judiciary? The public?
The system?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.820
It doesn't matter to anyone.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.100
- Nobody gives a f**k.
- I give a f**k.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.420
Because of this blatant misuse
and blatant arrogance...

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.700
...the whole system is f****d.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.940
- You seem offended...
- Mr. Mehta, I think we are done.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.580
I hear, that you're writing
a book on this "scam"?

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.580
Do show it to me
before you publish it.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
I'll do a fact-check.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.820
[Debashis] 'Finally!'

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.500
Done with this proofreading.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.500
Sometimes I feel, we should've taken
Harshad's suggestion.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.820
He could've helped.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.420
All these numbers and figures...

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.940
Just cross-checking them
can leave one confused.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.260
And then, we would have to name him
in the acknowledgements too.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.180
Oh yes.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.540
- That reminds me...
-[Sucheta] 'Hmm...'

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.300
We'll have to thank 'Karamchand' too.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.220
Can you stop
calling my source 'Karamchand'?

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.860
- You know I call him DT.
- Oh, yes. Deep Throat. Yeah...

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.620
You could've come up
with something original.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.540
[Debashis] 'You just stole it
from All the President's Men.'

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.180
So, you think that is original, huh?

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.420
They also stole it,
for your information.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.220
You don't know anything.
Please go and do some research.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.300
I will.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.980
But I don't need to call
your source DT...

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.020
...because I know his real name.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.180
- Really?
- Of course.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.260
A couple of meetings between
you both...

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.180
...and I had figured who this
"Deep Throat" is...

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.340
- Yeah... I know...
-[Debashis] 'You don't believe me?'

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.100
No.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.820
I can tell you his name right away.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.340
- Can you?
- Yes.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.780
- Tell me.
- What if I tell you?

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.660
- What?
- What do I get in return?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.780
Return? You're a journalist.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.500
Since when did the journalists start
thinking about returns?

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.060
Come on!
There has to be some reward.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.020
I kept mum all this while in spite
of knowing your source's name.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.660
Okay. Fine.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.100
What do you want?

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.700
- With henna, keep your hands decorated
- Debu, please...

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.300
With flowers, keep the palanquin decorated

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.340
Oh, my God, Debu.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.860
To take you away fair maiden,
your beloved will make this journey!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.300
Is there a point to this?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.180
Marry me.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.260
Tell me the name of my source, first.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.660
Your source has helped so much.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.260
We have to thank him in the book,
don't we?

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.740
Number 36. Mr. Anil Khurana.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.540
[Auctioneer] 'Next car.'

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.140
Number 20. Mr. Raja Duggal.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.420
[knocks the gavel]

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.300
...My duties as Prime Minister...

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.260
[Sucheta] 'In 1996, Harshad had
a stroke of luck once again.'

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.180
'Prime Minister Rao was
relinquishing his seat'.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.100
'Harshad was no longer perceived
as government's enemy number one...'

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.820
'He had also got relief
in a few cases.'

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.740
'His mind was at work again.'

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.540
Five years ago we were to
destroy Merill Lynch...

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.860
Along the way, we got destroyed.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.580
Seventy-two criminal cases.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.060
And more than 600 civil cases.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.820
I'm bigger than
a don of the underworld.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.660
[Harshad] 'But yes... This might put me
in the Guinness Book of World Records.'

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.460
Don't laugh. This is a fact.
It's not a joke.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.100
And you are amazing.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.300
When the going got tough...

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.700
Hey, idiot!

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.900
Because of you, CBI, IT...
...they had made my life miserable.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.540
I wasn't allowed to even s**t in peace.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.980
[Pranav] 'I know how to keep a low profile.'

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.180
That is why I'm fine. I'm happy.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.300
But you...

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.300
You are Bachchan.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.900
New people have entered
Bollywood and the market.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.340
Now the era of both, Amitabh Bachchan
and Harshad Mehta, is over.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:03.940
Darling...

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.180
...time doesn't go anywhere.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.660
Rather, it brings with it.
Experience.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.380
And experience has its own value.
Get it?

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.060
True. Experience does have value.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.180
That's why I'm planning to
write a newspaper column.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.820
About the market.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.580
What to buy, when to sell,
I'll advise people.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.660
-[knock on the door]
- Come in.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.580
What is this?

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.260
[Peon] 'This is
from Harshad Mehta's office.'

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.140
'The delivery boy said you'll know,
that this is for you.'

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.780
- Okay, thank you.
-[Peon] 'Okay.'

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.460
[phone ringing]

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.780
- Hello?
- Did you get the photographs, Sucheta ji?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.420
Mr. Mehta,
if there's an article about you...

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.700
...then I have many pictures of you.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.300
I don't know
why you're sending me all of this.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.540
How can I tell my boss
what to do?

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.340
What?

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.260
[Harshad] 'Looks like
nobody has told you anything.'

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.860
Fine, I'll tell you.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.020
You're going to be my boss.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.820
[Harshad] 'From next month, I am
writing a column in your newspaper.'

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.700
And since you're the editor
of the finance section...

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.780
'...that makes you my boss, right?'

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.860
So, I thought, let my boss
select the photograph...

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.260
[Harshad] '...that will go
with the column.'

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.220
[Harshad] 'I'm not writing this column
just to pass time.'

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.380
This is a strategy
to remain in the public eye.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.380
One should always remain
a topic of conversation.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.220
Welcome, Mr. Nair.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.980
- Hello, good morning.
- Good morning.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.540
[Nair clears throat]

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.820
- Sit.
- Thank you.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.340
Ashwin, meet Mr. Nair.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.460
Senior media manager.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.660
He's helping me get the column
at Times of India.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.260
Sir, there's a problem.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.340
Top management has some issues
with your column.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.540
They are not sure whether they want
to publish it right away or not.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.020
You mean Sucheta Dalal
has a problem with my column.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.340
But sir, we've found a solution.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.260
There's a Hindi newspaper
Navdesh Samachar...

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.300
...they are ready to publish your column.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.380
[Nair] 'It also has wider reach
among your investors.'

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.580
'Mostly, the smaller ones.'

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.020
"Mr. Mehta..."

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.420
"...some people say
that your best days are behind you..."

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.460
"...while others look up at you
as the market guru."

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.380
"What is the secret behind this?"

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.820
"There is no secret."

"It's all about practical experiences."

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.140
"I've had this exposure
of multiple businesses."

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.300
"And I am fortunate enough to have
worked on the floors of stock market."

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.340
"I have dabbled both in stock markets
and money markets."

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.540
"And I'm sure, no MBA or businessmen
would have similar experience."

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.940
"So, my advice are more practical
than bookish."

he is likely to invest in..."

"...or he should invest in?"

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.140
"There are lots of stocks."

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.540
"I have identified a few of those."

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.420
"Would you like to identify
five of them for us?"

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.860
"The five stocks..."

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.300
"...that in the long term will yield
dividends to its investors."

pay the price for it."

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.980

Do nothing, and still look busy.

[Harshad] "So, here is what I've done."

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.580
This all that he wants to do.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.460
[Harshad] "We have created

Dhananjay ji, these boys
are your future, right?

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.700
Yes.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.220
...in the same way,
this is the market's future.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.100
Now for tips, there's no need
to go to the market and...

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.140
...have endless cups of tea
and sandwiches.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.500
With this computer, you can get tips
and also trade, from home.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.340
Did you understand?

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.060
Harshad Bhai...

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.620
...do you have a telescope
attached to your brain?

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.500
[Broker 1] 'How do you see
so far into the future?'

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.700
The market really misses you.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.540
Just rock the market this time.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.860
Look, buddy, I've seen the worst.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.660
All the accounts are suspended.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.260
We don't know what surprises
are awaiting in these cases.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.100
But I have some plans
for the future.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.740
Harshad Bhai, doing
business in the name of Growmore...

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.260
I mean, we have no problem...

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.660
...Don't misunderstand me,
but in the market... you know..?

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.260
How... how will we do it?

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.180
Look, buddy.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.060
The problem is the name, right?
So we'll change the name.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.380
But only if we want to grow more.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.220
[Harshad] 'Yes, buy the shares
of Videocon.'

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.260
You can buy them from Calcutta.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.620
[Harshad] 'Buddy, give it some string.'

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.460
'The wind is blowing
in the right direction.'

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.540
This needs to remain high
like a kite. Steady.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.100
Okay.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.420
Come in.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.020
Do you need something, Bhushan?

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.140
Why? Did I disturb you?

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.180
I need to talk to you.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.580
Everyone has a hawk's eye on us.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.020
We're trading after a long time.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.660
[Bhushan] 'You're pushing up
the prices of BPL and Sterlite.'

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.860
If someone even suspects...

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.500
We had made a mistake, right?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.860
[Harshad] 'So, I'm moving forward
learning from those mistakes.'

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.260
I will only take it as high
as I can handle.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.100
But if something changes
out of the blue, what can I do?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.340
"At 15:45 hours, India conducted..."

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.300
"...three underground nuclear tests
in the Pokhran range."

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.060
[Sucheta] 'At the peak of Harshad's
leveraged position...'

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.020
'...India conducted
a nuclear test in June 1998.'

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.140
'Foreigners panicked, pulled out money
and the market simply melted.'

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.780
[phone ringing]

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.300
- Hello?
- Hi.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.980
Do you remember,
I was telling you about the stocks...

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.860
...of Sterlite, BPL and Videocon
and how their prices were shooting up?

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.660
-[DT] 'Hmm.'
- So, all of their prices...

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.300
...drastically fell
after the market sank.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.740
[DT] 'I know.'

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.700
So, now, the rumours are...

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.780
...that there are some
Damayanti group of companies...

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.140
...that were rigging their prices.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.260
And now they have
a huge payment default at BSE.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.260
[DT] 'Okay, so?'

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.380
So, I found out that
instead of forcing them to pay up...

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.460
...the people at BSE are
actually helping them.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.260
I mean, they've lowered the margins
in the scrips they control...

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.180
...and they are arm-twisting other
companies to cover their payment default.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.580
Unbelievable.
Why is BSE even allowing any of this?

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.780
That too, for some unheard-of company.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.500
Exactly what I thought.
So, I did some digging.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.700
And, looks like BSE is taking
instructions from our old friend.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.260
Who? Harshad?

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.060
Who else? Half the people at BSE
are still his devotees.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.100
They opened the trading system
in the middle of the night...

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.780
...to insert synchronised
trades at prices...

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.140
...that were completely out
of line with the day's trading.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.380
But why is Harshad trying
to bail out this Damayanti group?

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.020
I don't know. Harshad and Growmore...

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.740
...don't seem to have any
connection to these stocks.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.220
- Unless...
- Unless...

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.020
...Damayanti Group is
in some way connected to Harshad.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.180
Exactly.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.580
What do you want from me?

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.020
We have to pull out all the details
of this Damayanti Group.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.260
Can you help me?

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.500
All the Damayanti Group of companies
have the same address.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.740
It's 1208 Maker Chambers 5,
Nariman Point, 400021.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.980
Growmore Research
and Asset Management Limited?

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.340
Thank you. Exactly.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.140
And these four people...

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.740
...Dilip Shah, Vinod Shah,
Anil Doshi and Dinesh Doshi...

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.500
...are directors of this
Damayanti group...

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.260
...in various permutations
and combinations.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.820
Okay...

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.700
Do you know who they are?

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.020
Jyoti Mehta's brothers.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.860
Jyoti is Harshad's wife?

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.340
The outlaw has started a company
in the name of his in-laws.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.020
Exactly. We finally have evidence
linking Harshad to Damayanti.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.060
You know what?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.300
Let's just give all of this to SEBI.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.020
Unlike last time,
they are no longer toothless tigers.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.180
They have all the powers.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.300
Let them investigate.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.980
Okay.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.780
Who had travelled from Mumbai
to Delhi on 27th February?

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.980
Harshad Mehta?

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.300
[Accountant] 'No, sir.
It was one of our employees.'

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.540
Look, the ticket has been booked
in his name.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.380
Just call up the airline and confirm...

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.260
...if Harshad Mehta travelled
to Delhi on this date.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.020
Sure, sir.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.740
[SEBI Official 2] 'Many calls
have been made to this number.'

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.780
And, many calls have also been
received from the same number.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.100
- Whose number is this?
- Sir, I don't know.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.060
Sir, here are all the contract notes.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.060
BPL, Videocon, Sterlite.
Keep it carefully.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.860
Sure, sir.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.100
[Sucheta] 'It was established that
Damayanti Group was set up by Harshad.'

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.020
'No one even tried to
cover their tracks.'

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.380
'By cornering of shares
and price manipulation...'

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.380
'...they created an artificial market
which ultimately crashed.'

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.260
How come you aren't ready yet?

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.460
Don't you have to go for
your TV recording today?

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.940
There won't be any recording
for a few days.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.740
With all the things going on...
It won't look good...

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.100
That is fine.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.780
But you didn't even exercise today.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.460
The doctor has advised you
to exercise every day.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.620
Then?

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.220
Come on.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.940
Run a little.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.700
I've been running for years now.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.940
Look, I'm still running.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.220
I'm tired now.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.860
I just want to rest now.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.500
I need some peace.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.660
For peace, you need to
first calm your mind.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.860
You think too much.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.500
Stop thinking.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.300
Then everything will be fine.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.940
And...

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.420
By the way...

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.620
...if you want peace,
you can always think about me.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.140
Okay, let's try that.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.100
Anyway...

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.900
I have nowhere to go now.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.260
There's no need to go anywhere.
Stay here... with me.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.380
My time might be up, anytime now.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.060
[Harshad] 'And I might have to go...
soon...'

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.580
Why are you saying
such scary jinxed things?

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.300
You advise everyone else
to always think positive.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.220
I'm just joking.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.540
Look at me...

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.260
What's going to happen to me?

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.020
- Come on, make some tea for me.
- No, I won't.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.020
Quickly make some tea
before something happens to me.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.980
I'm not leaving you alone.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.380
You're all dressed up, as if
you were going to be recorded today.

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.020
Is it nice?

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.420
[Ashwin] 'Bhushan?'

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.580
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. I didn't have much work, so...

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.860
Why? What happened?

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.740
The custodian has sent the report.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.340
- Report?
- Yes.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.740
The one which comes periodically...

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.620
- ...about liabilities and assets?
- Oh... Yes...

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.180
An entire lot of shares
is missing, Bhushan.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.060
I mean, it's in my records
but not in their reports.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.060
They must've messed it up
during the audit.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.860
I'll look into those reports again.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.380
Almost 27 lakh shares are missing.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.700
Approximately worth 300 crores.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.500
Here...

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.420
Look at this...

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.660
Did you come across this mistake before?

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.180
Ashwin Bhai, there are
assets worth 2,000 crores...

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.020
...and liabilities worth 16,000 crores.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.700
And god knows, how many shares
of how many companies.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.580
Just maintaining the records
curdles my brain.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.180
And you have seen how they keep
the shares in the custodian's storeroom.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.140
I hope they haven't
misplaced those shares.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.100
Misplace?

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.660
But don't worry, Ashwin Bhai.
I'll check all the records again.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.420
May I go?

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:55.820
Are you in a hurry?

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.820
No... We'll leave together
if you say.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.060
Go.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.300
See you.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.420
[Harshad] 'How can 27 lakh shares
go missing from the records?'

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.900
- Your figures are never wrong.
- No, they aren't.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.260
But you know. Bhushan
maintains the records of all the assets.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.180
He is the one who checks all the reports
of the custodian.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.660
But I think, with age, his brain
has stopped working.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.300
[Ashwin] 'I don't know
what goes on his mind.'

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.100
Thankfully, I checked the old
records and spotted this mistake.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.460
Bhai, we must inform
the custodian as soon as possible.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.260
No, wait...

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.900
He's crazy.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.900
He'll suspect us instead.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.900
Let's ask Bhushan. Let him check them again.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.220
Bhai, Bhushan and you
don't understand the law.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.140
In none of the previous reports
from the custodian...

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.220
...are these shares mentioned.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.620
But, they're showing in our records.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.020
I've checked them myself.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.260
I feel, in '92, when we were
both in custody...

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.940
...that's when this mistake
has occurred in the records.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.820
[Ashwin] 'I feel we should go
tomorrow, and complain about this.'

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.140
It's 300 crores, Bhai.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.260
If we delay even a little...

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.620
...the custodian might
blame this back on us.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.340
[Ashwin] 'Even if the problem
might be in their records.'

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.060
If we find these 27 lakh shares...

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.700
...our liability will be
reduced by 300 crores.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.020
- Three hundred crores?
-[Ashwin] 'Yes.'

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.860
Okay.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.980
- Tell me.
- We have just one request.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.260
Please locate all these shares...

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.900
...and restore them in our names,
with all the benefits.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.660
First tell me,
which shares are we talking about?

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.740
And how did they go missing?

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.860
In 1992, during the case...

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.020
...the court had attached
all our assets.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.860
There were two to three storerooms
full of shares.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.580
And among them, were
these 27 lakh shares.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.300
Two to three storerooms?

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.580
How can two-three storerooms full of shares
be misplaced by the custodian?

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.100
What are you trying to say?

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.900
That we've stolen our own attached shares?

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.500
- That's what you mean, right?
-[Custodian] 'Please calm down.'

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.020
We'll do an investigation.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.500
'Your record is unique, anyway.'

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.500
There are so many
on-going investigations.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.700
What's one more?

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.140
What is it, Bhai?

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.700
What have you done now?

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.660
What did we do?

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.460
Why does the CBI want
to interrogate me?

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.580
Why did they call me again?

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.180
It's nothing. Calm down.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.380
We spoke to the custodian
about those missing shares.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.300
That a*****e must've told the CBI.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.140
[Harshad] 'So now, CBI is enquiring.'

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.740
'Or they are pretending to enquire.'

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.260
It's not a big deal.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.220
They'll question
a few employees. That's it.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.260
That's it?

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.900
You should've spoken to me
before going to the custodian.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.780
[Ashwin] 'Spoken to you?'

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.380
Meaning?

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.060
Ashwin Bhai,
if CBI troubles me, then...

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.140
[Harshad] 'Hey!'

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.860
Sit down and speak calmly.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.180
- Sit!
- I don't want to sit!

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.140
Then talk.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.260
The shares aren't missing.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:43.900
[Harshad] 'What do you mean?'

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.300
I sold those shares.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.660
You sold them!

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.180
Those shares were
attached by the court.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.780
[Ashwin] 'What do you mean you sold them?'

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.460
Have you sold your brain too?!

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.140
The court never attached those shares.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.940
When I gave the list of assets,
I didn't include those shares at all.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.020
Then as we have often done,
I transferred all those shares...

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.660
...to a front company
and sold them off at the open market.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.740
A*****e!

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.820
Were they your father's shares,
m**********r!

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.620
How can you f**k us over
being one of us?

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.100
[Bhushan] 'I..?'

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.300
'I f****d you over?'

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.060
'I f****d you over?!'

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.180
All this while I've been
kissing your a**!

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.420
CBI was pissing on my face.
What did you expect me to do?

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.940
You have so many assets
and properties.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.420
What do I have?
An empty drum!

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.740
When you were not getting bail,
it felt like the end.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.220
I also have a family.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.900
I have to think about them.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.340
So, I sold off all those shares.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.460
Whatever amount I got,
I kept.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.100
[Ashwin] 'We trusted you so much!'

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.460
We believed in you like a brother.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.460
Even I had taken Harshad for
a brother, Ashwin Bhai.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.500
I believed in him,
and joined Growmore.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.860
Tell Ashwin Bhai...

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.420
...when you came to me
with the offer to join Growmore...

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.300
...what did you say, you m**********r!

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.580
Do you remember
or should I remind you?

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.620
You told me,
"I want to create history. "

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.380
"You need 100 employees
who will give their 100 percent..."

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.140
"...then, I'm 1,000 percent
sure I'll create history."

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.220
"But only Bhushan Bhatt can be
the commander of those 100 people."

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.380
"We are old partners."

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.180
"You can take whatever you want.
Join hands with me."

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.380
[Bhushan] 'I joined hands with you.'

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.620
Harshad, you created your history.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.260
But I was going to be history.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.340
Did you make me a partner in the company?

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:50.100
Forget partner, you f**king
made me an office-clerk!

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.140
Are you even worthy
of being a partner?

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.300
Do you have the b**ls?

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.740
You are a f**king coward.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.500
And what are you crying about?

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.420
You haven't made less money.
You too have minted a lot.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:18.340
Look Bhushan, because of your f**k up,
I'm not going to go to jail this time.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.020
You a*****e, CBI will think that
I've done another scam.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.460
Do you think I want to go to jail?

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:31.940
You deserve to be in jail.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.580
- The CBI will arrest you.
- Don't threaten me with CBI!

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.140
- Bhushan, you m**********r!
- Ashwin Bhai!

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.580
Who will tell CBI?

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.500
The two of you?

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.780
Mehta Brothers?

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.500
Ashwin Bhai,
what was that?

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.300
The pot calling the kettle black..?

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.620
You have so many front companies.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.220
[Bhushan] 'You have transferred
so many shares to them.'

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.780
If CBI gets to know, it won't
end well for anyone, Harshad.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.780
It would have been better if these
shares had remained missing.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.820
Bhushan, I want my money.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.380
You won't get it.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.300
Hmm? You won't get it.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.100
Do what you can.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.820
And if you have the b**ls
then prove...

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.220
...in court that you own these
shares and take them back.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.140
Get out! Get out of here!

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.700
[Ashwin] 'Get out! M**********r!'

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.580
Bhushan, you M**********r!
I'm still in the market.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.700
I'll have you paraded naked.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.340
F*****g b*****d!

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.460
Sir, I'm an honest employee
in Harshad's company...

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.780
...I do what my boss asks me to.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.140
But your boss wants those shares back
which were never in the record.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.420
You handle the records of all
Growmore assets, right?

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.660
- Isn't it? Tell me.
- Yes.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.380
Where have those shares disappeared...

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.060
...if neither Growmore
nor the custodian have them?

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.980
The brothers have secretly sold all
the shares in the open market.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:51.420
Sir, in 1992 when the custodian
attached Harshad's assets...

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.300
...Harshad did not declare those stocks.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.620
And after he got out of jail...

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.740
...he transferred all the shares
to front companies.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.980
And between 1993 and 1995...

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:17.860
...he gradually introduced these shares
in the market and sold them.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.340
When Harshad had not declared
those shares...

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.820
...why did he go
to the custodian?

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.420
Sir, you know Harshad Mehta.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.100
He has fooled everyone, from
the share market to the Prime Minister.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.460
This time too, he thought he'll blame it all
on the custodian and get away with it.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.700
This is his new scam, sir.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.820
[Amitabh] 'I welcome you all.'

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.300

'I am Amitabh Bachchan and you're
watching "Kaun Banega Crorepati".'

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:02.860
'Thank you.'

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.060
There was a time when
I was the Bachchan of the market.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.020
I used to earn millions
for the common man.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.900
Now Mr. Bachchan
is making common men millionaires.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.460
Even Mr. Bachchan
had to move...

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.500
...from the big screen to the small
to make a comeback.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.020
If we want to make a comeback again,
we should also start small.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.500
There you go. Bhabhi.
Do you have anything to say?

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.900
Small is as risky as big.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.540
And risk is...

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.700

You live in big houses,
drive luxurious cars.

Does that give you the power
to use us?

Did anything happen then?

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.740
We took it to the
Supreme Court, didn't we?

This time too,
they can't keep you in jail for long.
