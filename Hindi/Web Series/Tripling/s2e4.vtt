WEBVTT

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:45.658
Brandy!

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:48.956
Brandy!

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.559
Brandy!

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:59.715
Brandy! Brandy! Brandy!

00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:05.363
Brandy! Brandy! Come here.
I will give you candy.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.285
Brandy!
- Chitwan!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.995
Baba, are we lost?
- Yes.

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:16.939
Brandy!
- Brandy

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.408
Brandy!

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.165
Brandy!

00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:23.820
Brandy!

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:25.492
Brandy!

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:28.298
Where are you, dog?
- Chitwan.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:29.799
Language.

00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:33.625
Baba, I only called the dog a dog.
- You could have said doggie.

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:35.754
Lord knows where Brandy must be.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:40.176
If it becomes dark we will
never be able to find Brandy.

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:43.105
I'm sure a tiger or
a bear will eat him up.

00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:49.785
If it becomes dark,
the bear might even eat us.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.543
Baba, bears don't eat us.
They are our friends..

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:55.823
..just like Balu is Mowgli's friend.

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.046
If I find a bear I
will dance on his stomach.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:09.530
Chanchu, don't cry.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.353
Brandy will be found.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.721
Baba, he might be at home.

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:19.052
He keeps going out
and then he returns home.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.537
Just like me.

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:21.993
You must have taught him.

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:26.355
It is possible.
- It is certainly possible

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.415
Let's go and check before it gets dark.

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:30.779
Shall we?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.121
Let's go on that.
We'll get home quickly.

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:01.090
Yes!

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.995
Let's race the dark.

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:04.214
Come on.
Come on.

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:14.510
Road trip!
- I hate road trips.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.347
Why?

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:21.302
When we have holidays papa
takes us on a road trip in the car.

00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:23.891
Then half the vacation
is spent in the car..

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:25.483
..and one has to listen
to everyone prattle.

00:03:25.563 --> 00:03:28.773
Chanchal, you should
get your head out of the car.

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:31.583
It gets so windy you can't hear a thing.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:35.829
That's what Brandy and I do.

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:38.877
Do you know why papa
takes us on road trips?

00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:39.650
Why?

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:42.311
So we may spend time together as a family.

00:03:42.552 --> 00:03:45.209
The family spends time
together even at home.

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:46.894
Everyone is busy at home.

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:49.110
For example, mummy and papa go to office.

00:03:49.527 --> 00:03:51.076
We go out to play in the evening.

00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:52.848
Then we sleep at night.

00:03:52.928 --> 00:03:56.188
Mummy and papa argue
at home all day long..

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.175
..and they vent all
their frustration on me.

00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:01.805
Our parents argue less than other parents.

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:03.732
Baba, you don't know anything.

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:06.325
I've stood outside their
room and heard everything.

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:08.345
They even badmouth you.

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:09.954
Me?
- Yes.

00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:13.948
What do they say?
- Chandan is very bad at studies..

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:17.597
..but he looks so innocent I
don't feel like scolding him.

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:20.248
That's why they have to vent
all their frustration on Chitwan.

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:22.264
You are such a fibber!

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:22.994
Scoundrel!

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:24.501
Try sitting on the cycle now.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.737
Wait and watch.
I shall let you fall.

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:27.179
Baba, don't swear at me!

00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:28.287
I will tell mummy.

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:31.042
Then your road trip will be cancelled.
- Road trip again?

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:36.059
Do you know,
my friends go on their holidays by air?

00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:39.268
By plane.
- Flying?

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.816
Do the two of you want to fly as well?
- Yes!

00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:44.390
Look up in the sky, okay.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.338
Not right,
not left, not the front or the back.

00:04:46.581 --> 00:04:48.008
Just look at those clouds.

00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:51.602
Watch how I help you enjoy
a plane ride on the cycle.

00:04:52.904 --> 00:04:54.869
Whoa!

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.353
It is great fun!

00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.619
Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.352
Whoa!
Whoa!

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.065
Keep looking up.

00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:10.751
Oh, yeah!

00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:11.904
Whoa!

00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:14.277
Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:17.949
Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:21.538
Baba, we are going to fall!
- Chitwan, don't look in front.

00:05:21.618 --> 00:05:23.968
Just look up.
- Baba, there's a cow in front!

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.854
Damn!

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:34.182
Sorry.

00:05:38.117 --> 00:05:41.225
Baba, did you fall asleep while driving?
- Yes, I guess.

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:42.710
What?

00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:44.360
I told you we should stop at Jharkhand.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.880
We should rest and freshen up.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.642
That place is dangerous

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.157
Sleeping while driving
too is pretty dangerous.

00:05:50.335 --> 00:05:52.513
Let's park at the side and freshen up.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.635
You want tea?

00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.827
You want to smoke some
cannabis to freshen up?

00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:00.165
Tell me.

00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:01.507
You want water?

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.409
Baba. Baba.

00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:07.400
You know when I nodded off in the car.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.597
I had a dream too.

00:07:09.687 --> 00:07:10.821
Of Kathgodam.

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.892
You remember we were looking for Brandy?

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.820
Yes, and she was at home the whole time..

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:16.360
..while mom and dad were looking for us.

00:07:18.065 --> 00:07:20.952
Do you remember the cycle we
were on before falling into the pit?

00:07:21.032 --> 00:07:21.848
No.

00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:24.183
We crashed into a cow.
- We did not crash.

00:07:24.263 --> 00:07:25.222
I saved us.

00:07:25.365 --> 00:07:27.716
You did today, Baba, but not that day.
We did crash.

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:30.652
I only remember the fall
and I was hurt very badly.

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.413
You remember the red colored medicine?

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:35.878
I'd applied that over here.
- That used to burn.

00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:38.340
What are you saying?
We did not fall

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.712
I had saved us.
I skid with the cycle.

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:41.922
Sure.

00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:44.766
You be the hero in all the stories, okay.

00:07:46.384 --> 00:07:49.642
Distort our entire childhood
in your next book and sell it.

00:07:51.013 --> 00:07:51.873
You are funny.

00:07:51.953 --> 00:07:52.833
Everything is going well..

00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:54.493
..you are needlessly ripping me apart.

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:56.029
Funny!

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.896
Really? What do you mean
everything is going well?

00:07:58.266 --> 00:07:59.463
My husband is missing.

00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:01.031
We are running from the Police.

00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:03.249
All three of us are sitting
on the banks of the Ganges arguing.

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:04.352
And you claim everything is going well.

00:08:04.432 --> 00:08:06.312
Chanchu, this is not the Ganges.
It is Hooghly.

00:08:08.686 --> 00:08:11.865
Baba, you better think
before you write about my life..

00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:14.833
..because whoever much I feel
at home I can't go back to jail, okay.

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:16.343
I'm a family man now.

00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:28.063
Okay, but seriously, stop using our lives.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.928
We have copyright over our lives.
- But it is my life too.

00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:33.477
What about my copyright?

00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:36.240
Baba, why don't you..

00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:38.707
..remove Chanchu from it?

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:42.030
Write a story about two brothers.
Nice adventure!

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:43.692
I am the player and you are ignorant.

00:08:43.972 --> 00:08:44.745
Why remove Chanchu?

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.965
You said you didn't
want to be in the book.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:50.679
Who is this?
- Probably your film friends.

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.514
Your parents.
- Listen. Listen.

00:08:53.654 --> 00:08:55.526
Don't tell them.
They don't know anything.

00:08:59.287 --> 00:08:59.932
Hey, guys!

00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:01.461
How are you?
- Shut up, Chandan!

00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:03.762
Pranav is missing?
- Huh?

00:09:04.918 --> 00:09:07.482
Put your goofy expression
aside and tell me the truth.

00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:08.420
What's the matter?

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:09.553
Matter?

00:09:10.036 --> 00:09:11.119
Hi.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.860
Chitwan, you bloody fool!

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:14.634
You have a son?
- Huh?

00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:16.205
These two are oafs.

00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:17.563
Where is Chanchal?

00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:20.896
Hi.
Hi, guys

00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:23.252
Chanchu, are you okay?
- Yeah, mama. I'm fine.

00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:25.129
There are strange stories on twitter.

00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:27.870
Some woman on TV called
you a deadly woman.

00:09:27.989 --> 00:09:29.556
I don't know what's happening.

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:32.857
Any news of Pranav?
- No, but we're following a lead.

00:09:33.842 --> 00:09:36.109
Why are you in Calcutta?
- How did you know?

00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:37.654
I can see the Howrah bridge at the back.

00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:40.236
Oh, yeah.
So cool!

00:09:40.634 --> 00:09:43.151
Actually Pranav came
here to eat sweet dumplings.

00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:44.305
What nonsense!

00:09:44.463 --> 00:09:46.314
Will one of you give us a proper answer?

00:09:46.632 --> 00:09:48.385
No, you give me a proper answer first.

00:09:48.725 --> 00:09:49.944
How do you know I have a son?

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:53.598
We have received 1500 messages
from a lawyer called Sheetal.

00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:56.175
I don't know if she is concerned or
if she wants to slap a lawsuit on you.

00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:57.671
Sheetal tried to contact you?

00:09:57.878 --> 00:09:59.695
What the hell!
- Language!

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:03.703
Mom.
Dad.

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.563
Do not worry.
The three of us are together.

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:06.543
We'll figure it out.

00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:07.901
Okay?
- We can forget about it then.

00:10:08.497 --> 00:10:10.250
Where are you?
- In a Hotel.

00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:11.948
In transit.
We are coming.

00:10:12.414 --> 00:10:13.925
Naughty.
- Shut up!

00:10:14.443 --> 00:10:16.659
Listen. Please don't panic, okay.

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:17.724
Just enjoy your vacation.

00:10:17.907 --> 00:10:20.794
To hell with the vacation!
- Mom. Language.

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:23.436
Look, we are arriving
in India in three days.

00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.949
Just stay out of trouble until then.

00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:26.324
Please.
- Okay.

00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.669
They disconnected.

00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:32.771
Wow!
- Now?

00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:35.047
Brother.

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:36.766
Excuse me.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.829
Why is he saying brother
in that awful accent?

00:10:40.402 --> 00:10:41.938
You remember there was
a British guy in 'Lagaan?

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.179
Where is Tollygunge?

00:10:46.998 --> 00:10:47.758
Brother.

00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:48.956
Brother.

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:50.140
Tollygunge?

00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:51.976
Tolly-gunge.

00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:53.033
Where is it?

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:54.743
Toll.
Gunge.

00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:56.827
Is it on that side
of the bridge or this side?

00:10:57.341 --> 00:10:58.372
Tollygun..
Okay.

00:10:58.578 --> 00:10:59.492
Do you eat sweet dumplings?

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.384
Where will I find
the best sweet dumplings?

00:11:03.336 --> 00:11:04.844
What a guy!

00:11:09.374 --> 00:11:10.349
Take a left up ahead, Baba.

00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:13.271
Is this left or..?

00:11:14.117 --> 00:11:15.474
Crap!
- What happened

00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:16.288
What happened?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.734
I'm getting a busy
tone on Sheetal's phone.

00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.893
She's probably snitching on someone.

00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:21.727
That's why he likes her.

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.203
The two of them play snitch.

00:11:23.353 --> 00:11:24.457
Snitching couple.

00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:27.912
How am I a snitch?
- You don't snitch?

00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:29.642
You are not a snitch?
- When?

00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:30.547
What do you mean by when?

00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:33.986
Do you remember that time Sameer
Saxena gave me a rose on rose day?

00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:35.850
This dog went and showed it to mummy.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.862
And what was that dance you
were doing in front of them?

00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:40.321
"Flowers and thorns.
Chanchu was hit with horns."

00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:42.429
I was fond of music since childhood.

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:43.982
Nonsense!
- And that boy was not good for you.

00:11:44.062 --> 00:11:45.905
He was a bad influence.
- Just shut up!

00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:48.757
What about the time you removed the
packet of cigarettes from my bag..

00:11:48.837 --> 00:11:50.031
..and showed it to mummy?
- I was only checking to see..

00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:51.380
..if you were smoking
a good brand or any old brand.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.757
Sure. You remove the cigarettes
at home to check which brand it is?

00:11:53.837 --> 00:11:55.061
You slapped me for it.

00:11:55.141 --> 00:11:56.346
Well, you deserve to be slapped.

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:58.992
I slapped you to prevent
you from getting spoiled.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.049
I was doing the same.

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:01.348
Preventing you from getting spoiled.

00:12:01.428 --> 00:12:02.723
Don't talk nonsense!
- You shouldn't be talking.

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:04.472
As though you guys
never complained about me.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.700
I've never done it till date.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.283
You should thank me for rescuing
you so many times in life.

00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:09.011
Exactly!

00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:10.794
When did you rescue me?
- When did we rescue you?

00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:11.397
When?

00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:12.581
You had planted a bomb in school.

00:12:12.661 --> 00:12:14.590
They were going to suspend you.
I saved you.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.680
I used to go talk to his
teacher for every PTA meeting.

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:20.082
Park the car at the side.
The car can't go further.

00:12:20.443 --> 00:12:21.411
We'll have to walk.

00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:23.103
What?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.303
Go walking from here?
- Walk.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.619
Chitvan are you sure?

00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:28.923
Otherwise you will get a slap from me.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.120
Oh. Now I am afriad.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.170
Want to have some digestive?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.688
Want to get slapped?

00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:08.215
He doesn't know anything.

00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:09.725
Do you have Pranav's photo?
- Yes.

00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:10.519
He's blind.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.710
Oh, yeah!

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:16.240
Do you have Pranav's voice note?
- Yes. One sec.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.920
Why are you seriously...

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.046
For how long has your
husband been missing?

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.575
What?

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:24.877
How many days has it been
since your husband is missing?

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.466
How is it your business, brother?

00:13:26.546 --> 00:13:27.599
Continue shaving.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:28.789
What brother?

00:13:28.988 --> 00:13:31.531
How do you know he
made the call from here?

00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:34.706
The person whom he called told us.

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:38.859
Her husband Pranav was asking for
recommendations of sweet dumplings.

00:13:39.683 --> 00:13:44.988
Then ask the person who he
called where he told him to go.

00:13:47.425 --> 00:13:48.681
Good point!

00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:50.898
It didn't even occur to us.

00:13:51.212 --> 00:13:52.625
It occurred to you?
Now give him a call.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.234
He has been missing for three weeks.

00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:02.009
Pranav. My husband.

00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:04.198
Can you help us?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.915
Yes, I can help you.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.334
I am a Private Investigator.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.361
You're a detective?

00:14:21.497 --> 00:14:23.156
I don't like that word.

00:14:25.762 --> 00:14:26.984
I am Satyen Bisht.

00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:30.011
One who looks for the truth.

00:14:31.032 --> 00:14:32.118
Baba..

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.357
What are you doing?

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.600
Chilla said that Pranav went to
Chitranjan sweet something.

00:14:48.824 --> 00:14:49.924
The sweet dumplings
over there are the best.

00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:52.479
I..
- Sweet store.

00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:55.581
Currently the sweet dumplings
over there are not the best.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.714
Not too good now.

00:14:57.139 --> 00:14:58.790
In any case Pranav's taste is bad.

00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:00.416
Can you give us the
directions to get there?

00:15:01.232 --> 00:15:02.378
The way there..

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:03.795
When you get out of
here there is a roundabout.

00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:06.290
You take a roundabout from there..
- Brother.

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:07.463
It's okay.

00:15:07.603 --> 00:15:09.391
We will find the directions on the map.

00:15:09.522 --> 00:15:10.618
What is the spelling of Chitranjan?

00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:11.421
Yes.

00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:14.575
These days with google
maps, facebook, instagram..

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.340
There is no appreciation here
for intellect and instinct.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.744
Anyway, the way to the sweet
store is right from there..

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:29.479
..and my office is to the left from there.

00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:31.853
Up to you.

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:36.306
Baba.

00:15:36.455 --> 00:15:37.895
Why are you thinking so much?

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.498
We will manage with the help of the map.

00:15:41.428 --> 00:15:44.668
In any case instinct becomes
slow after a certain age.

00:15:47.445 --> 00:15:48.557
He heard you.

00:15:57.877 --> 00:15:59.770
Sir, why don't you come in?

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:01.638
You want us to come out?

00:16:01.765 --> 00:16:03.484
I was just joking.
- He is walking fast.

00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:04.766
Let's to walk.

00:16:04.945 --> 00:16:05.646
Sir.

00:16:11.273 --> 00:16:14.940
Satyen Bisht?
- It is related to the truth.

00:16:15.073 --> 00:16:16.091
It's of no use to you.

00:16:17.717 --> 00:16:19.102
Come on, guys.
Catch up.

00:16:19.182 --> 00:16:19.909
Where did he go?

00:16:50.738 --> 00:16:52.317
Welcome. Welcome.

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.300
Come on in.

00:16:54.963 --> 00:17:02.002
Your brother Pranav went
to the sweet store 15 days ago.

00:17:02.937 --> 00:17:08.382
He bought 3 dozen sweet dumplings
and left in a yellow taxi.

00:17:09.273 --> 00:17:12.838
The taxi tire was punctured
in front of Liberty cinema.

00:17:13.352 --> 00:17:14.870
He crossed the road,

00:17:15.263 --> 00:17:18.287
went to an Axis bank ATM, withdrew money..

00:17:18.367 --> 00:17:21.259
..and threw the slip on the road.

00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:23.796
Hey, brother.

00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:25.546
You think we will
believe anything you say?

00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:28.046
Do I look like a jackass to you?

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:35.221
Just a second.
How do you know all of that?

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:39.074
You may not be aware but..

00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:43.782
I may be out of work
but I am not out of touch.

00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:44.886
You know.

00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:47.369
I have a very big network.

00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:48.549
Very many informers..

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:53.022
..from Nagaland to Mcleodgunj.
Rai Bareilly to Colombu.

00:17:53.102 --> 00:17:55.641
Russia. Korea. Indonesia.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.839
But here in Kolkata, it's main.

00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:00.359
Big stronghold.

00:18:01.925 --> 00:18:05.304
Actually I'm a celebrity, you know.

00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:08.114
Several books have been written on me.

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.941
Many films too have been made.

00:18:11.263 --> 00:18:13.352
They weren't made perfectly,
but never mind. It's okay.

00:18:13.432 --> 00:18:14.778
Then we are the same.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.034
Celebrity, celebrity.

00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:18.270
So where is Pranav now?

00:18:22.006 --> 00:18:23.925
That will take a little time.

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:29.305
And 30000 plus GST minus TDS.
- Done!

00:18:29.878 --> 00:18:30.633
Baba.

00:18:30.802 --> 00:18:32.292
At least bargain a little.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.379
He's right.

00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:34.505
Done means done.

00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:35.448
It's a deal.

00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:37.766
He would have agreed for 3000.
-Good!

00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:39.583
Okay.

00:18:40.797 --> 00:18:41.391
Okay.
Come.

00:18:41.471 --> 00:18:45.517
So, I must begin my work now.

00:18:54.389 --> 00:18:57.625
I want you to taste my homemade special..

00:18:59.026 --> 00:19:00.363
Will you have some?
- No, no.

00:19:00.554 --> 00:19:01.971
Of course.

00:19:03.377 --> 00:19:06.189
It will hit you where it hurts most.

00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:07.495
Remember.

00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:12.255
Nice?
- Nice.

00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:15.980
Also, please give me
a photo of brother Pranav.

00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:21.865
You had given up, hadn't you?
- Baba, a guest is akin to God.

00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:34.364
He

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:47.077
Rabindra Sangeet!

00:21:18.398 --> 00:21:21.055
All the students of
3rd grade to 9th grade..

00:21:21.135 --> 00:21:24.040
..please come to the
playground for PT class.

00:23:41.977 --> 00:23:43.755
What were you thinking?

00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:45.537
Do you want to go to jail?

00:23:46.308 --> 00:23:47.390
You want to be a goon?

00:23:48.548 --> 00:23:50.646
I'm printing out am
entire list of complaints..

00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:52.166
..against your son, Mr.
Sharma.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.264
You communicate with the
kids and try to understand them.

00:23:57.344 --> 00:23:59.620
All the principles of
modern parenting are failing.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.804
I'm telling you.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.742
I'm sorry for having contacted you..

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.798
..but your son is getting out of control..

00:24:06.297 --> 00:24:07.979
..and I really didn't
know who else to speak with.

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:09.921
You did the right thing, Sheetal.

00:24:10.267 --> 00:24:11.811
Chitwan doesn't tell us a thing.

00:24:12.252 --> 00:24:14.713
Chitwan didn't even tell
me I have become a grandfather.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.915
Chitwan has no right over my son.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.324
That child is from my previous marriage.

00:24:19.454 --> 00:24:23.159
But Chitwan loves that child.
- Chitwan is a naughty child.

00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:25.952
A very, very naughty child.

00:24:27.018 --> 00:24:30.006
And all this misbehavior
is nothing but crying for attention.

00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:32.622
And this is not acceptable.

00:24:33.173 --> 00:24:37.032
Madam, could you lower
the volume of that music?

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.793
He's playing live.

00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:43.203
And I like it.

00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:44.838
Look, my girl.

00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:47.662
Chitwan is immature, not irresponsible.

00:24:48.459 --> 00:24:50.047
His heart is in the right place.

00:24:50.493 --> 00:24:52.085
Well, I'm not quite sure of it.

00:24:52.755 --> 00:24:54.657
Because since the time he
caught up with his older brother..

00:24:54.737 --> 00:24:56.202
..he's been talking irrationally.

00:24:57.891 --> 00:25:00.939
I am afraid he might
start drinking alcohol again.

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:02.769
I understand what you are saying, ma'am..

00:25:03.384 --> 00:25:05.783
..and I am ashamed of my son's behavior..

00:25:06.569 --> 00:25:08.882
..but please don't remove him from school.

00:25:09.726 --> 00:25:12.281
He loves your son very much.

00:25:12.914 --> 00:25:14.693
Give him one chance.

00:25:15.469 --> 00:25:18.482
Actually these siblings
love each other very much.

00:25:18.623 --> 00:25:20.614
They love each other very much.

00:25:21.035 --> 00:25:24.630
Chitwan lit the bomb
because Chanchal was wronged.

00:25:24.762 --> 00:25:27.924
Ma'am, it is not Chitwan's fault.

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:29.614
I lit the bomb.

00:25:35.932 --> 00:25:36.650
Chitwan?

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.875
Chitwan?
- Chitu?

00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:38.889
Chitwan, wake up.

00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:40.710
Chitwan. Chitwan.
- Chitwan.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:41.868
Chitwan.
- Chitwan.

00:25:41.948 --> 00:25:43.418
Chitwan.
- Chitwan, wake up.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.255
Chitwan.

00:25:49.398 --> 00:25:50.084
Chitwan?

00:25:50.397 --> 00:25:51.276
Baba.

00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:55.018
Are you okay?
- Baba, bomb.

00:25:55.286 --> 00:25:56.156
What?

00:25:56.798 --> 00:25:58.569
The Principal removed
Chanchu from the band..

00:25:58.649 --> 00:25:59.938
..to replace her with his niece.

00:26:00.673 --> 00:26:02.245
That's why I lit the bomb.
- Chits.

00:26:02.325 --> 00:26:03.997
Chits. It's okay. It's okay.

00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:06.686
Hey.

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:08.733
You are dreaming of school.

00:26:10.957 --> 00:26:11.803
And Baba..

00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:13.743
..you're beautiful.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.245
Sleeping beauty, you are awake now?

00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:18.085
Hey, Satyavansham.

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:20.449
What do you mix in the hooch, brother?

00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:22.605
Everything was mixed up in my dreams.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.944
Anyway, Chits,
hurry up and wash up and pee.

00:26:25.024 --> 00:26:25.721
We have a long way to go.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.665
Come on.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.310
What does it mean?
What is she saying?

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.234
Meaning that Pranav is in Sikkim.

00:26:29.314 --> 00:26:30.627
We have to go there.
- Let's go.

00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:31.934
How do you know?

00:26:32.572 --> 00:26:36.528
I sent the photo to all my informers
and they gave me all the news.

00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:40.455
Brother Pranav bought sweet
dumplings and went to Soma market bank.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.623
From there he bought a ferry ticket..

00:26:42.703 --> 00:26:45.120
..and went straight to
Howrah station ferry terminal.

00:26:45.307 --> 00:26:47.298
He got off there.
He was in a big hurry.

00:26:47.548 --> 00:26:48.754
He said the train was at 2:15.

00:26:48.894 --> 00:26:50.852
2:15 means Shatabdi.

00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:53.513
From there he went straight
to New Jalpaiguri station.

00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.561
Over there he got on the bus to Gangtok..

00:26:57.196 --> 00:27:00.588
..after buying snacks from my informer.

00:27:01.108 --> 00:27:02.560
So simple!

00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:03.940
Case solved.

00:27:06.021 --> 00:27:06.650
No.

00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:08.262
One for the road.
- No. No. No.

00:27:08.342 --> 00:27:09.361
On the road..

00:27:09.654 --> 00:27:10.091
No. No. No.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.759
No.
- It will have a reverse effect.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:13.536
You will sober down.
Don't worry.

00:27:16.074 --> 00:27:17.645
No, no.

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:19.459
Anyway, the problem has been solved?

00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:23.996
Chits, our problem is solved
but your problem remains.

00:27:25.232 --> 00:27:26.540
What problem do I have?

00:27:27.705 --> 00:27:30.323
Sheetal called repeatedly
when you were asleep.

00:27:30.501 --> 00:27:31.125
What?

00:27:31.344 --> 00:27:33.069
Crap!
Crap!

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.498
27 missed calls?

00:27:36.313 --> 00:27:38.011
I'm screwed!
- Language!

00:27:46.163 --> 00:27:46.961
Hi, Sheetu baby.
How are..

00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:47.668
Chitwan.

00:27:48.483 --> 00:27:49.349
Where?

00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:50.987
I've been trying to reach you all day.

00:27:51.662 --> 00:27:52.250
Listen, Sheetal.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.901
Look, I know you are very upset with me..

00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:55.537
..but even I am very upset with you, okay.

00:27:55.617 --> 00:27:55.958
Please.

00:27:56.038 --> 00:27:57.717
Let's play this lover's tiff game later.

00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:58.729
Right now I need your help.

00:27:59.218 --> 00:28:01.778
What happened?
- He isn't sleeping.

00:28:01.942 --> 00:28:02.709
Handle him.

00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:04.448
Do your duty as a father.

00:28:10.595 --> 00:28:11.675
Cheetu!

00:28:12.213 --> 00:28:13.687
Cheetu! Cheetu! Cheetu!

00:28:13.823 --> 00:28:15.158
Don't cry, baby.

00:28:15.358 --> 00:28:16.499
You are a tiger.

00:28:16.579 --> 00:28:17.342
No. No. No.

00:28:17.422 --> 00:28:17.989
Okay, look.

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:25.505
Let me introduce you
to your uncle and aunt.

00:28:29.017 --> 00:28:29.883
Look.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.852
This is uncle.

00:28:31.988 --> 00:28:32.902
Don't call me that.

00:28:33.381 --> 00:28:35.219
You remember?
We met in the bathroom.

00:28:35.327 --> 00:28:36.356
The famous one.

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:38.842
This is aunt.
Aunt Chanchu.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.992
I told you, didn't I?

00:28:44.177 --> 00:28:46.273
What is this?
He started crying again on seeing you.

00:28:47.238 --> 00:28:47.833
My Cheetu!

00:28:52.062 --> 00:28:53.436
Cheetu!
Cheetu!

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:56.820
My baby. Cheetu. Cheetu.
