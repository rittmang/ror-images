WEBVTT

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.740
Cut!

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:01.949
Got it, sir.

00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:03.824
Next shot, please

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:22.407
Tell me.
Tell me.

00:01:23.324 --> 00:01:25.240
- It is fine but why are you smiling?

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.782
Chitwan's character is fun loving.

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:28.615
That's why.

00:01:28.782 --> 00:01:30.032
Yes. How did you decide that?

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:32.949
I read the book.
It's written in the book.

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:35.740
That's the problem with
the Indian education system.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:37.407
We believe everything
we read in the book..

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:40.949
..but here we need practicality
and realism more, you know.

00:01:41.032 --> 00:01:42.157
So, I would just..

00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:45.115
But this is a true story.
- Yeah.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:46.740
Where is Baba?

00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:48.615
Baba told me about Chitwan.
Baba.

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.907
You're right.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.490
It's a true story..

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:54.449
..but the fact is,
Chitwan is back from jail.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:57.282
I mean he's a criminal.

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.949
And he's unable to pay the car loan.
That's why he's fleeing.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.282
You read the script, didn't you?

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:03.865
No, no.

00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:04.407
Yes.

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.449
His brother thinks he's an idiot.

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:08.407
His sister hasn't spoken to him in years..

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.115
and with all this baggage
I don't understand why he would smile.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.365
In fact, I'm thinking
you should channel that..

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.990
..and if doing this performance
makes you angry, then break this.

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.949
During the performance, break this.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.449
Yes, yes.

00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:20.990
It will be done.
We'll do it.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.532
We will do it.

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:22.115
Yes?
- Yes.

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:26.574
If you need help to process
it I'll lock you up in a dark room.

00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:27.407
Take a week.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.699
I have 2 or 3 such dark rooms.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.449
I shall check the occupancy.

00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:31.574
Think about it.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.407
Because I tried it with Nawaz.

00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:35.157
No, let's do it quickly.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.740
It will be done.
It will be done.

00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:36.865
Sure, right?
- Yes, in fact I'll sit in ?

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.032
for 10-15 minutes.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:39.699
I'll sit in the shade.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:40.699
That will do it.

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:41.324
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:42.365
Sure?
- We'll do it quickly.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.240
Nawaz..

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:46.449
Peter, give me the script.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.407
Darken the make-up.

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:51.490
It will be done, sir.
We'll do it quickly.

00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:56.949
Film making is like
one giant Chinese whisper.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.657
Everyone has a different
film going on in their heads.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.240
What had happened?

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.157
What I wrote?

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:05.699
What we should make.

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:08.074
It's a chaos.

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:12.490
Sir, if you don't mind,
would you please autograph my copy?

00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:13.949
Yeah.
Sure.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.615
Your name?
- Paulomi.

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:18.740
But my friends call me Paula.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:19.699
Yeah.

00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:22.449
Paulomi.
- Yes.

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:25.532
Sir, just like you
my uncle's son is a wimp.

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:27.490
Even he is terrified of the dark.

00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:30.240
The character of the older
brother is you, isn't it?

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.949
Yes.

00:03:32.532 --> 00:03:34.115
Losely.
- Obviously.

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:36.490
The Marco Polo chapter was totally unreal.

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.865
That doesn't happen.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.240
Yes, but that..
- But it was really funny.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:41.449
Exactly.
- Thank you so much.

00:03:41.532 --> 00:03:42.115
Baba.
Baba.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.074
We should be leaving now.
We have the store opening.

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:47.199
It is the wedding season
and Delhi's traffic can be bad.

00:03:47.282 --> 00:03:48.615
I'll go say bye.

00:03:51.407 --> 00:03:53.074
His bye will take hours.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.990
Set up the master over here
if you wish but don't make it too wide..

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.490
..because the Qutab Minar
will be visible at the back..

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:00.157
..and the metro is visible here.

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.407
We'll need to adjust it a bit.
Okay, bro.

00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:03.824
I'm off.
- Yes.

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:04.240
Good.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.824
In any case you are creating
some problems over here.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.532
Sorry?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.560
You

00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:13.407
Why are you talking to Jeetu?

00:04:13.657 --> 00:04:15.615
I mean, why are you telling
him about the real Chitwan?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.199
I mean, now he's thinking Chitwan's
like this fun loving character.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.699
But Chitwan is a fun loving guy.

00:04:19.782 --> 00:04:22.240
Yes, but that is not my interpretation.
You're confusing the actor.

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:23.740
Look, you wrote the book.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.115
Forget about it now.

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:26.699
Let me do my work now.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:29.157
In any case we have
plenty of problems here.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.699
Such as, I wanted to shoot in Rajasthan..

00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:32.157
..but political problems came up.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.657
That's why I'm adjusting
here on the roof of Chhatarpur.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:36.615
I am creating Jodhpur.
No, no, I was just..

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.449
I mean, let's just don't
do this to each other.

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:39.407
I mean, let's work together..

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.240
..but we can work together
without working together at all.

00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:42.407
I mean, that's the best way.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.032
I think you'll see that that works.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.657
Well, take care.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.574
I'm doing a wide shot.
Stay out of it.

00:04:45.657 --> 00:04:46.490
You'll come in the field here.

00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:51.490
Yes.
This..

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:52.449
Show me the move.

00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:55.990
Never mind the dance.
Do you have a dark story?

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.907
Do you have an elderly sibling at home?

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:03.824
Have you ever been to jail?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.449
Okay, bro.

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:07.199
I'm off.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.865
Baba, you're beautiful.

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:17.240
- Thanks.
But ugly inside.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:19.740
Just like me.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:24.699
See you.

00:06:17.282 --> 00:06:18.574
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.824
Excuse me, sir. Can I have a selfie?

00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:31.157
What did your siblings think of the book?

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:33.324
I don't know.

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.532
I'm not sure if they've read it.

00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:37.824
They're all busy in their lives.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.782
I hope they have read it and liked it.

00:06:40.074 --> 00:06:42.365
So, you don't meet?
- No. We do meet.

00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:43.907
Just recently we haven't met for a while.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.865
I was busy on the book tour.

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.907
My parents are on vacation.
On a cruise.

00:06:48.532 --> 00:06:50.907
So, we shall meet soon.
We'll plan a reunion

00:06:51.324 --> 00:06:53.532
And where are you planning this reunion?

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.449
I haven't decided the location and menu.

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:58.907
Where we'll meet and what we'll eat.

00:06:59.657 --> 00:07:01.115
We shall see how it goes.

00:07:27.282 --> 00:07:27.949
Baba!

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.615
Chitwan?
- How are you, Baba?

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.657
What are you doing?
- Sorry. Sorry.

00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:34.324
I am excited about seeing you.

00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:36.324
I called you so many times.

00:07:36.574 --> 00:07:37.740
Why aren't you answering my calls?

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:41.074
My phone number is changed.
- If your number is changed..

00:07:41.157 --> 00:07:42.615
..you should inform me, shouldn't you?

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.074
Whose child is this?
- Mine.

00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:49.032
What do you mean, "Yours?
" - I mean he is mine.

00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:51.824
When did that happen?
- It's been 6-8 months.

00:07:52.157 --> 00:07:53.907
We met six months ago.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:58.365
Everything happened so quickly
I didn't have the time to tell, Baba.

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:00.615
How can you have such a big child quickly?

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.490
Hello.
Hello.

00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:03.657
Hello, uncle.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:10.782
You are into a scam again, aren't you?

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:11.907
Whose child is that?

00:08:12.157 --> 00:08:14.782
I told you he's mine, Baba.
- How can he be your child?

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:16.157
You don't even resemble each other.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.949
Not even a semblance.
- Baba.

00:08:18.157 --> 00:08:19.657
Don't put doubts in my child's head.

00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:21.907
I am your papa, okay.

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:24.199
Are you a moron?
Going around with a kidnapped child.

00:08:24.615 --> 00:08:25.699
Why are you swearing?

00:08:25.782 --> 00:08:28.615
Children are influenced at this age.
- Sorry.

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:31.074
Sir, can I take a selfie?
- I am talking to the child.

00:08:31.407 --> 00:08:32.407
One selfie, sir.
One selfie.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.240
Okay. Come. Come.

00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:34.115
Let's go.

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:36.199
Thank you, sir.

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:36.824
Thank you.

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:37.865
You see, Cheetah.

00:08:38.115 --> 00:08:40.157
Your uncle is very famous.

00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:42.324
What is Cheetah?
- Cheetah.

00:08:42.657 --> 00:08:43.824
Cheetah Sharma.

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:46.740
He is the fastest Sharma of us all.

00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:49.990
You named him Cheetah?
- Yes.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:52.949
Hello.

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:54.240
Brother Hari.

00:08:54.824 --> 00:08:55.240
Listen.

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:57.657
You must cancel all my
appointments this evening.

00:08:59.115 --> 00:09:01.365
It's a family emergency.

00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:03.199
My brother had a baby.

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:06.907
No, the baby isn't born now.
The baby was born earlier..

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:08.365
..but I am seeing him now.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.157
I'll tell you the whole
story when I see you later.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.115
Cancel all my appointments this evening.

00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:13.949
Yes.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.490
Come with me.
- Why, Baba?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.490
You are dominating me already.

00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:20.490
I have to go home.

00:09:21.074 --> 00:09:23.407
I have responsibilities.
- Sorry, bro.

00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:24.949
I didn't mean to dominate.

00:09:25.407 --> 00:09:27.157
May I come to your house with you?

00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:32.407
You may come but..
- What? Any problem?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.657
I'll have to take permission.

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:37.324
Whose?

00:09:56.407 --> 00:09:57.532
Careful.

00:10:02.824 --> 00:10:04.574
He starts crying the
moment he's away from me.

00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:06.490
Don't worry, Cheetah.
I'm coming.

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:07.657
Come on, Baba.

00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:10.157
This is your house?
- Yes.

00:10:10.407 --> 00:10:11.657
Why are you so shocked?

00:10:12.407 --> 00:10:13.407
It is normal.
Come.

00:10:13.907 --> 00:10:16.282
This is normal?
- Don't act like a middle class person.

00:11:05.907 --> 00:11:09.240
Chitwan is calling some
senior lawyer's home his.

00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:11.990
It's damn weird.

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:15.032
The weirdest thing in
this house is this painting.

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.115
I don't think it's a painting.

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:18.115
I think it's a..

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:19.949
It's a flag..

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:22.907
of China.

00:11:24.157 --> 00:11:28.699
It's this red thing with a white spot.

00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:31.115
It isn't even made using a compass.

00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:33.365
It appears to be freehand.

00:11:33.782 --> 00:11:34.949
So moving, no?

00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:44.699
Always makes me cry.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.949
Come, bro.
Let's eat.

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:10.032
Baba.

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:21.115
No.

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.324
No.

00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:34.824
Hi.

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:36.407
No.

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:39.532
Hello.

00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:42.699
Baba, meet my girlfriend.

00:12:43.574 --> 00:12:44.490
Sorry.

00:12:44.907 --> 00:12:46.324
My partner.
Sheetal.

00:12:47.574 --> 00:12:49.282
That's Baba.

00:12:50.157 --> 00:12:51.490
Isn't he beautiful?

00:12:52.782 --> 00:12:53.699
Hi.

00:12:54.157 --> 00:12:55.032
Finally.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.449
It's been 3-4 times.

00:12:58.699 --> 00:12:59.699
Hello, Chandar.

00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:02.032
Chitwan talks about you a lot.

00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:05.949
I hope good things.
- Mostly.

00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:09.407
But unfortunately he's
never said anything about you.

00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:12.782
In fact for the past 6 months
he didn't deem it necessary to talk to me.

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:15.657
That's how he rolls, I guess.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.907
Dinner?
- That's just what I was about to say.

00:13:26.032 --> 00:13:27.115
You see the connection?

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.199
Baba, sit here.
- Please.

00:13:28.282 --> 00:13:29.407
Here. Here.

00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:39.782
I hope you don't mind.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.240
All of us are vegan.

00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:45.115
That means we don't eat any eggs,
chicken or meat, Baba.

00:13:45.865 --> 00:13:46.782
We don't even drink milk.

00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:49.907
I hope the child drinks milk.
- Yes, yes.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.032
Cheetah does.

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:54.532
Can you please stop calling him that?
- It's a nice name, baby.

00:13:54.657 --> 00:13:55.615
Even he likes it.

00:13:55.865 --> 00:13:57.157
Cheetah Sharma. Right, Baba?

00:13:57.907 --> 00:14:03.240
Chaitanya Gujral.
- Yeah, that's also nice.

00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:06.240
So, Sheetal, you're a lawyer, right?
- Yes

00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:07.365
You must be a top lawyer.

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.907
I mean the house is quite lavish.

00:14:14.074 --> 00:14:15.240
All of this belongs to my father.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.699
I was born wealthy.

00:14:17.074 --> 00:14:18.574
So, I was really never interested in it.

00:14:19.282 --> 00:14:22.365
I'm a human rights lawyer
and primarily an activist.

00:14:23.074 --> 00:14:25.574
Meaning?
- I like raising questions.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.699
I don't like conceding with people.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:30.949
You mean, petitions,
strikes and marches, twitter, all that?

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.199
Just about anything.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.449
Anything that can bring
about a change in a jaded mindset.

00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:39.365
But you do fight cases, right?
You go to the court and..?

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:45.199
I only take cases that mean something.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.865
When someone makes fun
of the North Eastern people..

00:14:47.907 --> 00:14:51.115
..or when people thing
homosexuality is an illness..

00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:54.949
..I raise my voice for them.
- She's amazing!

00:14:56.115 --> 00:14:59.824
Incidentally, how was your event?
- Good.

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:03.615
There was a controversy recently, right?

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.324
Your book was banned.
- No.

00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:07.907
The book wasn't banned.
The film shoot was stopped.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:10.074
They're making a film on my book.

00:15:10.865 --> 00:15:13.490
There is a little stress
on the sexuality of a character.

00:15:14.282 --> 00:15:15.699
Can you turn down the music a little bit?

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.657
Isn't it a little loud?

00:15:21.782 --> 00:15:23.699
It's fine, actually.
Sorry.

00:15:24.074 --> 00:15:24.782
It's quite nice.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.199
Classical.
- Yeah.

00:15:27.115 --> 00:15:28.949
Anyways, how is your music going?

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.074
Isn't he a great DJ?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.699
Baba, that..

00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:40.699
Will you have meat?

00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:42.824
Yeah. Sure.

00:15:44.074 --> 00:15:49.657
Although we don't eat but if
you like I'll send Govind out to get some.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:50.365
No. No. No.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.740
Don't trouble Govind.

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:53.699
I'm fine.
- Alright, then.

00:15:54.157 --> 00:15:55.782
I'll leave you two gentlemen to it.

00:15:56.907 --> 00:15:59.324
I have to file a petition tomorrow, so..

00:16:00.407 --> 00:16:01.407
I'll see you at breakfast.

00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:03.949
Actually I have to go back to my Hotel.

00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:04.949
I have a booking.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.990
The guestroom is ready for you,
but then it's up to you.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.824
Good night.
- Goodnight, baby.

00:16:18.824 --> 00:16:20.699
She's very sweet, isn't she?

00:16:22.824 --> 00:16:23.699
Very sweet.

00:16:27.032 --> 00:16:29.199
Is smoking allowed in this pincode ?

00:16:33.907 --> 00:16:36.907
What were you doing when
I asked you about music?

00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:40.740
Did you stop?
- Baba, I stopped playing in clubs.

00:16:41.074 --> 00:16:42.699
I play mostly at private functions now.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.657
Weddings, ladies music,
vigils and prayer meets.

00:16:46.782 --> 00:16:48.115
Mostly spiritual stuff.

00:16:48.365 --> 00:16:49.990
I have to look after
Cheetah the rest of the time.

00:16:50.282 --> 00:16:51.449
I have to tend to the house.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.365
The servants come early morning.
A head count is taken.

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:54.782
Attendance, you know.
All that.

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.449
So I'm like the house-husband.

00:16:57.365 --> 00:16:59.199
Did you marry her?
- No. No.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.282
But I will.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.032
I am saving up money for a ring.

00:17:03.824 --> 00:17:04.490
A ring..?

00:17:06.907 --> 00:17:07.782
Yes, brother Hari.

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:09.490
Baba, I'm sorry for disturbing you.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.324
The Jaipur Literature fest tomorrow
can't be cancelled.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:17.532
Because your tickets have been booked.
Your face is put up on the hoardings.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.157
Okay, I'll come in the morning.
We will go together.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.449
Ok Baba.

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:23.365
Listen.

00:17:23.907 --> 00:17:26.365
At the Jaipur literature fair, we..

00:17:27.574 --> 00:17:30.240
Please stop the music.
Where is the remote?

00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:31.157
She's gone now.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.907
Okay. One second.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.657
Maestro, take a short break.
Baba can't handle it.

00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:43.907
Ok.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.949
These people come here and play live?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:48.115 --> 00:17:49.074
She likes it live.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.615
If you have a request, let them know.

00:17:50.699 --> 00:17:51.699
They will play it.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.865
No, no.

00:17:53.074 --> 00:17:54.865
I don't have any request.
Please go.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.407
Sure?
- Yes, yes.

00:17:56.657 --> 00:17:58.407
You go and rest.

00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:06.240
What about their human rights?

00:18:06.532 --> 00:18:08.657
Didn't she say..

00:18:08.907 --> 00:18:10.490
Just a minute.

00:18:10.782 --> 00:18:13.365
Baba, I'm sorry.
My son needs me.

00:18:13.907 --> 00:18:15.490
Good night.
- Listen. Listen.

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:17.032
I am going to Jaipur tomorrow.

00:18:17.282 --> 00:18:18.490
It's a 3-4 hour drive.

00:18:18.907 --> 00:18:19.907
Let's go together.

00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:22.782
We'll chat on the way.
We will bond.

00:18:23.407 --> 00:18:24.865
Baba, don't tempt me.

00:18:25.115 --> 00:18:26.949
You know road trips are my weakness.

00:18:27.032 --> 00:18:30.324
So, come.
- I have lots to do.

00:18:30.824 --> 00:18:31.574
The gardener is going to come tomorrow

00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:32.282
I have to get the whole lawn trimmed.

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.115
From here to there.

00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:34.490
There is an even bigger lawn at the back.

00:18:34.615 --> 00:18:36.074
There the grass has
grown right up to the chest.

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:38.449
Why are you acting pricey?

00:18:38.532 --> 00:18:39.907
If papa had told you,
you would have agreed.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.782
You should listen to
your brother sometimes.

00:18:42.282 --> 00:18:43.240
Just you and me.

00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:44.990
I missed you, man.

00:18:45.907 --> 00:18:47.449
That was an emotional pitch.

00:18:48.449 --> 00:18:50.282
The last time we took
a road trip under duress.

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:52.949
This time we will bond.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:55.157
Wow!

00:18:55.324 --> 00:18:57.990
I don't understand
your new casual attitude..

00:18:58.574 --> 00:19:00.324
..but anyway, I'm off this crap, Baba.

00:19:00.949 --> 00:19:04.115
Are you coming or not?
- I told you I you I have lots to do.

00:19:04.282 --> 00:19:05.782
I have to feed Cheetah.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.574
I'll ask Sheetal about tomorrow.
- Do what you want.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.574
Give me a missed call.

00:19:11.657 --> 00:19:12.907
What are you doing?

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.240
He is waiting for me.

00:19:14.907 --> 00:19:16.157
The new number..

00:19:16.907 --> 00:19:18.115
I'll send you the number.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.115
Brother.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.782
Sorry.

00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:34.115
You may continue with your program.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.657
I only came for a short while.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.740
Madam, I ate one kitkat
from the mini bar in my room..

00:19:48.032 --> 00:19:51.115
..and I bought the same kitkat
for rupees 20 from the market..

00:19:51.199 --> 00:19:52.782
..to replace it in the mini bar.

00:19:53.407 --> 00:19:58.199
When I opened the mini bar I noticed
your staff had already replaced it..

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.199
..and you have billed..

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.240
I drew the entire family
tree and showed it to your Director.

00:20:02.324 --> 00:20:03.532
There is no aunt in my script.

00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:05.865
You can cast her if you want.

00:20:06.907 --> 00:20:08.740
How can she be blond?
We are Indians.

00:20:09.657 --> 00:20:10.407
Yes, yes.

00:20:12.074 --> 00:20:13.074
Yes. Kimi Katkar..

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.157
Cast anyone you want.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.365
Okay, bye.

00:20:21.907 --> 00:20:25.240
You got permission.
- Of course, Baba!

00:20:25.782 --> 00:20:26.949
I was bound to get permission.

00:20:27.324 --> 00:20:28.699
Sheetal is very sweet.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.657
She was a little upset because
you didn't stay last night.

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:33.907
Still she let me come with you.

00:20:34.782 --> 00:20:36.532
But she didn't let Cheetah come.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.782
I'll miss him.

00:20:38.157 --> 00:20:39.157
You'll see him soon.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.949
Do you ever miss me?

00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:44.199
Baba, what is this
emotional crap you're doing?

00:20:44.782 --> 00:20:46.032
I'm loving it!

00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:54.824
Whose car is this?

00:20:55.115 --> 00:20:56.240
What do you mean?

00:20:56.532 --> 00:20:57.449
I mean the last time you were fleeing..

00:20:57.615 --> 00:20:59.574
..with a car without paying the loan.

00:20:59.907 --> 00:21:01.490
Have you started a new business this time?

00:21:01.782 --> 00:21:03.074
Business?

00:21:03.324 --> 00:21:04.782
Baba, you're a respectable author now.

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:06.032
You should work on your language.

00:21:06.824 --> 00:21:08.407
I rented the car from drivezy.

00:21:08.657 --> 00:21:09.074
Really?

00:21:09.324 --> 00:21:10.699
They have started in India as well?

00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:11.865
Of course, Baba.

00:21:11.907 --> 00:21:14.740
You took a trip or two abroad..
..and you are underestimating India.

00:21:14.824 --> 00:21:17.157
I am asking you if you
paid the EMI for the last car..

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.449
..or did you leave it on the road?

00:21:19.032 --> 00:21:20.449
I wondered about that.

00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:22.449
How can you change?

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.074
You're just the same, Baba.

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:25.907
You still fry my head asking questions.

00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:27.782
I missed you.

00:21:28.324 --> 00:21:29.449
Get in.
I'll tell you in the car.

00:21:30.032 --> 00:21:31.824
What have you thought about me?

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.740
Brother Hari, follow us in the other car.
- Oh, thank you.

00:21:34.824 --> 00:21:35.824
This is brother Hari.

00:21:36.949 --> 00:21:37.907
Hurry brother.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.949
Yes! Road trip.

00:22:20.615 --> 00:22:22.532
Chitwan, tell me without getting offended.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.157
Is Cheetah your child?

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.282
He is Sheetal's.

00:22:29.574 --> 00:22:31.532
Actually her ex-husband was rude to her..

00:22:31.865 --> 00:22:33.074
..while she was pregnant.

00:22:33.324 --> 00:22:34.532
So, she divorced him.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.115
Then Cheetah was born.

00:22:36.365 --> 00:22:38.532
And then I came on the scene.
Now we're one happy family.

00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:44.824
Where did you meet Sheetal?

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:47.782
What do you mean?

00:22:48.115 --> 00:22:49.365
I'm not asking without reason.

00:22:49.449 --> 00:22:51.782
Both your circles appear very different.

00:22:53.949 --> 00:22:57.282
It's a long story.
- We have time.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.574
Listen.

00:22:59.699 --> 00:23:02.199
I was playing at a very
big party in Chhatarpur.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.490
It was crazy!

00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:08.949
Everyone was enjoying.
They were dancing.

00:23:09.282 --> 00:23:12.282
And I too was enjoying
looking at everyone.

00:23:12.407 --> 00:23:13.740
It was a great night!

00:23:13.824 --> 00:23:14.907
Then the Police raided the place.

00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:16.949
It was an LGBT party.
A controversy took place.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.490
Drugs were seized.

00:23:18.657 --> 00:23:20.574
Nab them!
- Me too.

00:23:20.782 --> 00:23:22.449
You were high again?
- Baba, I was clean but they

00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:23.865
wouldn't believe me.

00:23:24.199 --> 00:23:25.199
You want me to urinate to prove to you?

00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:27.490
Test my urine, sir.

00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:30.949
They wouldn't let me urinate,
much less test it.

00:23:31.324 --> 00:23:33.949
This time I would have gone
to jail for long.

00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:38.407
But then Sheetal made an entry.

00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:42.949
Baba, light, music and everything
changed within me.

00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:45.699
And in that moment I realized

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.532
Baba, you aren't the only one
who is beautiful.

00:23:52.782 --> 00:23:56.657
That's it. Fell in love during questioning
And commitment during action.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.907
Sheetal said, if I can clean up my act
it will prove that my love is true.

00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:05.990
Then, Sheetal and Cheetah
will be my family.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.615
And your family too.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.615
A probation period is going on now,
so, let's see.

00:24:17.532 --> 00:24:19.032
You went to jail again?

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.407
Yup.

00:24:20.907 --> 00:24:22.782
That's why I couldn't
come to your book launch.

00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:26.740
Don't make it a habit to go to jail.

00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:28.949
Baba, I feel pretty comfortable there.

00:24:29.365 --> 00:24:31.657
Even the menu is made as per my taste now.

00:24:37.615 --> 00:24:40.532
Chitwan's jail story is
a great idea for a sub plot.

00:24:42.199 --> 00:24:43.240
What is that, bro?
What are you doing?

00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:46.199
Preparing for my next book.
- I am in that as well?

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.740
Maybe.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.324
Repeat your jail story from the start.
- Okay.

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:54.824
Which one?

00:24:56.032 --> 00:24:57.074
How many times have you gone to jail?

00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:03.782
No, no.
That was a party in jail.

00:25:19.532 --> 00:25:21.490
If you continue with
this casual attitude..

00:25:21.949 --> 00:25:23.407
..people will stop giving you work.

00:25:24.324 --> 00:25:25.490
You will land up on the street.

00:25:27.074 --> 00:25:28.449
We are on the street, Baba.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.449
I am talking about earning money,
you moron!

00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:33.907
That is narrow thinking, Baba.

00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:35.949
Baba, it's 2019..

00:25:36.324 --> 00:25:40.740
..and there are 2019 ways
to earn money in this day and age.

00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:43.907
Such as?
- Such as..

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.615
..sperm donation.

00:25:45.907 --> 00:25:47.907
And my sperm is..!
- Gross!

00:25:48.407 --> 00:25:49.949
Vicky donor is a movie.

00:25:50.407 --> 00:25:52.907
In real life you don't get
paid that much for sperm donation.

00:25:53.199 --> 00:25:54.532
Else all the horny people in the world..

00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:56.699
..and all the truck drivers
would be millionaires now.

00:25:57.324 --> 00:25:58.740
Oh, yeah!

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.949
But there is the vigil market.
It is very strong in India.

00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:05.282
Chitwan, vigils are seasonal.

00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:08.282
You cannot perform at the
Goddess' vigil during Halloween.

00:26:13.032 --> 00:26:14.074
Okay.

00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:17.740
Okay, what?
- I mean okay

00:26:18.657 --> 00:26:20.240
There is no season for road trips,
is there?

00:26:20.824 --> 00:26:23.865
Baba, I put my car on drivezy ?

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:25.199
to earn money..

00:26:25.657 --> 00:26:27.824
..and when I need it I rent it.

00:26:28.324 --> 00:26:29.907
I have no stress about maintenance..

00:26:30.615 --> 00:26:32.115
..and these are times of sharing, Baba.

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:33.782
This is a Bombay number.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.407
You brought the car from Bombay?

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.032
I went to Bombay two days ago.

00:26:37.574 --> 00:26:39.407
I went on the highway at
night to get some mouth freshener..

00:26:39.657 --> 00:26:40.907
..and I wound up in Delhi.

00:26:41.657 --> 00:26:44.157
Do you know I arrived
before the Rajdhani train?

00:26:45.157 --> 00:26:47.365
You came from Bombay
to Delhi before the Rajdhani?

00:26:47.574 --> 00:26:49.449
Yes. How?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.574
Sit on the sideboard and I'll tell you.

00:26:53.824 --> 00:26:54.740
You sit.
I'll drive.

00:26:54.907 --> 00:26:56.074
Why are you afraid?

00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:57.615
Try me.
It is a rented car.

00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.487
Don't brag.
I'll drive at Jan Shatabdi's speed

00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:34.449
I would like to call upon the stage
to speak about his latest book 'Zoo'..

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.032
..Mr.
Richard Garrison.

00:27:42.074 --> 00:27:43.449
Kids.

00:27:43.907 --> 00:27:45.449
I love kids.

00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:48.032
Do you have kids?
- Yes.

00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:50.324
One girl and two jackasses.

00:27:51.907 --> 00:27:53.574
One should not have two boys.

00:27:57.699 --> 00:27:59.115
Incidentally, we haven't been introduced.

00:28:00.157 --> 00:28:03.532
Myself, Hari Kishor Shukla.
- Hi. I'm Chitwan.

00:28:04.074 --> 00:28:05.949
The hero of Baba's book.
- I know. I know.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.340
..enjoy reading it as much
as I've enjoyed writing it.

00:28:10.548 --> 00:28:11.590
Thank you, folks.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.923
Thank you very much.

00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:16.340
Thank you, Richard.

00:28:17.173 --> 00:28:18.840
And now for our next speaker.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.006
Yes, the one whom you
all have been waiting for.

00:28:22.548 --> 00:28:26.423
Has shot to overnight fame
and has truly become a sensation.

00:28:27.256 --> 00:28:29.548
I guess it helps that he is so handsome.

00:28:30.298 --> 00:28:33.340
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please put your hands together..

00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:37.215
..for the author of Tripling, Mr.
Chandan Sharma.

00:28:40.465 --> 00:28:41.256
Baba!

00:28:42.048 --> 00:28:43.923
Chandan, before I handover
the stage to you..

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.756
..there's something that
I would like to tell you.

00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:48.673
Baba, you are beautiful!

00:28:50.423 --> 00:28:51.340
That's my line.

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:53.588
Big fan of your book sir.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.297
So, how do you deal with
all the female attention?

00:28:59.797 --> 00:29:02.338
Well, experience has thought
me not to always trust it.

00:29:11.547 --> 00:29:12.005
Crap!

00:29:12.797 --> 00:29:14.047
Baba gets scared of the dark.

00:29:15.213 --> 00:29:15.588
What..?

00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:16.672
What are you doing?
- Let's go!

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.505
Bring him!
- Security.

00:29:19.047 --> 00:29:20.255
Chitwan.
- Baba.

00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:23.505
What the hell!

00:29:24.838 --> 00:29:25.630
Hurry up!

00:29:26.422 --> 00:29:27.005
Put the gun down.

00:29:27.088 --> 00:29:29.547
Brother, I am cooperating.
- Let's go!

00:29:29.838 --> 00:29:30.380
Baba.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.380
Baba.

00:29:32.672 --> 00:29:34.880
Baba, is the controversy
on your book so big?

00:29:35.213 --> 00:29:36.755
What have you written?
- Silence!

00:29:37.588 --> 00:29:38.338
Keep your mouth shut!

00:29:38.547 --> 00:29:39.838
You get in the car as well.
- No, sir.

00:29:39.922 --> 00:29:41.380
My car is here.
I'll come in it.

00:29:41.797 --> 00:29:43.505
We will bring it!
- One moment.

00:29:43.588 --> 00:29:44.922
Let go.
What are you doing?

00:29:45.213 --> 00:29:46.463
You are kidnapping me?

00:29:46.672 --> 00:29:48.005
Do you know who I am?
- Baba.

00:29:48.172 --> 00:29:49.672
Why are you talking like a Delhite?

00:29:50.615 --> 00:29:51.505
Listen, Homies.

00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:52.880
What do you want?

00:29:53.213 --> 00:29:53.880
You want money?

00:29:54.422 --> 00:29:56.005
My fiancée has lots of money.

00:29:56.088 --> 00:29:58.755
We don't want any money!
- Everybody has seen you in there, sir.

00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:00.797
You will get trapped,
but don't stress over it.

00:30:01.255 --> 00:30:02.505
She will fight your case.

00:30:02.963 --> 00:30:05.713
And if anyone is a handicap or ill,
then you will benefit even more.

00:30:06.588 --> 00:30:07.797
Mental disabilities.

00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:55.797
Damn!

00:30:58.922 --> 00:30:59.630
Chitwan.

00:30:59.922 --> 00:31:00.797
Chitwan.

00:31:02.005 --> 00:31:02.755
Get up.

00:31:03.047 --> 00:31:03.797
Up.

00:31:10.922 --> 00:31:12.130
This is a very strange dream.

00:31:13.255 --> 00:31:14.922
I am sitting on a giant wheel with Baba.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.297
It must be a childhood connection.

00:31:18.922 --> 00:31:20.297
I won't even remember it by morning.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:21.922
Chitwan!

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.047
This is not a dream.
It is reality.

00:31:24.172 --> 00:31:26.797
We've been kidnapped and
put up here on the giant wheel.

00:31:27.213 --> 00:31:28.547
Hey!
- Really?

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:31.213
Wow!
What a situation!

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.213
Remove your recorder,
Baba, and make notes.

00:31:33.547 --> 00:31:35.005
Write a thriller for your next book.

00:31:35.338 --> 00:31:37.297
What are you saying?
I will push you.

00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:39.588
You're talking nonsense!
We have been kidnapped.

00:31:41.047 --> 00:31:43.588
Man!
- It's okay

00:31:45.088 --> 00:31:46.088
Hey!

00:31:46.797 --> 00:31:47.588
Brother.

00:31:47.838 --> 00:31:49.422
Stop this giant wheel.
- Please stop it

00:31:49.547 --> 00:31:50.255
Man!

00:32:19.172 --> 00:32:20.505
All of them are watching the dance.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.463
Don't watch the dance.
Let us get off.

00:32:23.588 --> 00:32:24.130
Baba.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.255
Round.
- What round?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.297
Round and round.
- We don't have any personal differences.

00:32:31.047 --> 00:32:31.963
Stop the giant wheel!

00:32:32.088 --> 00:32:33.463
What kind of torture is this, brother?

00:32:33.713 --> 00:32:35.255
Really? Go and call
your dad from there.

00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:37.130
Tell him we are stuck over here.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.297
What are you doing?

00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:40.672
Is this some kind of joke?

00:32:41.005 --> 00:32:41.672
Brother.

00:33:18.088 --> 00:33:19.380
Fancy cars.

00:33:19.547 --> 00:33:21.130
Who has come in the car?

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.338
Chanchal?

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.255
Chanchal!

00:33:39.505 --> 00:33:40.130
Hey, Chanchal.

00:33:40.213 --> 00:33:40.797
Chanchu.

00:33:40.838 --> 00:33:41.922
Tell them to stop the giant wheel.

00:33:42.005 --> 00:33:43.088
How did Chanchal come here?

00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:44.880
Hey, Chanchal.

00:33:45.338 --> 00:33:45.713
Chanchal.

00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:47.005
Tell them to stop the giant wheel.

00:33:50.838 --> 00:33:51.630
Chanchu.

00:33:53.422 --> 00:33:54.005
Chanchu.

00:33:54.338 --> 00:33:55.005
Chanchal.

00:33:57.088 --> 00:33:59.380
Tell them to stop the giant wheel.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.172
Come on the giant wheel, Chanchu.
We'll have a reunion.

00:34:03.255 --> 00:34:04.172
Are you crazy?

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.503
Chanchal?

00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.005
What's the matter?

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.130
What are you doing?

00:34:11.338 --> 00:34:13.380
Chanchal!
- Was that for me or for you, brother?

00:34:15.755 --> 00:34:17.755
Is she upset with me?

00:34:18.005 --> 00:34:18.547
Stop!

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.797
I am feeling dizzy.

00:34:20.172 --> 00:34:23.088
I am enjoying myself, Baba.

00:34:23.713 --> 00:34:25.505
In fact, I'm feeling a little high.

00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:27.630
And for a change, it's legal.

00:34:27.838 --> 00:34:30.172
I love this sensation.
- Stop!

00:34:31.838 --> 00:34:32.172
You fool!

00:34:32.255 --> 00:34:33.630
This is not a sensation.
It's a concussion.

00:34:33.922 --> 00:34:34.922
We are hurt in the head.

00:34:35.422 --> 00:34:37.755
You don't know how to enjoy.

00:34:38.172 --> 00:34:39.922
Thanks for the ride, Chanchal.
