WEBVTT

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.714
What is this 'Amma's place'?

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:25.642
It's completely changed in 2 years.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.226
I'm talking to you.

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:35.655
Did you know as well?

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:39.291
You're here?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.123
You knew, right?

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:44.862
What?

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:47.790
That she was faking
the pregnancy.

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.954
So embarrassing, man.

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:56.612
Now what will I say to my family.

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:59.443
They are celebrating it
there like crazy...

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.760
One minute, why are so stressed?

00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:03.911
What will you say to your family?

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:05.502
Or what will you answer to your people?

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:06.793
The celebrations will get canceled?

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:08.149
This is what you're concerned about?

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.697
You aren't concerned
about where Chanchal

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:12.231
and your relationship is heading?

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:14.177
I came here to fix that, man!

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:16.435
And here I hear about,

00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:17.423
the fake pregnancy thing.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.243
She shouldn’t have lied.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.341
You also lied, right?

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:28.750
All this royalty bullshit,
combing your mustache etc.

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:30.044
This is all a lie, right?

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:31.899
Are you allowed to lie?

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.671
What's the current situation?

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.539
The fight is on.

00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:50.063
I thought that,

00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:52.079
since she lied,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.648
I'll have an upper hand but

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.490
she's playing on the front foot.

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:00.156
Did you see my mom and dad?

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.832
Haven't seen mom,

00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:02.998
but dad is inside.

00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:03.974
I'll just...

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:04.999
Yeah.

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:12.880
Welcome, son.

00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:14.458
How are you, divorcee?

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.110
Dad?

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:20.995
Arey, have a sense of humour, son.

00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.574
Yeah

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:23.090
What are you doing?

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:23.852
Come here.

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:28.943
Daughter is already here and sulking.

00:03:31.737 --> 00:03:33.539
Yeah, but she isn't divorced yet.

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:35.086
She was almost there.

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:36.054
Trust me.

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:39.768
Dad, I fail to understand how

00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:41.689
easily you joke about everything.

00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:43.669
Son, I fail to understand how you

00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:45.937
manage to take
everything so seriously?

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:47.927
Anyway...

00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:50.381
Let's have some whiskey.

00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:52.958
Where's mom?

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.252
And what is Amma's place?

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.276
I'll tell you.

00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:57.181
Whiskey on the rocks?

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:59.181
Dad, it's time for tea.

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:00.689
But the mood goes with alcohol.

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:02.014
Close your nose and gulp it.

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:13.321
Oh my... I'm terribly sorry.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.463
Did you get hurt?

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:15.805
Umm, no.

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:16.904
You are?

00:04:16.968 --> 00:04:17.968
I'm Chelsea.

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:18.984
Hi.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.008
Chanchal.

00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:22.071
Oh my God! You're Charu's daughter?

00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:23.206
Hey.

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:24.389
What's up?

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.133
What is this, bro?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.066
-Beautiful, right?
-Chitvan.

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:30.448
You look like a junior artist from <i>X-men</i>.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:31.861
Chitvan.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:34.278
You're the youngest one, aren't you?

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:35.453
Yeah, sorry.

00:04:35.477 --> 00:04:36.802
That's my brother, Chitvan,

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.445
And that's Chelsea.

00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:39.778
And that is...

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:41.215
My sister.

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:42.302
Varanasi.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.452
Are these your names or your birth places?

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:46.516
Both.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:52.381
Sharon has told me
so much about you guys.

00:04:52.397 --> 00:04:54.325
I'm glad you could
make it for the game.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:57.692
Game?

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.160
Doesn't amma's place

00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:02.834
sound South Indian?

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.378
A big group of foreigners was here.

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.053
On their way from Pondicherry
and Kerala.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.616
Sayingl "amma, amma" and all.

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:12.676
They named it.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.168
Made the website,
did all the bookings etc.

00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:19.788
So you've turned the
family home into a resort?

00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:20.881
Not a resort.

00:05:22.207 --> 00:05:24.150
Foreigners call it home stay.

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:25.579
Feels like home

00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:27.019
Yeah, there have been a lot

00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.635
of offers for my haveli too.

00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:31.619
Rajasthan tourism wants it really bad...

00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:33.198
But dad, what about safety?

00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:35.155
Ask your mother the rest.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.413
Anyway it was her idea.

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:38.682
I will go and prepare
for the tournament.

00:05:39.826 --> 00:05:40.992
It's SPL finals today.

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:42.603
SPL?

00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:46.357
Something Premier League, I guess?

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:48.357
Which game begins with S?

00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:50.191
Soccer?

00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:51.881
Swimming?

00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:54.381
Sudoku?

00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:56.111
Shot put?

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.389
Squash?

00:05:59.064 --> 00:06:00.330
It could be skiing.

00:06:00.887 --> 00:06:02.904
Or PL isn't premier league!

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:03.929
And S is sponsor's.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.199
Sponsor?

00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:07.000
Sponsored Premier League?

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.103
You just talk shit.

00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:12.265
You guess, then.

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:16.213
I think it's something really simple.

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:18.602
Everybody will participate.

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:21.306
Hey!

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.186
There she is.

00:06:23.298 --> 00:06:24.456
Hey!

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:26.035
You're here finally!

00:06:30.898 --> 00:06:32.765
I heard about your escapades.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.705
Hey

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.419
Nice look, Chits.
I like it!

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.444
Thanks, mom.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:44.356
Have you guys met Varanasi and Chelsea?

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.357
Yeah.

00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:46.968
I'll introduce the rest later.

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:48.317
Let's go inside now.

00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:49.540
I have brought some mind-blowing

00:06:49.565 --> 00:06:50.754
brownies from Sangmo's bakery.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.389
One second, mom, when
did all this happen?

00:06:52.548 --> 00:06:54.754
It's been a long time.
I told you.

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.508
You didn't tell me.
Must have told him.

00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:57.277
Oh.

00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:58.992
Is there some stress
between you both?

00:06:59.143 --> 00:07:00.210
All three of us.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.176
All four.

00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:02.302
Pranav is also here.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:02.842
Oh!

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:05.104
Full family reunion.

00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:06.460
Come on,

00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:08.294
Let's prepare for the tournament.

00:07:08.342 --> 00:07:10.365
Yeah, mom, what is
this match and all?

00:07:10.382 --> 00:07:11.746
Yeah, mom, what is SPL?

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:14.167
Satoliya Pithu Laghori.

00:07:15.188 --> 00:07:17.005
It's got different names
in different places.

00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.402
So your dad named it this.

00:07:18.473 --> 00:07:19.156
Wow.

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:20.402
I would've never guessed that.

00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:22.156
Mom, these foreign chics
are gonna play Satoliya?

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:23.484
They're bloody good at it.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.650
You'll be shocked.

00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:26.428
Hey!

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.468
What's this?

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:35.008
Fine.

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:37.801
Thank goodness you're here, Charu.

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:39.977
Chandan has a lot of questions and...

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:41.643
They're carrying a lot of baggage.

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:44.420
Well emotional baggage is my forte.

00:07:44.627 --> 00:07:47.278
Hasn't it been a decade since
you were a psychologist, mom?

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.698
But I can't stop being a mom
even if I want to, right?

00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:55.276
When did you become so uptight?

00:07:55.332 --> 00:07:56.555
You aren't like either
of your parents.

00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:58.521
These aren't genetics, Charu.

00:07:58.833 --> 00:07:59.952
These are the logistics of divorce.

00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:03.278
My poor child.

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:07.970
He's so insensitive.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:09.833
Responsible.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.579
I heard a lot about you.

00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:15.849
He was constantly bitching about you
two on the phone while en route.

00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:17.881
But didn't say a word
about his exploits.

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:35.719
Maybe we should talk.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.879
Let's at least pretend that we

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:43.517
like each other while we're here.

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:44.572
That's the problem.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:45.945
I don't want to pretend.

00:08:45.954 --> 00:08:47.421
I can't do it anymore.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.645
Guys, let's just fight
and finish it off!

00:08:56.014 --> 00:08:56.974
Shut up, man!

00:09:04.584 --> 00:09:05.722
How's the brownie?

00:09:05.762 --> 00:09:06.817
Mom, I needed to...

00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.588
They're good.
They're really good.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.603
I wanted to talk to you about something...

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:13.920
Can you jut take them out

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.132
and put them on that plate.

00:09:15.157 --> 00:09:16.414
Put it in the microwave please.

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:18.278
Mom...

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:22.470
I don't know if you know but...

00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:24.390
You know
Chanchal and I...

00:09:24.422 --> 00:09:26.089
No no no. I don't know
if I want to know.

00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:28.652
Unless she is pregnant.

00:09:28.827 --> 00:09:29.827
Is she?

00:09:30.929 --> 00:09:33.753
That's what.
She said that she was.

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:34.841
But no.

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:36.175
Oh!

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.190
False alarm, huh?

00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:38.381
False?

00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:39.889
She lied to me, mom.

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:41.119
Yeah, well.

00:09:41.127 --> 00:09:42.523
That happens.

00:09:45.414 --> 00:09:47.120
In our relationship...

00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:48.985
There are some problems.

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:50.652
That also happens.

00:09:51.643 --> 00:09:52.643
I just don't...

00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:55.166
These are awesome by the way.
Just stunning.

00:09:57.024 --> 00:09:58.293
I just don't think that

00:09:58.318 --> 00:09:59.976
she is happy with me.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:02.667
Okay.

00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:05.815
She isn't happy with you

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.439
in this moment, right?

00:10:08.144 --> 00:10:10.152
And if these moments become

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:12.482
frequent then she'll leave you.

00:10:12.553 --> 00:10:14.791
Which would be the best
for everyone, right?

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:20.404
Put them in this tray.

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:21.619
No, I mean...

00:10:21.643 --> 00:10:23.976
I don't want her
to leave me, mom.

00:10:25.103 --> 00:10:26.637
Are you happy with her?

00:10:26.972 --> 00:10:27.972
Yeah, I mean...

00:10:27.987 --> 00:10:28.781
I think...

00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:30.233
I guess I'm happy.

00:10:30.495 --> 00:10:32.003
Pranav, honestly.

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:33.738
Honestly, in today's world.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.101
No one is forcing the two
of you to live together, right?

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:38.865
I know.

00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:42.174
There's tradition,
there's convention, etc.

00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:44.239
I mean people curse modernization

00:10:44.264 --> 00:10:46.222
saying nothing is sacred anymore.

00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:48.014
But you know what,

00:10:48.056 --> 00:10:49.056
I don't agree.

00:10:49.778 --> 00:10:52.056
I think now everyone

00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:54.095
has a way to get out.

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.053
And if still they are in it,

00:10:56.183 --> 00:10:56.968
then

00:10:57.111 --> 00:10:59.609
they want to be there more or less.

00:11:00.262 --> 00:11:01.262
Right?

00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:07.429
Mom, I...

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:08.713
I really love her.

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:12.182
And I want to make this work.

00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:13.921
I do.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.913
That's a good start.

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:21.899
How many did you
put in the micro?

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.550
Six, I think.

00:11:24.556 --> 00:11:27.603
I don't know, I ate like two or three.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.730
You were saying something
about you and Chanchal.

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:34.125
No, I'll sort it out.

00:11:38.527 --> 00:11:40.060
Actually, the thing is, mom

00:11:40.614 --> 00:11:43.733
These days,
I'm not really me.

00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:47.202
There's another Pranav which I think,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.776
I have to be at times.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080
And

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:52.326
Chanchal doesn't like him.

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.831
In fact even I don't like him.

00:11:56.276 --> 00:11:57.061
Who?

00:11:57.086 --> 00:11:58.831
The other Pranav.

00:12:00.294 --> 00:12:01.427
I don't like him.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.809
I don't

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:03.889
like him.

00:12:05.032 --> 00:12:06.341
But, you know, I don't know.

00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:08.412
Is that me? You know what I mean.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:09.539
You know?

00:12:09.548 --> 00:12:11.063
Is that me?

00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:11.849
That...

00:12:11.984 --> 00:12:13.262
You know, that me?

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.540
Is that me?

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:16.285
Or is this?

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:17.302
You know...

00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:19.140
Is this the me?

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.537
You know this me?

00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:23.365
You know this...

00:12:23.587 --> 00:12:24.587
This...

00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:29.484
Mom, what's in the brownies?

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:30.770
Sangmo's love.

00:12:32.024 --> 00:12:33.024
And?

00:12:33.618 --> 00:12:35.003
Just bring that tray out please.

00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:38.586
What's inside?

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:40.769
Mom.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.690
Sangmo.

00:12:52.173 --> 00:12:53.864
Well, I like both of you.

00:12:55.318 --> 00:12:56.318
Genuinely.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.539
I don't really get the issues also.

00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:01.421
What can I do?

00:13:02.103 --> 00:13:03.650
My mistakes certainly don't help.

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:06.516
But I love you guys.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.174
You hate me and my new look.

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:13.246
True.

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:17.039
Anyway,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.977
I don't have much of a
problem with you two.

00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:21.731
What if I have a problem?

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:24.810
And yes, I do have a problem
with your new look.

00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:27.440
The colour faded?

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.150
Did you put boot polish on hair?

00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:31.775
Baba, I told you na.

00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:33.500
It gets better.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.730
It's getting camouflaged
in the jungle.

00:13:35.802 --> 00:13:36.802
Hey, guys.

00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:38.301
Sorry.

00:13:38.326 --> 00:13:39.749
Is it a bad time?

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:40.789
Not at all.

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:43.159
Hi.

00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:43.857
Hi.

00:13:43.882 --> 00:13:44.865
Sorry.

00:13:44.882 --> 00:13:46.198
That's Chealsea

00:13:46.207 --> 00:13:48.540
and that's our elder brother, Chandan.

00:13:52.897 --> 00:13:53.897
Yeah.

00:13:54.794 --> 00:13:56.587
Baba, don't look at me.

00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:58.728
Party has come to us

00:13:58.753 --> 00:14:00.147
and not the other way round.

00:14:00.738 --> 00:14:02.317
If she suits you then tell me.

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.692
I'll hit on her sister.

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:07.190
Anything for you.

00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:08.995
What are you doing?
She's seeing you.

00:14:09.618 --> 00:14:10.887
All right.

00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:13.427
Charu asked me to tell
you guys to join us.

00:14:13.689 --> 00:14:14.689
Yeah. The match starts soon.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.225
Yeah, we'll come and watch.

00:14:17.797 --> 00:14:20.408
Well, I was kind of hoping that
you three come and play as well.

00:14:20.535 --> 00:14:21.765
Make that four.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.670
I'm in.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.875
Pranav?

00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:31.612
He shaved!

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.004
Welcome to SPL - Satoliya Pithu Laghori,

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:41.680
Season 4 everybody.

00:14:42.046 --> 00:14:43.046
Now teams.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.841
On my right, we have

00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:46.421
his highness,

00:14:46.437 --> 00:14:47.357
alien,

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:48.057
sweetheart

00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:49.244
and Varanasi.

00:14:49.284 --> 00:14:50.204
On my left, we have,

00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:51.839
freshly divorced Chandan,

00:14:52.213 --> 00:14:54.204
last year's heavyweight - Chelsea,

00:14:54.229 --> 00:14:55.229
Chanchal

00:14:55.822 --> 00:14:57.633
and this guy!

00:14:58.164 --> 00:14:58.941
Now rules.

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.801
One team will destroy
this building

00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:02.163
with the ball and try to rebuild it.

00:15:02.188 --> 00:15:02.989
And the other team

00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:05.178
Will beat the crap out of them.

00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:06.213
So...

00:15:06.284 --> 00:15:07.490
Most importantly,

00:15:07.514 --> 00:15:09.196
no one cheats.

00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:10.970
Follow the rules.
Start!

00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:48.756
Just watch us.

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:50.248
Come on

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:00.751
Cheating!

00:16:02.076 --> 00:16:03.543
Mom, this is cheating.

00:17:00.361 --> 00:17:01.670
Awesome brownies.

00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:04.051
They contain Sangmomo's love.

00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:07.958
-Sangmo.
-Sangmo. Sangmo's love.

00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:14.736
Chanchal, your mom is awesome.

00:17:19.593 --> 00:17:20.593
Baba.

00:17:20.626 --> 00:17:21.626
Yeah?

00:17:22.094 --> 00:17:23.935
Why don't you hit on Varanasi?

00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:25.387
No.

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.411
Why?

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:28.165
Chelsea.

00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:31.462
Yes, Chelsea will be fine.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.196
Chelsea is fine, right?

00:17:34.165 --> 00:17:35.323
The name works out well.

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:37.292
See,

00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:39.713
Charu,

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:40.975
Chinmay,

00:17:41.252 --> 00:17:42.252
Cha-Cha,

00:17:42.793 --> 00:17:43.793
Chandan,

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:45.261
Paula.

00:17:45.705 --> 00:17:46.705
Cha-Pa.

00:17:46.904 --> 00:17:47.904
No,

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:48.919
it fails right from the very name.

00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:51.094
Cha-Pa, even the name has chutiyapa.
(Foolishness)

00:17:51.627 --> 00:17:53.174
Dad, I and Pranav are Cha-Pa.

00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:54.658
How?

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:55.270
What?

00:17:55.302 --> 00:17:56.302
Pranav.

00:17:56.548 --> 00:17:57.548
Pranav.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.580
Pa.

00:17:59.603 --> 00:18:01.500
But you're also a chutiya (fool). Cha.

00:18:02.945 --> 00:18:03.945
Papa!

00:18:04.927 --> 00:18:05.951
True.

00:18:15.874 --> 00:18:17.612
Hello, I'm a chutiya.

00:18:21.446 --> 00:18:23.923
Chanchal, your dad is also awesome.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.170
Now, only Chitvan has

00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:27.716
to find a Cha for him.

00:18:27.717 --> 00:18:28.946
There is one already, Charas.

00:18:34.296 --> 00:18:35.605
Awesome family.

00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:40.192
Awesome, awesome.

00:18:46.753 --> 00:18:50.508
♫ She tells everything ♫

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:55.633
♫ Doesn't hide anything ♫

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:05.019
♫ She tells everything ♫

♫ Are my friends ♫

00:19:33.648 --> 00:19:37.909

♫ Or is irrated ♫

00:19:49.665 --> 00:19:50.665
What happened?

00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:53.498
Nothing at all.

00:19:55.865 --> 00:19:56.865
I thought,

00:19:56.992 --> 00:19:59.682
I'll come to India after the divorce
and meet you guys...

00:20:01.913 --> 00:20:03.717
Made it somehow.

00:20:05.307 --> 00:20:06.307
Now what?

00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:09.632
There's no plan for the future.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.167
Don't think so hard about the future
that you forget to cherish the present.

00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:19.161
In this moment, this whiskey is amazing,

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:21.643
the music is all right,
there's cool breeze.

00:20:21.651 --> 00:20:22.651
Cherish it.

00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:28.445
Dad, I am not cherishing it.

00:20:29.721 --> 00:20:30.854
I'm feeling cold.

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:33.419
Use this shawl.

00:20:47.192 --> 00:20:48.258
That was simple.

00:20:49.668 --> 00:20:50.735
Most things are.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.212
I used to be like you before.

00:21:12.951 --> 00:21:15.847
Planning, system, clarity, chuityapa.

00:21:29.057 --> 00:21:30.991
One day, your mother asked me,

00:21:31.954 --> 00:21:33.636
"why are you running so much?"

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:35.875
Kids are gone and working on their lives.

00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:37.395
Fighting their fights.

00:21:37.937 --> 00:21:38.984
What are you doing?

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.450
I said, no,

00:21:43.953 --> 00:21:45.317
I'll work more.

00:21:46.952 --> 00:21:50.302
Make some investments,
get some more properties.

00:21:50.673 --> 00:21:52.037
Secure their future.

00:21:57.284 --> 00:21:58.093
She said,

00:21:58.133 --> 00:22:00.918
"Will we leave our kids
with a reason to fight?"

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.067
"Like everyone else."

00:22:04.903 --> 00:22:06.952
So after we're gone,

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.426
they fight over money and property.

00:22:13.826 --> 00:22:14.826
I said no,

00:22:15.255 --> 00:22:17.474
We'll leave them a place where

00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:19.421
they only get happiness.

00:22:22.807 --> 00:22:24.274
This is what we built.

00:22:27.997 --> 00:22:29.441
Amma's place.

00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:35.394
You'll only get happiness here.

00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:38.186
Make money on your own.

00:23:05.326 --> 00:23:07.259
I never said anything to you.

00:23:11.468 --> 00:23:12.468
But...

00:23:12.508 --> 00:23:13.722
Son, I love you.

00:23:15.087 --> 00:23:16.154
And I respect you.

00:23:20.207 --> 00:23:21.540
I love you too, dad.

00:23:29.289 --> 00:23:30.439
Baba, you're beautiful.

00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:40.817
You know what I'm saying, right?

00:23:41.064 --> 00:23:42.259
That last night was good.

00:23:42.284 --> 00:23:43.334
It was a good night.

00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:47.222
And I don't have any good news
right now but...

00:23:48.558 --> 00:23:50.106
It's possible.

00:23:50.392 --> 00:23:51.590
Pranav and you are sorted?

00:23:52.987 --> 00:23:53.971
Yeah.

00:23:53.979 --> 00:23:55.574
At least for the time being.

00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:57.690
Let's see what happens
once we go back.

00:23:58.468 --> 00:23:59.539
Where were you guys last night?

00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:00.801
Why didn't you join us?

00:24:01.142 --> 00:24:02.508
Chilling with Dad.

00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:03.699
What was he saying?

00:24:04.143 --> 00:24:05.802
That they won't leave us any money.

00:24:07.035 --> 00:24:07.749
What?

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.167
Yeah, he was talking like a saint.

00:24:10.662 --> 00:24:12.241
Baba seemed really impressed.

00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:14.997
Even you could have impressed
me in that atmosphere.

00:24:15.648 --> 00:24:18.012
I'm telling you it was
all due to the brownies.

00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:20.750
Pranav was also talking to me
in Marwari last night.

00:24:22.167 --> 00:24:23.700
Our parents drugged us.

00:24:24.207 --> 00:24:25.207
I love it!

00:24:25.508 --> 00:24:27.119
No, we'll manage.

00:24:27.445 --> 00:24:28.911
There's a lot of time.

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:30.509
There's time.

00:24:30.827 --> 00:24:32.358
Mom, I'm trying.

00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:37.581
By the way,

00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:39.623
Chelsea was asking about you.

00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:41.568
I knew it.

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:42.981
Not you.

00:24:44.365 --> 00:24:45.365
Me?

00:24:50.983 --> 00:24:52.196
Yeah, they'll come.

00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:54.605
How many do you want?

00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:57.141
Let's go.

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:00.632
Yeah, dad, but where?

00:25:00.823 --> 00:25:02.585
Where ever the road takes us.

00:25:02.595 --> 00:25:03.929
You people go ahead.

00:25:03.953 --> 00:25:06.419
I was thinking about
going out with Pranav.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.436
So you guys carry on.

00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:09.936
Yeah, I had to go somewhere
to meet someone.

00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:10.953
You guys enjoy.

00:25:11.529 --> 00:25:12.396
Who is it?

00:25:12.776 --> 00:25:14.942
What's your plan in life now?

00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.181
Mom,

00:25:16.816 --> 00:25:18.212
don't think so hard about the future,

00:25:18.229 --> 00:25:19.379
that you forget to cherish the present.

00:25:19.737 --> 00:25:22.464
In this moment,
i'm going to meet Chelsea.

00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:23.837
Post that,

00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:25.235
we'll see what happens.

00:25:25.354 --> 00:25:27.218
Woah!

00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:29.274
Son of a bitch,
Stole my line.

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:29.984
Excuse me.

00:25:32.048 --> 00:25:33.048
It was my line.

00:25:33.222 --> 00:25:35.246
Yeah, but whom did
you call a bitch?

00:25:36.556 --> 00:25:37.071
What?

00:25:37.254 --> 00:25:38.654
That's horrible, dad.

00:25:38.873 --> 00:25:39.976
Not done.

00:25:42.683 --> 00:25:43.816
Give me the keys.

00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:44.809
Dad, I’ll drive.

00:25:44.817 --> 00:25:45.817
Give it.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.920
Listen, let me drive.

00:25:46.937 --> 00:25:47.412
I drive, man.

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:48.429
You love your Tiago so much?
