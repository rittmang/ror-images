WEBVTT

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:35.917
Guys. Enough of the random searching.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.583
It is time to approach the Police.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.167
I think you're forgetting
that we are running from the Police.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.500
Yes, but how would the local
Police know about Rajasthan, Baba?

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:45.708
I don't think they talk.

00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:47.833
They know we are in Calcutta.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.250
What?
- How?

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:51.833
Mom said they showed it on the news.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:54.750
Someone even showed
our photo at the market.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.375
Did mom tell you how I looked?

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:57.333
One minute.
One minute.

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:59.125
Let's be practical here.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.000
Pranav came to Gangtok from Kolkata.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:03.542
Why?

00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:07.458
Why?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.542
Why?
- Think about why he came.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:12.917
Does he have a connection with Gangtok?

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.833
Does he have an uncle
here too with whom he is close?

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:20.208
The momos here are good.
- Keep your mouth shut.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:21.583
He's a foodie.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.583
If he can go to Calcutta
for sweet dumplings..

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.375
..can't he come here for momos?

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.875
I can't think of any connection
as such with Gangtok.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.042
Pranav ran away from home.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:32.583
Why?

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:36.500
Because your book made his life hell.
- Right.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.292
Sorry about that.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.000
So he ran away to..

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.708
Kill himself.

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.833
To get away from everything, I guess.

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:49.708
Why here?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.875
He could have gone further away from here.

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:53.458
Nepal.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.375
Even gambling is legal over there.

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:56.750
Gambling is legal over here too.

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:58.208
Sure, but our currency
is strong over there, Baba.

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.542
He is not fond of gambling.
- Oh.

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.167
Then, it's Bhutan.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:04.750
Everyone is happy over there.

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:06.333
He must have gone looking for happiness.

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:08.250
What is Gangtok famous for?

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.500
Tea.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:16.125
Natural beauty.
- Where are we going with this, brother?

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:17.875
Organic farming.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.208
Carpets.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:20.750
Buddhism.

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:23.958
Ginger flavored liquor.

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:25.333
Wait.

00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:27.667
He has come here to hide.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.167
For peace of mind.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:33.958
I saw a book on chanting on his bookshelf.

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:39.667
He was talking about making
a documentary when we were dating.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:44.167
Crap!

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.583
The answer is in front of us.

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:47.917
Yeah!

00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:48.917
What?

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:49.625
Monks?

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:51.500
Pranav was eating momos
in peace over here..

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.625
..when these beggars cast
a spell and kidnapped him.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.958
Look at what's next to
the bag of the one on the left.

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:00.042
See.

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:01.458
I was right.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.125
They even stole his sweet
dumplings after killing Pranav.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.042
Go and pay the bill.
I'm going to talk to them.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:07.875
Baba.

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.417
I know how to talk to these people.

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.417
Go and clear the bill first.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.875
Then you can talk.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:17.917
Sure?
- Yes.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.292
I'm also coming.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.458
Baba.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.708
Money.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.083
Come.

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:42.792
Baba, where are we going?
- Ranka monastery.

00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:43.792
Why?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.542
That tin was recycled from
the garbage over there just this week.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.792
Is Pranav's dead body over there?

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:49.250
Shut up, Chits!

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.875
Damn!

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:19.042
Even the local Police are coming here.

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.417
You keep your mouth shut.
- Yeah.

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:38.375
Now what?
- I'll handle this.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:39.375
How?

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.042
Chit's got a special set of skills.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:42.417
What?
- Don't take a risk.

00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.042
What is he doing?

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:45.333
Excuse me.

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:47.750
Greetings.

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.958
How do we get to Ranka monastery?

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:56.042
How does he manage this every time?

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.875
Is he speaking Nepali?

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.333
Ranka.
- Oh!

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:05.500
He always creates a mess.

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:06.500
I..

00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:10.000
What are you doing?
- Escaping. God damn it!

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.458
But, Chitwan?
- He keeps going to jail.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.375
He won't have a problem.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.125
Brother, I'm a friend.

00:07:15.208 --> 00:07:15.667
(Nepali)

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.750
Bring the vehicle.
Bring the vehicle.

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:32.917
Get off.
Get off.

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:33.542
What do you mean?

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:34.917
I think this unpaved
road leads to the monastery.

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:36.250
Go and look for Pranav.

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:37.292
And you?
- Just get out.

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:38.542
I shall distract them.

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:40.958
Excuse me.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.750
Excuse me.

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:58.667
My husband.

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:06.208
Excuse me.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:08.208
My husband.

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:09.958
Have you seen him?

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:12.500
Ask him?

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.042
Okay.
Thank you.

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:36.042
Pranav?

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:47.958
Chanchal.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.208
So nice to see you.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.667
Pranav.
- No attachments.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.583
What?

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.000
Anyway, now that you're found,

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:17.708
you will return and
sort everything, right?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.750
Return?

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.583
No, Chanchal.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.750
This is my home now.

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:25.708
What?

00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.042
Pranav, have you lost your mind?

00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:29.750
I have found my mind.

00:11:30.417 --> 00:11:31.500
And inner peace.

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:33.208
What is wrong with you?

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:35.583
The outside world is wrong, Chanchal.

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:38.042
Here, everything is right.

00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:42.083
What about your family?

00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:43.958
What about your people?

00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:45.958
What about us?

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.500
I have thought about us.

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:52.042
You come here too, Chanchal.

00:11:53.417 --> 00:11:54.375
Come here now.

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:55.458
I want to light the candles.

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.167
Side. Please.

00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:03.750
You found me.

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:09.750
Now find yourself.

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:13.583
Found her.

00:12:13.708 --> 00:12:14.542
Here!

00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:17.708
Well, we found all three.

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:23.708
Chandan sa badan, chanchal, chitwan.

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:26.250
I always hated that song very much.

00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:27.875
Hated that song.

00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:29.458
To hell with your hatred.

00:12:29.542 --> 00:12:30.750
Here's Pranav.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:32.042
Brother-in-law?

00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:36.500
She is lying.
This is not Pranav.

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:37.792
You are right.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.583
I am not Pranav.

00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:41.167
You see?

00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:44.042
What the hell are you doing?
- Chanchal. Language.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.875
To hell with my language.
What are you saying?

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:47.542
There is no Pranav over here.

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:49.417
My name is Mantramukt.

00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:51.583
Pranav?
- No, brother Chandan.

00:12:52.042 --> 00:12:52.833
Mantramukt.

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:56.042
Pranav, please stop talking
nonsense and tell them who you are.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.333
Else they will put me
behind bars for your murder.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:12:59.750
Yes.

00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:00.917
This is brother-in-law.

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:02.458
Nice look, brother-in-law.

00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:04.250
You look like a bald Harry Potter.

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:06.750
All of them are in cahoots.

00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:08.208
Pranav is dead.

00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:09.250
You're right.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.750
Pranav is no longer in this world.
- Pranav!

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.333
Come to your senses, brother.
- I've come to my senses after many years.

00:13:16.792 --> 00:13:18.042
Hey, India's Dr. Stein!

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:19.208
We are in trouble here..

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.750
..and all you can think
of now is mysticism?

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:23.125
I think he's upset about the book.

00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:24.292
Baba, apologize to him.

00:13:24.417 --> 00:13:24.792
Okay.

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.583
Pranav, I'm sorry about Tripling.

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:28.708
Stop their family discussion!

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:29.625
Please arrest her.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.417
Please don't do this.

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:33.500
I really need you right now.

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:35.333
Need is the enemy of man.

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:37.250
Pranav, it was a goddamn joke, man!

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:39.000
It wasn't even my joke.
It was his joke.

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:40.833
How was it my joke?
I said it seriously.

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:42.458
Didn't you say brother-in-law is impotent?

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:43.958
I did not tell you to
write it in the book, Baba.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.333
You said something and I wrote it.

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:46.875
Man's thoughts are...

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.792
I am writing a book.
I am earning money.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.833
Anger is man's worst enemy.

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.125
Please shut up!
I'm pregnant, goddamn it!

00:13:57.583 --> 00:13:58.667
Huh?

00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:06.792
I'm pregnant.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:17.208
Nice try, Chanchal.

00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:20.333
Didn't you tell this
lie the last time as well?

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:21.417
Yes, Chanchu.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.833
The same trick does not
work on the same audience.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.500
Please! Arrest her!

00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:17.417
Stop!

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:44.750
Don't anybody dare to touch my wife!

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:46.917
Release her brothers too.

00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.000
Right now!

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:49.417
Pranav?

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:51.500
You should be ashamed of yourself,
sister-in-law?

00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:54.458
You stooped so low for position?

00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:57.583
I feel disgust for you!

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.542
Disgust?
- Hatred.

00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:05.375
Make arrangements for my return.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.708
Pranav.

00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:09.750
Will you please lower
the standard of your Hindi?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.875
This is not the Northwest.
It is the Northeast.

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:19.667
Sir, he says, "Let go off his hand."

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:21.000
He is alive.

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:22.458
So everything is fine.

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.167
We understand, Baba.

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:29.042
Thank you.

00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:30.625
Can one smoke here?

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:41.750
I'm sorry.

00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:11.458
What are these glasses?
- It created a look.

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.333
They're not numbered.

00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:20.000
Brother-in-law is impotent.

00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:35.625
Ultimate, lively, entertaining,

00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.625
super duper all time blockbuster!

00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.083
Baba, you're too beautiful.

00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:41.500
It is the best of Bollywood.

00:18:41.583 --> 00:18:42.875
It covers all genres.

00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:43.583
Very good!

00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:44.125
Fantastic!

00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:46.833
Baba is beautiful.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.417
Chitwan has acted very well.

00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:49.583
Even I am going to dye my hair green.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.750
Brother-in-law is impotent!

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.167
It's a fantastic movie!

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.333
Chitwan is..

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.083
We love you, Chitwan!

00:18:58.333 --> 00:18:59.792
I think it will earn 250 crores.

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:01.500
Baba, you're beautiful!
I love you.

00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:02.417
Four star.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.417
Ten star out of five.
Take them all.

00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:06.833
Surely they deserve four to five stars.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.708
Chandan, Chanchal,
Chitwan, welcome to the show.

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:13.042
Thank you.
- Congratulations on the film.

00:19:13.208 --> 00:19:14.917
Thank you.
- Thank you so much for having us.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:18.083
You know I tend to talk
to actors and filmmakers usually..

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:22.000
..but this time I'm talking to
people on whose life a movie is based.

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.775
And it's not even like
y'all are achievers..

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.080
..or sportsmen or great leaders.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.542
Y'all are average Joe's.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:29.458
Regular people.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.875
Yeah, we are pretty..

00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:32.458
..regular.

00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:35.292
Well, I'm royalty.

00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:36.042
So..

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:37.583
Not regular.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.083
You know, I liked the film.

00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:42.000
I enjoyed the film.

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:45.417
I think the banter between
the siblings really works.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:47.792
It seems kind of real.
It makes the film lively.

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.583
But, you guys really abuse each other.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.750
Yeah, I mean, you know, when
I was writing the book, so I thought..

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.333
I did not want to portray
a very sanitized relationship..

00:20:00.417 --> 00:20:01.417
..between siblings, you know.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.833
I wanted to portray a very
realistic and raw relationship.

00:20:04.917 --> 00:20:06.333
Swear words and all..
- Yeah.

00:20:06.583 --> 00:20:08.083
Swearing just happens.

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:09.958
Dad has been swearing
at me since I was young.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.375
She has been swearing
at me since the day I was born.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:16.625
When siblings fight there's
bound to be swearing, right?

00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:18.417
Not really.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.750
When fighting with
your siblings you never..?

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:24.417
No. Not really.

00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:26.958
But anyway, you know, it's nice.

00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:29.292
I like it. It's fun.

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:33.417
What I want to ask you is,
ya'll don't seem particularly connected.

00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:35.375
Ya'll don't really stay in touch.

00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:37.292
There's not a lot of
connection between ya'll.

00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:39.750
Little bit, you know.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.125
We stay in touch, you know.

00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:44.667
I mean, we connect and call on and off.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.250
We touch base, you know.

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:49.417
See. The important thing is that
we're always there for each other.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.708
Yeah.
- Always.

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:54.458
I wanna ask you,
are you not concerned, Chandan?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.917
First the book, now the film.

00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:58.375
No offence, but..

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:01.375
..you know, people might think
of ya'll as a whacked out family.

00:21:01.833 --> 00:21:04.417
Possibly even,
you know, borderline dysfunctional.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:06.125
No.

00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:07.000
I don't think so.

00:21:07.042 --> 00:21:09.083
I mean, my father always told me that..

00:21:09.417 --> 00:21:12.875
..family is the only thing that
can afford to be dysfunctional, you know.

00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.583
It's like this mattress that
you know you can fall back on.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's always there.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.250
Whenever you're in crisis..

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:26.000
..you know that your family is
going to stand by you and support you.

00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:29.667
You know, the thing is,
only family supports you during a crisis.

00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:31.250
That's nicely put.
- Thanks.

00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:32.667
That's my line.

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.458
Yeah. He said that once.

00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:35.458
That's my line.

00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:37.250
Even the guy said it well in the film.

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:37.833
That chap..

00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:38.667
Yeah.
The hero.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.125
He's very good.
He said it well.

00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:40.750
Nice.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.542
You seem to like the film.
- Yeah, I like it.

00:21:43.708 --> 00:21:47.208
He could have had a little more swag.

00:21:47.542 --> 00:21:47.750
Right?

00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:48.750
He's very nice.

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:49.333
I like him.

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:50.750
Chandan, what do you think of the film?

00:21:51.042 --> 00:21:51.833
I quite like the film.

00:21:52.042 --> 00:21:53.833
The thing is, it's very well made.

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:55.542
Of course,
when they were making the film..

00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:57.458
..there were some
creative differences but..

00:21:57.667 --> 00:22:00.000
..finally the end
product is so well made..

00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:01.208
I hate the film.

00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:04.042
What was that?
- I hate the film.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:06.375
I'm sorry.
I can't pretend anymore.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.250
I just hated it.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:10.583
You know, when I read his book,
I thought, that's nonsense..

00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:13.083
..and I thought it was
really crappy but that was okay.

00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:13.958
It was average.

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:14.708
The film is absolutely absurd!
- Really?

00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:15.792
It's a bestseller.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.083
I mean, I don't understand how is it
making so much money at the box-office.

00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:20.208
I mean, just think of it.

00:22:20.292 --> 00:22:21.917
It's sexist. It's crude.

00:22:22.125 --> 00:22:23.000
It's just so..

00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:24.708
I mean, you know it's looking like..

00:22:24.792 --> 00:22:27.708
..I'm some widowed daughter-in-law
or something from a soap opera.

00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:30.792
So say you have a problem
with the casting, Chanchu.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.792
You don't like the girl.
- Yeah.

00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:33.083
What the hell is the casting!

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:34.667
The film is fine.
- It is a little off.

00:22:34.917 --> 00:22:36.083
He is looking like the hero.
- Yes.

00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:38.458
And he's not supposed
to be the hero of the film.

00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:39.042
Yeah, he's looking like..

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:40.333
No, of course.
You're not.

00:22:40.417 --> 00:22:41.125
Why are you looking like the hero?

00:22:41.208 --> 00:22:42.625
They should have actually
cast the hero for my part.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:44.042
Nobody is the hero here.
- I am the hero.

00:22:44.083 --> 00:22:45.833
They will cast someone boring
for a boring character won't they?

00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:48.375
They really needed to get
someone who looks like royalty.

00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:50.083
You know,
someone who commands that presence.

00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:51.917
You're not royalty.
Of course, I'm a royal.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.542
What do you mean I'm not royalty?

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:56.250
How can you be royalty?
- Of course, I'm royalty.

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:58.667
Look at this royal baby I'm carrying here.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.625
Who is the real hero in the film?
