WEBVTT

00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:53.278
Shall we?

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.709
Baba, you're feeling dizzy?

00:00:57.084 --> 00:00:59.167
My fuse has blown.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
it's because you didn't come with me in our childhood

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
The restaurant is closed.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.959
Baba...Camel.

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.250
Baba, first the giant wheel
and now the café.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.040
Fun times.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.385
Look human camel.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.642
Cheetah would enjoy seeing him.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.750
Chitwan, shut up!

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:28.417
Chanchal.

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:29.334
Chanchu.

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:30.459
Chancal.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.792
What is going on, Chanchal?

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:42.209
Hey.

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:44.334
Are you gonna talk to me or what?

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:46.667
I think she's lost her memory.

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:47.875
Chanchu.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.042
This is Chandan.

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:50.334
Baba beautiful.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.709
Chitwan.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.167
Your favorite Chits.

00:01:54.334 --> 00:01:55.209
Have you forgotten?

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.125
Your men put a gun to my head.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.125
They kidnapped us
and put us on the giant wheel.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.625
I see.
- You see?

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.125
Good.
Because I don't.

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:04.334
What the hell is happening?

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:09.459
What is this?
- Read it.

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.875
The book Tripling by Chandan Sharma
has brought tremendous disrepute..

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.625
..and trauma to the prestigious
Singh family of Jodhpur.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.167
It misleads people into believing
that their heir Kunwar Pranav Singh..

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.959
..is impotent and incompetent.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.667
What is this?

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.500
Lawsuit.

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:30.584
You're suing me?

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.917
If your film production
doesn't stop immediately..

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.959
..you will have to pay our
family 500 million rupees in damages.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.084
500 million?

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.084
Are you crazy?
- Exactly.

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:42.167
Why would our family get it?
Pranav's family will..

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:45.292
Sorry. Sorry. Continue.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.000
How could you do this to me?

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.292
I am your sister by birth.

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:53.084
I wouldn't hurt you even
if you were my step sister.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.750
You guys are making
a mountain of a mole hill.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.375
How dare you say Pranav is impotent!

00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:58.959
Couples say irrelevant
things to each other in anger.

00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:01.209
Does that mean you can spice it
up and print it in your book?

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.792
Did you once think of the repercussions?

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.000
I haven't even mentioned impotency.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.334
Why don't you read the book?

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.000
I simply hinted that Pranav
might not be too sexually active.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.334
How the hell do you know that?

00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:14.750
Do you come and sleep in
our bedroom with us every day?

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:15.917
Chanchal, don't be absurd!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.167
Baba, brother-in-law is
not that sexually inactive.

00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:19.917
I heard plenty of sounds in Manali.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.209
I got out for a smoke.

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:25.667
You two were playing polo.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.667
Tents aren't soundproof.
- Chitwan, shut up.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.834
Read the book once
and you will understand everything.

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:33.584
How does it matter now?

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:38.334
Pranav left me.
- What?

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.375
Suicide?
- Shut up, Chiwan!

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:43.542
We don't know anything yet.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.000
He is missing.

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:50.334
Nobody said anything when
the book was released.

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.917
It was when the film was
announced that they realized..

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.250
..that their governance
and the future MLA has been ridiculed.

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:02.042
After being banned in Rajasthan
the book's sales went up.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.625
That's when somebody tweeted about it.

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.250
Hashtag, brother-in-law is impotent.
- Hey!

00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:08.125
That's my line.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.375
It went viral.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.709
People started talking crap about it.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.292
And one week before elections
the party asked him to step down.

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:30.584
I even tried to call mum
and dad, but they were unreachable.

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:35.292
I tried calling you also
but as usual you were unavailable.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.000
I was in the US.

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.000
On a book tour.

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:39.459
Mom and dad are on a cruise.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.875
You must have not got
through to my phone either.

00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:44.750
I changed the phone and number
when I was released from jail.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:47.917
Sorry.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.250
It has been 20 days.

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:57.667
When I woke up in the morning
some clothes, his boots..

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:00.500
..a bag and he were missing.
- Missing?

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:01.375
Where did he go?

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:03.834
Would Chanchu be upset
if she knew that, Baba?

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.584
And why are you going around in
a sari like Katrina Kaif of politics.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.125
I am the MLA of the
constituency, damn it!

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.250
Crap!

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:16.167
Nice!

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:20.000
When Pranav stepped down the
party felt I should step up.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.125
It would appear that
I am supporting him.

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.209
Rajput wives are strong anyways.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:28.334
It was a case of sympathy votes
and I won the election.

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:31.209
Even Pranav was very supportive.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.417
But after the elections..

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.375
..rumors of the king being
impotent spread even more.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.334
Two days later Pranav disappeared.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:41.750
He just left.

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:54.959
And the worst part is,
everyone at the mansion feels..

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:57.375
..that I got Pranav killed for power.

00:05:57.917 --> 00:05:59.000
What?

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:00.792
This is because of you.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.042
Baba, this is wrong.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:02.709
Okay.

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:06.084
First of all nowhere have
I written that Pranav is impotent.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:09.792
I wrote that incident as
a joke when you two were arguing..

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.875
..and he very innocently asked me,
"Is brother-in-law impotent?

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:15.417
I thought it was a f****** joke,
which was hilarious..

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.334
..but if you take it out
of context and look at it..

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:19.459
I don't care about
your God damn context!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.375
And I think I never said it, Baba.

00:06:21.584 --> 00:06:23.000
Damn you, B******!
Of course you said it.

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:24.167
Baba, respect.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.792
You are older but I too am a father.

00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:28.000
You are on probation!
Don't brag.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:28.917
Wait.
What the hell!

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:30.334
You have a child?
- Yes.

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:31.292
I am not impotent.
- Scumbag!

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:33.167
That is not your biological child.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.375
Baba, don't put logic
where there's emotion.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.875
Biological, Chitwan.

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:38.250
Excuse me, highness.

00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:40.417
The younger highness has arrived.
- Witch!

00:06:41.084 --> 00:06:44.292
What's the matter?
- The witch is hounding me.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:46.375
She spread the rumor that
I killed Pranav..

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.125
..and buried his body
somewhere in the vicinity.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.667
Crime patrol is going on here.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:52.667
The lunatic has her
own investigation going.

00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:55.417
We find pits dug up around
the mansion every second day.

00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:58.125
As thought I killed Pranav,
dug a pit and buried him there.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.292
What?

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:01.459
Greetings, highness.

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:03.417
A frame has been found ten
yards from the mansion.

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.417
Frame?
- Skeleton.

00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:08.709
The clothing resembles the
king's and the bones are recent..

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:11.334
..so Ms. Nirmala claims it is Mr. Pranav.

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.792
What do you mean that she claims it?
- Exactly.

00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:17.500
You people cannot make
accusations without concrete evidence.

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:20.292
Chanchu, don't worry.

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:23.000
My girlfriend is a top lawyer.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.334
Shut up, Chitwan.

00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:26.542
A corpse doesn't turn
into a skeleton in 3 weeks.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:27.917
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:07:28.084 --> 00:07:29.875
The media and Police have
arrived at the mansion.

00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:30.875
And here too.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.334
Ms. Nirmala has brought them.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.209
Highness.
Highness.

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:37.834
There is turmoil in the local party
office on hearing this news.

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.292
The party President
has summoned you.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.542
Damn!
I need to fix this.

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.375
Bring the car at the back.

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:46.000
I will go to the
headquarters right away.

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:48.500
Baba.
Let's go.

00:07:49.042 --> 00:07:51.000
We shall go there
and demonstrate unity.

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.667
Go and see where Chanchal is.

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:20.667
Hi, sister-in-law.
- Nirmala.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:22.625
My name is Nirmala.

00:08:23.834 --> 00:08:25.792
The last time you did not
give me a chance to tell you.

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.584
Why are you doing this?

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:29.750
Chanchal hasn't done anything.

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:33.084
Possibly.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.209
But it is also possible
that she has done it.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:40.084
People instigate riots
for political power..

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.959
..and get hundreds of people killed.

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:45.417
Father, brother,
husband, sister.

00:08:46.084 --> 00:08:47.417
These relationships mean nothing.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.375
Look at history.

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:51.584
Chanchal has no interest in politics.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Only because she was pressurized..
- Oh!

00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:57.667
Possibly.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.542
But it is also possible that
she is telling lies.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.209
Like she did the last time.

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:04.792
About being pregnant.

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:07.042
Look.

00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:10.542
Chanchal loves Pranav very much.
- What is love?

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:13.167
Even I loved Pranav's older brother.

00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:14.459
What happened?

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:16.542
He got paralyzed in a polo accident.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.375
Neck down.

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:20.459
I hope you understand.

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:27.459
Then he suffered a stroke,
I thought finally, but he survived.

00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:30.209
Then..

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:32.417
..I met you.

00:09:33.084 --> 00:09:34.000
Tall.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:35.834
Handsome.

00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:38.834
Not paralyzed.

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:40.000
You see.

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:43.167
On top of it you are rich
and you are an author.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.917
Family has a criminal background.

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:48.334
But..

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:50.959
..you didn't even ask me my name.

00:09:51.084 --> 00:09:52.792
Look, sister-in-law.
Nirmala.

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:54.834
What happened to you was very bad.

00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:56.917
But..
- You know I have a lineage?

00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:01.959
I have far more knowledge than
Chanchal about our history, culture..

00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:06.084
..our society and this
political situation.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.625
I thought that the party would
ask me to step forward.

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:13.875
But I am not fair skinned.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.792
I don't look desirable.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.250
No.
That is not true.

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:20.417
Even you are desirable.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.709
It's just..
- Really?

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:23.542
Am I..

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:28.000
desirable?
- Sister-in-law, please behave yourself.

00:10:28.084 --> 00:10:30.334
You have created too
many problems already.

00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:33.334
The problems haven't even begun
as yet, Chandan Sharma.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.375
Your sister's done.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.334
I will destroy her!

00:10:39.084 --> 00:10:40.151
You won't be able to.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.160
Because she is not alone like you.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.917
We are with her.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.792
It is being said that your sister
has a hand in this murder.

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.084
Is that true?

00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:56.667
What do you have
to say about this, sir?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.667
Look, please don't
teach me the law.

00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:00.292
My child's mother is a top lawyer.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.709
But what about the bones that are found?
- Feed them to the dogs.

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:05.500
In any case a corpse doesn't
turn into a skeleton in 3 days.

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:06.834
Chitwan.
- It takes time.

00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:10.750
What the hell are you doing?

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:12.875
We have to keep them busy, Baba..

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.459
..so that Chanchal
gets away from the back.

00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:16.209
What?
- Let's go.

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:17.000
Let's go.

00:11:17.084 --> 00:11:18.209
O, God! You..!

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:20.709
This is a whisper.

00:11:20.917 --> 00:11:22.375
And this is moronic!

00:11:25.709 --> 00:11:26.625
Chanchal, my dear.

00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:28.875
We totally agree with you.

00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:32.500
And we know that you did
not get the Kunwar killed.

00:11:32.584 --> 00:11:33.750
Why don't you understand?

00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:35.417
This evidence is Nirmala's ploy.

00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:37.459
She is instigating the public
by spreading such rumors.

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:38.584
She is absolutely correct.

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:39.875
She should be the one in politics.

00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:40.875
Look, my dear.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.500
The atmosphere is not good.

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.917
The media wants sensational news.

00:11:45.334 --> 00:11:46.542
The public is impetuous.

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:48.500
And your brother's advent
under the circumstances.

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:52.667
You are aware everyone here is
against his obscene book.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.000
Consequently it would be best
you go away for a few days.

00:11:57.875 --> 00:11:59.334
Run away out of fear?
- No.

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.375
Go and look for Pranav.

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:04.250
Only Pranav's safety
can shut them up.

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:06.625
But if I leave..
- Please come quickly.

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.125
People are shouting slogans.

00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:09.750
And something is written
on the banners.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:11.417
Her highness is a murderer.

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:23.334
Chanchal has become a politician.

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:24.709
We met her at the carnival.

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:25.834
Pranav is lost.

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:27.292
No, no.

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:28.542
Not in the carnival, baby.

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:30.834
Actually Baba wrote in the
book that he is impotent.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:31.750
Hey!

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.584
Not Chanchal, baby.

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:34.917
Anyway, forget all that.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.459
Basically the problem now is
that there is a skeleton.

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:41.042
No.
Not in her closet, baby.

00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:42.584
And it isn't even Pranav's.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.667
The naughty sister-in-law
played a game.

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:49.250
No, I'm not high.

00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:51.209
I swear.
- Hello.

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:53.667
Hello..?
- Yes, Chanchal.

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:57.542
You stay there.
We are coming.

00:12:58.667 --> 00:12:59.459
One second.

00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:00.709
Sri Maheshwari Bhavan.

00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:01.750
Check that on the map.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:03.167
Yes.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.459
You stay there.
We are coming.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.334
Yeah. Okay.

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:09.292
Okay.

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:12.125
We must pick up Chanchal
and leave quickly.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.709
Road trip?

00:13:14.584 --> 00:13:15.875
We have to go looking for Pranav.

00:13:16.584 --> 00:13:18.584
We have to go straight, right?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.375
Chitwan, what the hell are you doing?
- Shhh!

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.209
My child is sleeping.

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:25.334
What..?

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:29.709
Are you crazy, scumbag?

00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:30.750
I am telling you to look at the map..

00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:32.084
..and you are busy on the phone.

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:33.334
Baba, you keep swearing at me.

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:35.667
Our family is growing.
You are older.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.417
You have to set an example
for the youngsters.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.125
Come on!

00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:38.917
Damn!

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:39.375
Get out.

00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:40.375
Get out of the car!

00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:42.584
Baba, technically
the car is mine.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.959
I'll go.
- Hey.

00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:47.917
Baba?

00:13:49.042 --> 00:13:49.709
Sister-in-law is behind.

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.084
They never want to solve the problem.

00:13:51.209 --> 00:13:52.750
They always try to increase it.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.250
As it is I don't have
network at this time.

00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:10.750
Psst.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.334
What?
- We have to go in this direction.

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:16.709
Did you see the map?
- Yeah.

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:20.292
Let's go.

00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:33.709
Baba.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:36.250
When you're angry
you're more beautiful.

00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:41.875
Down with her highness!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.375
Down with her highness!

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.917
Down with her highness!

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.417
Down with her highness!

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.084
Down with her highness!

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:49.500
Down with her highness!

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:51.084
Down with her highness!

00:14:51.167 --> 00:14:53.000
Down with her highness!

00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:00.584
Open the gate!

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:03.500
Down with her highness!

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.084
Down with her highness!

00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.584
Down with her highness!

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:15.459
Down with her highness!

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:17.084
Down with her highness!

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.667
Down with her highness!

00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:20.000
Chanchal, hop in.
They got away!

00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:40.084
The main accused of Kunwar
Pranav Singh murder..

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:43.417
..his wife Chanchal has absconded
with the help of her two brothers.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.542
If the people here are
to be believed..

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:49.250
..both her brothers are involved
in this murder with her.

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:53.334
This is Bunty Chaurasia with
cameraman Dilip Pradhan, C star news.

00:16:05.292 --> 00:16:06.334
Chanchu.

00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:12.834
I'm really sorry you went through
so much trouble because of me.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.000
I'm very sad that we are
in this situation..

00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:25.834
..but I'm very happy that
we're all together now..

00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:30.125
..and we are handling
this situation maturely.

00:17:10.417 --> 00:17:12.584
Bro, you are genius!

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:13.375
Why?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.917
I mean, how?

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.167
I am watching the news now.

00:17:17.292 --> 00:17:18.875
Siblings absconding.
The impotent brother-in-law is missing.

00:17:19.084 --> 00:17:20.417
The plot for part two is fixed.

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:23.500
And I'm excited because this time..

00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:27.042
Bye.

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:35.084
You're gonna be a franchise.

00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:38.375
We're like Marvel, Baba.

00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:46.625
Will my doll also be made, Baba?
- No.
