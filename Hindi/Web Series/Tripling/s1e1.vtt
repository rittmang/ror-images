00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.631
What comes to your mind
when you hear the words road trip?

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:25.224
<i>Hangover?</i>

00:00:25.407 --> 00:00:27.111
<i>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara?</i>

00:00:27.373 --> 00:00:29.087
<i>Dil Chahta Hai?</i>

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.019
Basically friends...

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:34.114
Having fun,
rocking it

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:36.301
Baba, what are you doing?

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:36.912
Bastard!

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:40.468
But would you ever consider doing
a road trip with your siblings?

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:41.852
Jerk!

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:44.038
A road trip with your brother and sister?

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.292
It could be fun, you know.

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:47.197
You're dead!

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:54.031
Baba, mind your language!

00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:58.788
Ah! You're choking me!

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.557
Let go my hair, you ass.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.383
-Dog!
-I'm gonna...

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:12.638
Baba, I was worried about you.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:16.636
Baba's become an animal!

00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:19.351
You betrayed me!

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:23.813
Hey, that's your car!

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:30.162
What the fuck!

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:32.428
What stupidity is this?

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.509
Did Chanchal take the car?

00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:36.446
I've always had my doubts about her.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.421
Hey!
You're the one who looks like a thief.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.694
I was watching your pansy fight.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.449
If everyone is here
then who took the car?

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:47.964
Even the RV isn't there!

00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:49.290
Oh, shit!

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:50.871
Oh, fuck!

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.698
Baba, I'm so sorry.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.585
Shut your music down
and raise the volume of this match!

00:02:57.268 --> 00:02:58.228
Chitvan...

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:00.879
Bro, you're an artist,

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.122
extremely talented
and I really love your music.

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:04.901
But these guys clearly don't.

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:08.827
What are you saying, bro?
The crowd is loving it! Look at them.

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:14.863
Try to understand the situation
atleast once.

00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:17.172
Everyone will dance once
the match gets over.

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:19.601
Now lower the volume
and play something from this pen-drive.

00:03:19.617 --> 00:03:20.388
Take a break.

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:40.270
Baba?

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:41.599
Hey, Chitvan. You're here.

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:43.869
Baba, this is such a surprise...

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.969
Watch it, man.
You're peeing on my shoe.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.755
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I got excited.

00:03:48.382 --> 00:03:49.517
What are you doing here?

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:50.624
Taking a piss.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.751
I mean, here, in the club.

00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:54.270
I came to meet you.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.671
Bombay? What are you
doing in India?

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:59.970
I sent you an e-mail.

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:03.369
I was waiting at the airport for you since
5:00 and finally decided to come myself.

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:04.471
Baba...

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.444
I only check emails
at 11:45 a.m. on Mondays

00:04:12.178 --> 00:04:15.369
But now that you're here, tell me.

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:18.527
I got divorced.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:22.559
Divorce?

00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:25.974
When did you get  married?

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:28.347
What drugs are you on?

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:31.799
Weren't you living with that
foreigner boss of yours?

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:32.672
Yes.

00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:33.955
Whom did you marry?

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:34.894
To her only!

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:37.434
But wasn't she quite elder to you?

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:38.565
So?

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.327
When did you married?

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:45.222
Six months back.

00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:47.373
You didn't even invite me!

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:49.388
Are you a fool?

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:51.559
We talked on the phone.
You congratulated me.

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.019
We had a Skype chat.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:54.693
Oh, really?

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:56.851
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.389
Are you done?
Because I got done.

00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:07.508
I'm just giving
you some company.

00:05:08.714 --> 00:05:10.720
Baba, it's so nice to see you!

00:05:10.737 --> 00:05:12.155
What are you doing?
Wash your hands.

00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:20.776
That's all he's told me, dad.

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:22.341
I'll call you once I know the details.

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:24.085
Yeah, all right

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:25.633
Okay. Bye.

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:34.430
Don't spill any of this to our parents.

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.471
Sure.

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.491
Compatibility is...

00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:47.986
A bitch.

00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:51.134
Mother fucking!

00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:53.826
Love and stuff is still simple

00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:57.218
But just that tuning...

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:58.718
That's important.

00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:01.683
Because if you want two
different things in life,

00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:03.893
It fucking never works.

00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:06.256
Baba, I've heard that these foreigners...

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:08.171
particularly the cougar types.

00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:10.344
They tend to dominate

00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:11.299
Yeah, man.

00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.657
They get egoistic.

00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:17.915
They enjoy playing these power,
position, and status games

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:19.545
I get scared of all of this.

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:21.018
Handcuffs,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.665
leather,

00:06:22.408 --> 00:06:23.771
Using hunters and all

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:27.168
Like all the women in the world are out
to get revenge for <i>50 shades of Grey</i>.

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:32.665
What are you saying?

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:36.217
Weren't you talking about

00:06:36.272 --> 00:06:38.552
domination and sexually powerful
positions?

00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:40.409
I suggest that from the very beginning,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.900
show her who's boss in bed.
Shut her up right there.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.339
I'm not talking about my sex life.
It's general compatibility...

00:06:48.454 --> 00:06:49.454
You're so dumb!

00:06:50.414 --> 00:06:51.019
Oh!

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.249
Your sex life was sorted?

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:56.469
My sex life?

00:06:56.604 --> 00:06:59.496
I'm your elder brother, you fool.
She's your sister-in-law.

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:01.587
Was.

00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:04.592
Was my sister-in-law.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.805
I've accepted it. You should do the same.

00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:09.400
Baba,

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.456
You drink.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:15.415
Be right back.

00:07:17.577 --> 00:07:19.053
Compatibility...

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:21.491
is a bitch.

00:07:22.747 --> 00:07:25.359
Love and stuff is still simple

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:27.588
But just that tuning...

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.491
That's important.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.328
Because if you want two
different things in life,

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:34.084
It never works.

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:36.050
Compatibility

00:07:36.313 --> 00:07:37.748
It all comes down to that.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.129
What should I do with him?

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.091
What do you mean?

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:54.282
Where should I take him
in this condition?

00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:57.669
He's your brother,
not some stray dog, bro.

00:07:58.042 --> 00:07:59.656
He came straight to you from America.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.104
What are you talking about?

00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:03.254
You obviously have to take him with you.

00:08:04.194 --> 00:08:06.225
Yeah, that was insensitive of me, no?

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:11.402
But I'm not used to the idea
of having a brother around.

00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:12.481
Yeah, but

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:14.529
your family stands
by you in times of crisis.

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:45.497
Where are we?

00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:48.105
A little before Navsari.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:50.037
Gujarat border, Baba.

00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:52.951
If you need booze then let's pick it up.
'Cause you won't find it ahead.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.230
-Gujarat border?
-Yup.

00:08:56.499 --> 00:08:57.625
Why?

00:08:58.452 --> 00:08:59.106
Road Trip.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.463
Don't blabber shit, Chitvan.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.219
Where are we going?

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:03.497
Jodhpur.

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.391
To Chanchal's.

00:09:06.042 --> 00:09:07.232
Chanchal's?

00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:08.176
Yup.

00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:09.169
Why?

00:09:10.422 --> 00:09:11.211
Baba.

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:13.954
'Cause only your family stands
by you in times of crisis.

00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:15.709
That's why I came to you.

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.079
But my life is fucked.

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:19.918
I can't take care of myself.
How will I manage you?

00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:23.171
It's best that you stay with Chanchal.

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:26.261
But I don't want to go
to her place right now.

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:29.289
I thought I'll stay with
you for some time before

00:09:29.377 --> 00:09:31.195
going to Manali to meet mom and dad.

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:33.449
Why would I stay at my
sister's in-laws' place?

00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:34.930
Nonsense, man!

00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:38.455
Why didn't you take me to your place?

00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:42.391
I did.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.844
Things went south there.

00:09:45.027 --> 00:09:46.559
You were drunk.

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:50.845
I, somehow, put you in the car
all by myself and

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.357
put you to sleep.

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:56.194
There was suddenly a knock on the door

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:58.461
and I saw some people there for extortion

00:09:58.702 --> 00:10:00.202
Loan sharks.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.184
To collect the last six months'
installments for your car.

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:05.055
Will they take my car just
because five or six cheques bounced?

00:10:05.758 --> 00:10:07.158
You should disappear.

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:11.961
I'll have to leave Bombay.

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:13.463
It's best to cross the border.

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:15.087
Pakistan!

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:17.358
Maharashtra border, fool.

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:20.194
So I decided to take you to Chanchal.

00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:24.670
So you're on the run?

00:10:27.131 --> 00:10:28.075
What, Baba?

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:30.821
You make it sound like I'm on the run
with someone else's car.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:33.618
Don't you have any money at all?

00:10:34.273 --> 00:10:35.273
I have little.

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:38.574
I'll pay the rest.

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:41.446
You have a lot of money, is it?

00:10:41.668 --> 00:10:42.668
Yeah, I have a lot.

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:44.898
Got it in my divorce settlement.

00:10:47.224 --> 00:10:49.088
She was culpable for the affair
so I got the money.

00:10:49.787 --> 00:10:50.592
Oh, man.

00:10:51.303 --> 00:10:52.306
You should have told me earlier.

00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:54.804
I paid for your alcohol last night.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.520
We're not discussing my problems here.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.625
We're trying to clear
the mess in your life.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.002
Let's go to Bombay
and solve your problem.

00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:06.455
I'll handle my issues
once I've dealt with you.

00:11:06.694 --> 00:11:09.105
Don't worry about me, boss.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.241
I can handle my issues.

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.090
All right.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.711
We'll reach Baroda in three hours.
Take a flight from there.

00:11:14.027 --> 00:11:15.027
Cool. Let's go.

00:11:15.052 --> 00:11:16.052
Yeah.

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:18.232
-Give me the keys.
-Why?

00:11:18.353 --> 00:11:19.978
You're having herbs
instead of tea early in the morning.

00:11:20.003 --> 00:11:20.803
Don't know where you'll take us.

00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:46.630
What are you doing in life?

00:11:47.384 --> 00:11:48.217
What do you mean?

00:11:48.329 --> 00:11:49.768
What's the plan?

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:53.672
Ran away from parents' place to become
a DJ and no one listens to your songs.

00:11:54.356 --> 00:11:57.149
You ran away from your own home
like a thief because of money.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:59.578
Baba, don't ruin my high by lecturing me.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.674
Right.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.487
Always stay high.

00:12:03.734 --> 00:12:05.312
Live life from one moment to the next.

00:12:05.911 --> 00:12:08.570
There's no focus; you don't
have any plans for your life.

00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:13.588
Baba, you had a plan, right?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.523
Going well?

00:12:20.694 --> 00:12:22.281
No, you're  right.

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:23.576
My plans failed.

00:12:24.297 --> 00:12:25.582
My fucking marriage has failed!

00:12:25.671 --> 00:12:27.470
I'm jobless, homeless.

00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:29.996
Thanks.

00:12:34.815 --> 00:12:36.307
There's one plan.

00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:38.109
What?

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:39.792
Breakfast.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:43.393
There's a mind blowing place
to eat a little ahead.

00:13:04.892 --> 00:13:05.695
Excuse me.

00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:10.236
Could you please check on the internet
and tell me how far Bharuch is?

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:11.282
Yeah, sure.

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:12.965
The connection is a little weak here.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.176
Where are you going though?

00:13:15.201 --> 00:13:16.201
Baroda.

00:13:16.257 --> 00:13:17.336
That'll also do.

00:13:22.924 --> 00:13:25.694
Don't you feel hot in this suit?

00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:28.074
Yeah, it gets hot but,

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.545
I'm habitual now.

00:13:29.614 --> 00:13:31.985
Do you have any other bad habits?

00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:37.274
You should ask someone
inside about Bharuch.

00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:38.621
That'd be better.

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.698
At the reception...

00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:54.552
What was that?

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:56.672
She was hitting on you.

00:13:56.832 --> 00:13:58.404
Exactly, but why?

00:13:58.868 --> 00:14:00.272
Why so modest?

00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:02.259
You're beautiful, Baba.

00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:05.476
And women can smell broken marriages
and money quicker than a dog.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:07.805
Let's go?

00:14:09.947 --> 00:14:11.481
Got your flight booked?

00:14:11.804 --> 00:14:14.192
No, due to all this...

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:16.098
Dad was asking.

00:14:16.701 --> 00:14:18.081
You told Dad?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.650
Yeah, I had to discuss plans for Jodhpur.

00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:22.835
You told them about Jodhpur also?

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:24.799
I couldn't take such a big decision alone.

00:14:24.824 --> 00:14:26.157
Texted Chanchal too.

00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:28.371
Come on, man.

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.836
You should have told me once.

00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:33.208
Now she'll feel bad if we don't go.

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:35.922
No one's gonna feel bad.

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:38.591
Everyone is busy in their lives.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.940
Call Chanchal up.

00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:55.426
Greetings, sir.

00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:58.085
Yes, sir. Sure, sir.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.603
She can't come to the phone.

00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:05.681
Because she's busy with the
celebrations for tomorrow

00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:08.645
Chanchal's gonna be a mother.

00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:16.948
Chanchal's pregnant?

00:15:17.201 --> 00:15:19.486
I'm gonna be a Chacha(uncle)!

00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:21.027
How will you be a Chacha?
It's your sister's child.

00:15:21.147 --> 00:15:22.856
You'll be a Maama(uncle).

00:15:25.613 --> 00:15:27.020
Fuck man!

00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:30.274
Chacha sounds so much better.

00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:33.261
You took away this also from me!
Fuck you!

00:15:34.156 --> 00:15:36.500
A semi-foreigner white kid would
have called me

00:15:36.587 --> 00:15:38.442
Chachu...Chachu...

00:15:38.609 --> 00:15:39.910
Fuck you.

00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:43.125
I think we should go to Jodhpur.

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:45.399
That's exactly what I've been saying.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.607
<i>I always wanted to be like my dad.</i>

00:15:58.225 --> 00:15:59.312
<i>But.</i>

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:02.419
<i>Life made me a Maama today.</i>

00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:06.523
<i>Dad...</i>

00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:08.563
<i>Used to plan everything.</i>

00:16:09.063 --> 00:16:10.395
<i>Sleeping on time,</i>

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.674
<i>waking up on time,</i>

00:16:11.717 --> 00:16:13.518
<i>eating on time.</i>

00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:18.267
<i>He'd decide Sunday's menu on Friday.</i>

00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:21.017
<i>I also did the same.</i>

00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:26.182
<i>But the one thing my dad wouldn't plan,</i>

00:16:26.223 --> 00:16:28.456
<i>were his road trips.</i>

00:16:29.087 --> 00:16:33.880
<i>Every year, we used to go
on road trips as a family holiday.</i>

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:35.468
<i>Always unplanned.</i>

00:16:36.119 --> 00:16:38.107
<i>No hotel bookings, no maps...</i>

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.147
<i>Just packed our bags and left.</i>

00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:46.193
<i>Kashmir some time,</i>

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.431
<i>some time it was Sikkim</i>

00:16:47.495 --> 00:16:49.503
or Kerala or Rajasthan.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.796
Chitvan...

00:16:54.642 --> 00:16:57.179
Is like Dad when it comes to road trips.

00:16:58.662 --> 00:17:00.662
Which I could never understand.

00:17:10.268 --> 00:17:12.053
Even you don't know!

00:17:12.245 --> 00:17:13.733
That's a surprise.

00:17:13.938 --> 00:17:16.390
Yeah, I'll call you once
I know the entire thing.

00:17:17.192 --> 00:17:18.192
Okay, bye.

00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:21.223
Dad also doesn't know.

00:17:22.664 --> 00:17:25.632
Might not have told everyone
because of it being too soon.

00:17:26.743 --> 00:17:28.273
There's a party for pregnancy,

00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:30.967
Not that big a secret, surely.

00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:33.621
Let's go?

00:17:38.455 --> 00:17:40.236
Chanchal turned to be really smart.

00:17:40.575 --> 00:17:42.531
Her life is set.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:58.253
I don't understand
the need to do all this.

00:17:58.669 --> 00:18:01.319
Is it necessary to celebrate
every other thing?

00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:02.967
It's a not just anything.

00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:06.606
Bhabhi, these are delicate matters.
It's difficult to say anything.

00:18:06.715 --> 00:18:09.016
You never know...

00:18:11.913 --> 00:18:12.907
Chandan!

00:18:13.132 --> 00:18:14.132
Chanchal.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.257
Chitvan.

00:18:15.377 --> 00:18:16.377
Elephant.

00:18:22.804 --> 00:18:24.915
You look shocked. But didn't
he send you a message?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:25.471
When?

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:26.334
This morning.

00:18:26.376 --> 00:18:27.443
On which number?

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:28.931
9872534...

00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:29.731
Chitvan,

00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:31.362
That's not my number.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:37.294
I sent it to Chanchal Chabra again.
Fuck!

00:18:38.023 --> 00:18:40.137
You didn't tell us that you were pregnant.

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:42.118
How do you know?

00:18:42.214 --> 00:18:43.642
Why are you here?

00:18:43.834 --> 00:18:45.378
Baba was taking a break
after his divorce.

00:18:45.588 --> 00:18:46.655
Came to my club
while I was peeing...

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:48.633
You never told me that
you got a divorce.

00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:50.497
I didn't even know about the marriage.

00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:55.106
What? Told you while we were peeing...

00:18:55.931 --> 00:18:58.783
Bhabhi, you go ahead.
I'll be there in a couple of minutes.

00:19:00.399 --> 00:19:01.812
Namaste.

00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:07.075
-You didn't even tell mom and dad?
-No no no...

00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:09.044
And you also don't tell them, please?

00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:10.336
Oh.

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:11.875
What?

00:19:12.035 --> 00:19:13.035
Chitvan.

00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:13.788
Chitvan.

00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:14.837
Camel!

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.365
He's already told them.

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:26.709
About my divorce, your pregnancy

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.322
He can't keep anything in his stomach.

00:19:28.482 --> 00:19:30.525
Baba, communication is really important.

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:32.816
Don't you see how
dysfunctional have we become?

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.752
No, no, no, no...
Fuck!

00:19:34.857 --> 00:19:35.903
This is a mess!

00:19:36.414 --> 00:19:37.403
What happened?

00:19:38.082 --> 00:19:39.606
I'm not actually pregnant.

00:19:40.582 --> 00:19:41.725
What the fuck?

00:19:41.988 --> 00:19:44.205
What is all this? These flowers?
All this decoration?

00:19:44.274 --> 00:19:47.557
I just told it to shut these people up.
It was a small lie.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.644
Pranav went and told everybody.

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.147
Now, what?
