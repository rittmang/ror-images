WEBVTT

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:13.595
Chanchu.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:14.720
Get up.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.262
We have arrived at the
address that you gave me.

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:18.095
Guys.

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:18.970
Come on.

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:20.053
We have arrived in Lucknow.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.637
Were we followed?

00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:32.262
Crap!

00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:34.678
The Police have taken
brother Hari for questioning.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.553
Who? - Brother Hari.

00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:38.928
My secretary.

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:41.053
I have a secretary.
- Crap!

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:42.345
Can we trust him?

00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:44.387
Will he be able to endure
torture techniques of the Police?

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.970
Why will they torture him?
They have taken him for questioning.

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:48.428
In any case he doesn't know anything.

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:51.137
Tunde Kebabs.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.595
Those are famous, aren't they?
Can we have some?

00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:54.762
Please, Chits.

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:56.137
We haven't brushed as yet.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:57.470
Don't talk about eating.

00:01:58.178 --> 00:02:01.012
Chanchu, we are getting good food to eat,
you should eat.

00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:04.303
In jail you will have to have
dry bread and diluted lentil soup.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.095
And custard on Sunday.

00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:07.887
But if you're only with me.

00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:09.262
Nobody is going to jail!

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:11.095
We have come looking for Pranav.

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.178
Once he's found this
whole matter will be settled.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:17.053
Hello.

00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:19.512
Yeah.

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:23.303
Cast whoever you want to.
Why are you asking me?

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:24.803
Yes.

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:25.887
Take Chandrachur Singh.

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:26.803
He's good.

00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:27.428
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:28.053
He's a man of good lineage.

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.012
Suits the part.

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:30.595
"The girl winks.."

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:31.970
Yes, yes.
Do it.

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:33.345
Make a remake of that song.

00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:34.303
Good.

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:36.137
Oh, for..!

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:37.803
Don't call me.
I'm not in town.

00:02:38.553 --> 00:02:39.512
Bye.

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:42.845
They're taking Chandrachur
Singh for Pranav's role.

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:44.137
Brother, you can't do this.

00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:45.137
Please stop this film.

00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:47.637
Chanchal, this is not
a ladies musical program..

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.012
..that I can stop
just by yelling at them.

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:50.803
There's millions riding on it.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.303
It's serious business.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:55.470
Chanchu, don't get jealous of my success.

00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:57.762
That big star is performing my role.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:58.595
What is his name, Baba?

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.762
Okay, can we please stop
talking about this f****** film?

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:02.637
You started it.
- I..

00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:04.762
Can we do what we came here to do?

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.345
Where is this place?
Where will we find that uncle?

00:03:08.303 --> 00:03:09.095
Khurshid Manzil.

00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:13.012
This is the area but let's
ask someone the exact directions.

00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:17.012
What if this uncle is
conniving with your in-laws?

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:19.012
No. He's not actually
a part of the family.

00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:21.387
He is Pranav's father's friend.

00:03:21.512 --> 00:03:23.012
In fact he's closer to Pranav.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.356
Pranav thinks of him as his "Guru"

00:03:25.557 --> 00:03:26.335
Makes sense.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
 Pranav must be here.

00:03:27.678 --> 00:03:29.220
He must be asleep with
his head in that chap's lap.

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:31.095
That's it.
We found brother-in-law.

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:36.887
Have you completely
stopped using your brain?

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:43.262
Sometimes I feel you two don't even
know why you get irritated with me.

00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:46.470
You guys lord over me just
because you are born before me.

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:48.553
I'm making sense, guys.

00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:51.303
I always make sense.
- Stop the car up ahead.

00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:51.928
Nonsense.

00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:54.637
Let's ask someone the address.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:57.178
Him?
- Stop at the side.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:57.928
Let's ask him.
- Yes.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.303
Stop at the left.

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.637
He seems fine to me.
- Will you stop?

00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:03.887
Brother.
- Excuse me.

00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:04.387
Excuse me.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.012
Brother.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.012
Where is Khurshid Manzil?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.637
Do you wish to verbalize
with Prince Alexander?

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:10.178
Excuse me?

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:12.637
Verbalize? Pranav said the same thing.

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:13.470
We are at the right place.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:14.512
Yes, yes.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:15.553
Who is verba..

00:04:15.887 --> 00:04:17.220
Prince Alexander?
- I'll explain.

00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:18.053
Yes, yes.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:19.428
We wish to meet him.

00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:21.678
Do you see that building?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.470
Yes.
- There is a big tree behind it.

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:27.470
You will find him under the tree.

00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:29.595
Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.095
Verbalize.
- His name is not verbalize.

00:04:32.387 --> 00:04:33.220
Let's go.

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:24.928
Deal those.

00:05:30.678 --> 00:05:33.137
Baba, which one of those
four do you think is Prince?

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:39.887
That green cucumber is Prince?

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.845
Actually his name is
Nawab Sikandar Khan.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.220
His father lovingly
called him Alexander..

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.803
..so he chose to be
called by that name.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.178
Prince?
- Yeah.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.803
He addresses himself as Prince Alexander.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.012
And everyone who visits
him is also a prince.

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:57.137
He spends 200 rupees on a horse carriage..

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.762
..to collect a pension of 150 rupees.

00:05:59.012 --> 00:05:59.762
Every month.

00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:01.720
Basically he's crazy.

00:06:04.678 --> 00:06:05.803
Five paisa blind.

00:06:16.678 --> 00:06:17.428
Show me your cards.

00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:20.345
Show me your cards.
Don't be shy.

00:06:34.803 --> 00:06:35.470
Show.

00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:43.345
You have very unfortunate cards.

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:44.720
Wow!

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:47.220
This green chap looks very fertile to me.

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:51.095
Look.

00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:54.928
Fold the sheet.

00:06:57.095 --> 00:06:57.803
Easy. Easy

00:06:58.095 --> 00:06:58.387
Easy.

00:06:58.637 --> 00:06:59.262
Give me.

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:00.470
Yes.

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:03.470
I'm going.

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:08.595
Nawab.
- Yes.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.012
Give me my sheet before you leave.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.012
You are a very shameless person.

00:07:16.553 --> 00:07:17.720
Pick it up at the mansion.

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:30.762
Oh!
- What a star!

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:34.387
Well, goodbye.

00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:36.262
Chitwan, follow him.

00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:41.178
Prince, we are coming.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.053
Do all of Pranav's acquaintances clap?

00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:35.428
I like him.

00:08:44.137 --> 00:08:46.762
He has made a statue
of his own like Rocky Balboa.

00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:47.887
He's gone inside.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.928
I will make one
of mine, Baba.

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:50.137
Outside the society.

00:09:23.762 --> 00:09:24.845
Is this Pranav's car?

00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:35.928
With whom is he dancing?
- With himself.

00:09:38.803 --> 00:09:39.553
Prince Alexander.

00:09:42.803 --> 00:09:43.553
Prince Alexander.

00:09:43.803 --> 00:09:45.178
Chanchal.
From the back.

00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:48.178
I have told you several times
I don't want a cable connection.

00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:50.345
Please leave.
- No, no.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.262
I am Chanchal.
Pranav's wife.

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:55.553
What?

00:09:57.178 --> 00:09:58.137
One moment.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.470
What did you say?
- My name is Chanchal.

00:10:11.637 --> 00:10:12.845
I am Pranav's wife.

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.470
Princess Chanchal?

00:10:17.678 --> 00:10:18.387
Greetings.

00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:20.262
Honored.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.387
Please come in.

00:10:23.137 --> 00:10:24.137
Come. Come.

00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:27.137
Tell your employees
to wait in the balcony.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.845
No, No.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.095
they are my brothers.
Chandan and Chitwan.

00:10:30.512 --> 00:10:31.053
I am Chandan.

00:10:31.178 --> 00:10:33.178
This is Chitwan and she is Chanchal.

00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:35.387
Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:38.220
You are welcome too.

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.095
Please take a load off.
- From where?

00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:42.595
He is asking us to sit.

00:11:03.053 --> 00:11:05.387
The rooms are big and so are the gardens.

00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:40.803
Please take a load off.

00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:45.387
Is this..?
- We shall see.

00:11:48.053 --> 00:11:48.803
Easy. Easy.

00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:49.720
Sit. Sit.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.095
Great! Great!

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:54.053
It's good.

00:11:56.262 --> 00:11:59.470
So, Prince Chaman and Prince Champak.

00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:01.720
Grab a chair.
- No.

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.887
Just sit.

00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:08.678
Princess Chanchal.

00:12:10.303 --> 00:12:11.803
What brings you to Lucknow?

00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:15.053
You've come alone? I don't see Pranav.

00:12:15.887 --> 00:12:17.637
We thought he..
- Brother-in-law is missing.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.512
Chanchu thought he would be here.

00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:21.012
So we came here looking for him.

00:12:21.637 --> 00:12:23.137
What? What is missing?
- Brother-in-law.

00:12:23.387 --> 00:12:25.012
Pranav is missing.
- He is not to be found.

00:12:25.137 --> 00:12:26.762
Meaning..
- Meaning..

00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:30.345
Did you wish to see me, Prince?
- No.

00:12:31.762 --> 00:12:32.220
No, no.

00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:33.137
Yes.

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:35.512
What are you doing, Chilla? Look.

00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:39.595
My fingers have swollen from
clapping and you wouldn't listen.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.678
Are you deaf?

00:12:41.137 --> 00:12:42.678
I was repairing the dining table.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.178
The leg is broken.

00:12:45.637 --> 00:12:49.470
Due to the sound of
hammering I did not hear you.

00:12:50.012 --> 00:12:50.762
Okay.

00:12:52.012 --> 00:12:53.387
This delegation has
arrived from Rajasthan.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.762
Bring some squash for them.

00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:58.220
I am talking to you
and you are walking away.

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.595
Get this chair fixed.

00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:02.553
Madam would have broken
her hips just now.

00:13:03.137 --> 00:13:04.137
I hope you heard me, Chilla.

00:13:04.387 --> 00:13:06.012
Three glasses of squash.

00:13:06.845 --> 00:13:08.928
The help these days acts very pricey.

00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:11.512
He is a..

00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:15.637
..top class..

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:18.970
He has a fantastic voice.

00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:20.387
Wonderful voice.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.970
Mr. Naushad wanted to
take him to Mumbai.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:23.970
He didn't go.

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.387
He was young.

00:13:29.553 --> 00:13:31.428
Where were we?
- Brother-in-law is lost.

00:13:33.053 --> 00:13:34.762
He's not a bunch of
keys that one can lose.

00:13:35.095 --> 00:13:36.720
He is a strapping young man.

00:13:37.012 --> 00:13:37.762
How can he get lost?

00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:41.053
Actually the elections..
- Baba messed up.

00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:43.137
In the book he wrote the problem.
- Just shut up.

00:13:43.387 --> 00:13:44.137
Don't do this.

00:13:44.428 --> 00:13:47.803
What kind of a man are you?
I am talking to her..

00:13:48.137 --> 00:13:50.137
..and you keep intervening
time and again.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.845
Go out of here!
Get lost!

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:54.095
I was telling you that
Baba wrote in the book..

00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:55.095
Shut up!

00:13:55.595 --> 00:13:56.303
Get out!

00:13:57.803 --> 00:14:00.220
What have I done?
- Both of you go.

00:14:00.303 --> 00:14:01.262
Go and play outside.

00:14:01.595 --> 00:14:03.012
Let's go.
He knows the story.

00:14:03.262 --> 00:14:04.178
Let's go and play.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.000
Are they really your brothers?

00:14:27.338 --> 00:14:28.978
What are you doing?

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:31.470
These are antique items.

00:14:31.553 --> 00:14:32.637
They will break.

00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:35.762
It hasn't been played for a long time.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.303
Interesting sub-plot idea.

00:14:49.012 --> 00:14:50.387
The Prince that time forgot.

00:14:52.137 --> 00:14:56.137
In an ancient heritage structure
in Lucknow lives a Nawab..

00:14:56.845 --> 00:14:58.762
..who's clearly full of himself.

00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:03.387
Nawab Sikandar Khan
alias Prince Alexander.

00:15:04.387 --> 00:15:05.303
Wow!

00:15:05.762 --> 00:15:06.803
What a guy!

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.220
He looks more ruined
than the ruins he resides in.

00:15:10.803 --> 00:15:13.970
This must have been a beautiful
structure at some point of time.

00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:15.970
Amazing artifacts.

00:15:16.178 --> 00:15:17.970
Antique pieces all around.

00:15:18.553 --> 00:15:19.970
And a ghost.

00:15:23.387 --> 00:15:24.595
I am not a thief.

00:15:25.053 --> 00:15:26.053
I was looking around the house.

00:15:26.262 --> 00:15:28.053
You are Chandan Sharma.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.887
I have read your book.

00:15:35.678 --> 00:15:36.970
I don't know what to say.

00:15:37.428 --> 00:15:38.928
A writer at a loss of words.

00:15:39.803 --> 00:15:40.887
Wow!

00:15:41.803 --> 00:15:43.303
Your name?
- Zainab.

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:45.345
Beautiful.

00:15:45.637 --> 00:15:49.137
Excuse me?
- You are Prince Alexander's..

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:50.428
His wife.

00:15:51.887 --> 00:15:52.762
Oh!

00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:55.262
I thought..
- That happens often.

00:15:55.803 --> 00:15:58.553
Incidentally, congratulations.
A film is being made on your book.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.137
Yes.
That is happening too.

00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:01.137
Never mind that.

00:16:01.345 --> 00:16:02.762
Let's discuss something else.

00:16:03.387 --> 00:16:04.803
What would you like to discuss?

00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:08.220
How old is this building?

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:10.845
About 250 years old..

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.303
..and the Prince is 70 years old.

00:16:13.803 --> 00:16:15.178
He is 42 years older than me.

00:16:16.137 --> 00:16:17.220
Isn't that what you wanted to ask me?

00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:20.845
Talking to you is..
- Pointless.

00:16:22.387 --> 00:16:23.470
Difficult.

00:16:24.303 --> 00:16:24.553
Come with me.

00:16:24.637 --> 00:16:26.137
I'll show you the house.
- House?

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.762
You said you aren't a thief.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.512
You were looking at the house.
- Yes.

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:32.220
I was looking at the house.
- Yes.

00:16:33.512 --> 00:16:34.428
Shall we?
- Let's go.

00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:49.887
Little Prince.
- What's up, bro?

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.512
Squash.

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:56.345
It chills the throat.
- No, no.

00:16:56.512 --> 00:16:57.262
Thanks.

00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:01.762
Syrup.

00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:04.137
This chills the soul.

00:17:05.512 --> 00:17:08.470
And I am Chilla.
- No.

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:10.053
Been there done that.

00:17:11.762 --> 00:17:12.720
I am Chitwan.

00:17:13.262 --> 00:17:14.137
Pranav is my brother-in-law.

00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:15.845
Very nice.

00:17:17.178 --> 00:17:18.595
Two drops of life.

00:17:19.345 --> 00:17:20.387
It will be fun.

00:17:20.512 --> 00:17:24.345
You're Chilla, bro, but no.

00:17:25.053 --> 00:17:26.678
I have strong willpower.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:34.553
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:38.845
Dead body?

00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:41.637
What? What are you saying?

00:17:42.012 --> 00:17:44.553
Will? - What kind of
questions are you asking me?

00:17:44.887 --> 00:17:46.345
I am positive Pranav is alive.

00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:49.095
Princess, you can't trust death.

00:17:49.595 --> 00:17:50.803
It can show up anywhere.

00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:54.220
I have come seeking your help
and you are saying these negative things.

00:17:54.595 --> 00:17:55.720
I see.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.220
Apparently you don't like philosophy.

00:17:59.928 --> 00:18:00.470
No problem.

00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:02.345
Let's go to the terrace.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.928
You will be able to see sights from afar.

00:18:05.303 --> 00:18:07.012
Let's start our search over there.

00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:08.887
Come.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.220
There is no dead body
and there is no will.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.928
So..

00:18:18.762 --> 00:18:21.262
And this is the Nawab's favorite room.

00:18:23.095 --> 00:18:24.262
Wow!

00:18:25.512 --> 00:18:27.262
This room is like a museum.

00:18:29.012 --> 00:18:32.803
Does the Nawab have a carpet business?
- He's fond of them.

00:18:33.262 --> 00:18:34.428
It is his ancestral property.

00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:36.512
His father and grandfather
used to collect them.

00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:39.678
They must be very expensive.
- Yes.

00:18:39.928 --> 00:18:42.012
That African carpet that you see.

00:18:42.262 --> 00:18:43.387
It is 300 years old.

00:18:43.845 --> 00:18:46.387
Some British came
last week to offer money.

00:18:47.637 --> 00:18:49.512
They wanted to pay 70 lakhs for it.

00:18:50.137 --> 00:18:51.095
Well?
- Well, what?

00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:53.220
The Nawab doesn't want to sell it.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.928
It is his pride.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.387
He says, "I will burn
down the whole room..

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.345
..but I refuse to sell even one carpet."

00:19:02.845 --> 00:19:03.845
What?

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.980
I'm sorry but I don't know
if the Nawab's principles are rigid..

00:19:09.005 --> 00:19:09.712
..or if he is out of his mind.

00:19:10.768 --> 00:19:12.466
To each his own.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.800
Both, the Nawab and his
views are very interesting.

00:19:17.262 --> 00:19:20.595
Of course.
- On the other hand is your view..

00:19:20.762 --> 00:19:23.220
..which is world famous now.
- No.

00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:25.887
It will be.

00:19:27.178 --> 00:19:30.512
After your film.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

00:19:32.178 --> 00:19:33.970
You have written about
a very beautiful world.

00:19:36.178 --> 00:19:39.887
Within the four walls of this
building I took that road trip with you.

00:19:40.887 --> 00:19:43.595
I liked it.
- Thank you.

00:19:51.137 --> 00:19:55.178
You want to go to the terrace?
- Sure.

00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:57.595
Let's go.

00:19:59.512 --> 00:20:03.137
All the others too will be upstairs.
- Yes.

00:20:03.387 --> 00:20:04.387
Exactly.

00:20:14.178 --> 00:20:15.428
That was fantastic, brother.

00:20:15.928 --> 00:20:17.553
Best two drops of my life.

00:20:18.512 --> 00:20:21.095
Chill.
- Chill.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.678
Chilla.
- Yes.

00:20:28.803 --> 00:20:29.928
How are things?

00:20:31.887 --> 00:20:33.262
I don't see Jumman.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.928
Jumman has gone to Indore to
run an errand for Mr. Shaukat.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.470
Yes.

00:20:38.845 --> 00:20:40.095
That's right.
That's right.

00:20:41.928 --> 00:20:44.303
Where is Mr. Timothy?
- He has gone to Kanpur.

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:45.470
He took money with him.

00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:46.928
He flew off one hour ago.

00:20:47.262 --> 00:20:48.220
He'll be back by night.

00:20:48.553 --> 00:20:50.303
Right. Right. Right.

00:20:51.095 --> 00:20:51.303
Okay.

00:20:51.553 --> 00:20:54.137
Then let's send Mehbooba.
- No, let her be.

00:20:54.428 --> 00:20:56.012
She got hurt with a string.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.387
Did you apply turmeric on her?
- I have to apply turmeric.

00:20:59.262 --> 00:21:00.137
Apply it.
Apply turmeric.

00:21:00.303 --> 00:21:01.137
Then..

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:04.553
Mr. Salman.

00:21:05.387 --> 00:21:06.720
Our friends are here.

00:21:07.095 --> 00:21:10.345
So, you must fly for them.

00:21:10.887 --> 00:21:14.220
Jumman and Timothy..?
- They are pigeons.

00:21:15.803 --> 00:21:18.345
What if they fly off and don't return?
- They are police informants.

00:21:18.803 --> 00:21:19.678
They are very sensible.

00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:22.012
They carry letters.
They carry money.

00:21:22.262 --> 00:21:23.428
They bring digestives.

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:24.595
Anything you tell them to do.

00:21:25.428 --> 00:21:28.512
One might say they are
Khurshid Manzil's internet.

00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:31.595
Do they score as well?

00:21:32.137 --> 00:21:33.178
Near Imam Bada.

00:21:33.845 --> 00:21:35.387
Keep going straight ahead from there.

00:21:37.137 --> 00:21:38.428
So, go now.

00:21:40.553 --> 00:21:41.720
Right.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:45.845
Look.

00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:47.387
Didn't I tell you..
- Zainab.

00:21:48.095 --> 00:21:49.428
Come. Come. Come. Come.

00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:51.012
Let me introduce you to her.

00:21:52.303 --> 00:21:54.803
This is Mr. Pranav's princess.

00:21:55.387 --> 00:21:57.303
And she is mine.

00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:00.803
Let's have a party.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.095
Excuse me?
- Do not worry.

00:22:03.303 --> 00:22:04.803
We will get news of Mr.
Pranav by morning.

00:22:05.387 --> 00:22:07.012
Salman is very good.

00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:10.053
Once he makes a commitment,
consider it done.

00:22:11.637 --> 00:22:13.553
His color is also amazing!

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.928
He was entirely white before.
Then he got some flecks.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.553
Looks like M.F. Hussain has made
a painting on him.

00:22:24.345 --> 00:22:27.553
What? How will Pranav be found?
- That bird has gone to find out.

00:22:28.303 --> 00:22:30.553
What bird?
- 'Maine pyar kiya.'

00:22:31.262 --> 00:22:32.595
'Kabutar ja, ja, ja.'

00:22:34.178 --> 00:22:34.970
Chitwan, are you high?

00:22:39.553 --> 00:22:41.595
No value for such a genuine person.

00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:43.970
Damn it!

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.595
Wow!

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.428
Prince..?
- Chandan.

00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:07.387
Chandan.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.178
You look very handsome.
- Thank you.

00:23:10.262 --> 00:23:11.053
Wonderful!

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.678
Have a seat.
- Yes. Yes.

00:23:18.053 --> 00:23:19.970
You want to make love to grapes?

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.887
Excuse me?
- Wine.

00:23:27.303 --> 00:23:28.095
He wants to know if you'd like some wine.

00:23:28.512 --> 00:23:29.137
Yes, yes.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:29.803
A little.

00:23:30.053 --> 00:23:30.803
Give me thirty rupees.

00:23:39.595 --> 00:23:42.720
Sorry, I left my purse in my room.
- No issue.

00:23:43.012 --> 00:23:46.387
Chilla, put it on his account.
- Yes.

00:23:46.678 --> 00:23:49.803
So, meat is being cooked for you all.

00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:52.928
And it has been paid by Prince..
- Chitwan.

00:23:53.178 --> 00:23:54.262
Chitwan.

00:23:55.345 --> 00:23:58.845
And spinach soup is being cooked for me.

00:23:59.387 --> 00:24:01.345
Are you vegetarian?
- Alas!

00:24:02.678 --> 00:24:05.137
You reminded me of Mr. Khayami.

00:24:05.428 --> 00:24:05.803
I see.

00:24:05.887 --> 00:24:07.345
He is vegetarian.
- No.

00:24:08.178 --> 00:24:10.137
His poem is vegetarian.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.095
As he stated.
- Pleasure.

00:24:15.428 --> 00:24:17.428
It has been one month.

00:24:18.178 --> 00:24:21.637
It has been one month since
mutton has been forbidden.

00:24:22.303 --> 00:24:25.637
It has been one month since
mutton has been forbidden.

00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:30.387
I have been eating lady
fingers and chats at parties.

00:24:30.512 --> 00:24:31.678
Wonderful!

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:33.137
After eating taro.

00:24:34.387 --> 00:24:35.595
You know what taro is?

00:24:36.845 --> 00:24:38.303
Take a look in the mirror.

00:24:39.012 --> 00:24:44.053
After eating taro why
hurt the rhyme of poetry.

00:24:44.553 --> 00:24:47.928
It delicately turned
into a spinach leaf.

00:24:48.262 --> 00:24:49.053
That's not bad!

00:24:49.303 --> 00:24:50.470
Wonderful!
Wonderful!

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:52.053
No!

00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:55.512
You don't clap for poetry.
You pay compliments.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.345
You are supposed to
say "That was wonderful."

00:24:58.345 --> 00:24:59.012
Forget it.

00:24:59.845 --> 00:25:01.595
Chilla, bring my soup.

00:25:02.637 --> 00:25:04.137
And send their food to their room.

00:25:04.387 --> 00:25:05.387
Go away!

00:25:05.678 --> 00:25:07.053
Let's eat together.

00:25:07.262 --> 00:25:09.137
Such foolish behavior!
- They are guests.

00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:10.137
Forgive them.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.637
I've paid for it.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.845
You have a very big heart.
- Come on

00:25:31.095 --> 00:25:35.512
Why can't our family be normal?
- Because normal is boring.

00:25:38.762 --> 00:25:40.178
Fido Dido says so.
Not me.

00:25:41.553 --> 00:25:44.887
Do you remember Fido Dido?
The one in the cold drink ad.

00:25:46.428 --> 00:25:48.178
He had four hairs.
You used to make sketches of him.

00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:53.970
You remember?
- Maybe boring is better.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.178
Whose family is normal?

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.512
Is this family normal?
Is Pranav's family normal?

00:26:00.428 --> 00:26:02.137
His sister-in-law is behind this scam,
isn't she?

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:05.803
As for normal and exciting,
when the three of us meet..

00:26:05.887 --> 00:26:07.137
..we do exciting things.

00:26:07.887 --> 00:26:09.178
Else life is boring anyways.

00:26:12.053 --> 00:26:14.762
I just wanted Pranav
and me to be normal.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.803
And for a while I thought we were.

00:26:19.553 --> 00:26:21.053
We made a new beginning.

00:26:21.137 --> 00:26:22.845
Everything was going well and then..

00:26:25.762 --> 00:26:28.178
..he just left.
- He'll be back.

00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:31.137
I really hope.
I really hope he's okay

00:26:31.803 --> 00:26:35.178
I imagine the worst..
- Don't think negative thoughts.

00:26:35.887 --> 00:26:37.303
We are looking for him, aren't we?
He will be found.

00:26:38.178 --> 00:26:40.220
Let's think of something else.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720
I have to tell you something.

00:26:42.803 --> 00:26:44.803
I'm really sorry about the book.
I didn't mean to.

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:45.553
Seriously.

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:47.928
But I can't stop the film.
- Not that.

00:26:49.762 --> 00:26:52.428
Then?
- Promise me you won't tell anyone.

00:26:52.803 --> 00:26:53.470
Baba.

00:26:53.595 --> 00:26:54.928
Chanchu.

00:26:56.803 --> 00:26:59.428
Chilla and
I were chilling on the terrace.

00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:02.428
Chill..

00:27:03.678 --> 00:27:04.428
We were smoking cannabis.

00:27:05.595 --> 00:27:06.137
Nice.

00:27:06.345 --> 00:27:09.012
What's nice?
- Sweet dumplings.

00:27:11.053 --> 00:27:12.303
Made of milk solids.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.053
Pranav is not lost.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.053
Chitwan.

00:27:16.637 --> 00:27:18.053
Are you..?
- Yes!

00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:19.095
Yes, I'm high, scumbag!

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:20.095
Damn it!

00:27:21.387 --> 00:27:23.845
But Baba, when I'm high I never lie.

00:27:24.387 --> 00:27:25.137
Pranav.

00:27:25.387 --> 00:27:26.137
He is in Kolkata.

00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:28.595
What nonsense is he speaking?

00:27:28.845 --> 00:27:31.970
Pranav. You forgot Pranav?
- I know who Pranav is!

00:27:32.262 --> 00:27:33.720
Yes.
He is in Kolkata.

00:27:33.845 --> 00:27:34.928
He is eating sweet dumplings.

00:27:35.012 --> 00:27:36.345
Chitwan, how do you know this?

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.970
Chilla and I were
sharing cannabis upstairs just now.

00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:46.595
I told him I share cars,
scooters and bikes too.

00:27:46.887 --> 00:27:49.970
One should share.
Sharing is cool!

00:27:51.262 --> 00:27:55.012
My drivezy is available if you
want to go anywhere. Book it. Easy.

00:27:55.553 --> 00:27:57.262
He got very high when he heard that
and said..

00:27:57.803 --> 00:28:01.012
I have a PhD.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.012
In Desserts.

00:28:04.345 --> 00:28:07.262
I know about the
best desserts of the country.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.012
I receive calls for desserts.

00:28:10.928 --> 00:28:13.387
I received a call from
Prince Pranav recently.

00:28:13.553 --> 00:28:14.595
Brother-in-law.

00:28:14.678 --> 00:28:19.012
He asked me where in Kolkata
one would find the best sweet dumplings.

00:28:19.428 --> 00:28:20.595
Good.

00:28:22.637 --> 00:28:23.720
Sweet dumplings.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.470
When did that happen?

00:28:28.928 --> 00:28:31.345
It happened 8-10 days ago.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.303
When I called back I learned he...

00:28:45.553 --> 00:28:49.428
...called from a handicap stall
at Tollygunge tram depot.

00:28:49.678 --> 00:28:50.012
Crap!

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:51.887
Let's go then.
- Hold on.

00:28:52.053 --> 00:28:54.512
You believe an unreliable
addict and that antique chap?

00:28:54.595 --> 00:28:57.678
Baba, I am not unreliable, okay.

00:28:58.387 --> 00:29:01.970
Anytime there is a problem
I only step up to the occasion..

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.012
..like a superhero.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.345
Read your book if you don't believe me.
- I've read it.

00:29:06.762 --> 00:29:09.220
I have written that book.
- Then let's go.

00:29:11.553 --> 00:29:12.803
What's the option?

00:29:14.053 --> 00:29:15.303
You want to wait for
the pigeon until morning?

00:29:17.345 --> 00:29:17.887
Okay.

00:29:18.262 --> 00:29:18.762
Point.

00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:21.678
Then let's and ride.

00:29:21.803 --> 00:29:22.512
You guys leave.

00:29:22.637 --> 00:29:24.303
I'll be there in five minutes.

00:29:24.678 --> 00:29:25.428
Baba?

00:29:26.678 --> 00:29:27.887
He needs to go to the
toilet at the wrong time.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.387
Let's go, Chitwan.
Start the car.

00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:30.387
Come.

00:29:33.303 --> 00:29:34.220
Hi.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.887
Is everything okay?
- Pranav is in Kolkata.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:40.470
Maybe.

00:29:40.595 --> 00:29:41.137
Oh!

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.720
That's good news.
- So we have to leave now.

00:29:45.637 --> 00:29:47.428
The Nawab must be resting now.

00:29:47.762 --> 00:29:48.428
Yes.

00:29:48.762 --> 00:29:50.053
I will inform him in the morning.

00:29:50.345 --> 00:29:51.303
You may go without worry.

00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:55.095
If you like I could return
after wrapping this up.

00:29:55.887 --> 00:29:58.345
You may return anytime you wish.

00:29:58.845 --> 00:29:59.887
You're most welcome here.

00:30:01.303 --> 00:30:02.303
To take you.

00:30:02.595 --> 00:30:03.428
Excuse me?

00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:06.428
You are here in this
shambles of a mansion.

00:30:06.887 --> 00:30:08.095
I'll come back for you.

00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:10.553
You want to rescue me?

00:30:11.095 --> 00:30:12.512
By helping me run from here?

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:17.887
Mr. Sharma, you have written
such an unconventional book.

00:30:18.512 --> 00:30:21.095
So, how did your outlook
become so cliché in reality?

00:30:21.428 --> 00:30:22.095
Pardon?

00:30:25.553 --> 00:30:27.178
I am extremely happy over here.

00:30:27.887 --> 00:30:32.137
And I truly love the Nawab infinitely.

00:30:35.637 --> 00:30:39.303
You're silent again?
- I'm really sorry.

00:30:39.428 --> 00:30:40.845
I assumed that..
- No. No.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.387
Please don't be sorry.

00:30:42.803 --> 00:30:46.053
It's very sweet and in fact
I'm flattered.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.137
But you're really happy here.

00:30:51.137 --> 00:30:52.262
With him.

00:30:55.512 --> 00:30:56.553
Tell me something.

00:30:57.053 --> 00:30:58.803
Have you ever wondered..

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:05.595
..why Pranav respects this
strange and weird Nawab so much?

00:31:07.053 --> 00:31:09.720
Four years ago he
sold one of his carpets..

00:31:10.345 --> 00:31:11.803
..and he did so happily.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.803
Do you know why?
- Why?

00:31:15.095 --> 00:31:18.845
Because he didn't want any
shortage for my post-graduation.

00:31:19.803 --> 00:31:21.220
Nothing less than Oxford
was acceptable to him.

00:31:21.553 --> 00:31:22.595
Oxford?

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.845
For a successful novelist..

00:31:25.178 --> 00:31:26.845
..it seems you judge
all the books by their covers.

00:31:27.095 --> 00:31:29.220
No, I'm sorry, I..
- Chandan.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.928
Yes. Coming.

00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:34.345
I will write to you.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.428
- Will you send it with a pigeon..

00:31:36.678 --> 00:31:38.428
..or shall I give you my email ID?

00:31:40.428 --> 00:31:42.345
I will write you in my next book.

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:43.970
I'm pleased to meet you.

00:31:46.637 --> 00:31:50.387
There seems to be disorder outside.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.970
The Police are here.
They are looking for the three of you.

00:31:54.678 --> 00:31:57.345
And they plan to come here.

00:31:58.012 --> 00:32:00.053
We should leave immediately.
- Listen.

00:32:02.178 --> 00:32:03.470
Don't go like this.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.095
Let's go.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.178
Where is Chitwan?

00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:12.095
Are you ready, guys? Let's go.

00:32:13.012 --> 00:32:14.762
Come.
- What the hell!

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.428
The fitting wasn't right.

00:32:17.512 --> 00:32:18.137
Chitwan, please.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.345
The Police will be here any minute.
What are you doing?

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.762
I'm not afraid of the Police.
- Wear this cap.

00:32:21.053 --> 00:32:21.595
Baba.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.178
My hair will get mussed up.
- Never mind your hair.

00:32:23.303 --> 00:32:24.762
The Policemen will
come now and make you bald.

00:32:25.012 --> 00:32:25.762
"Hair."

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.178
Even my son doesn't wear a cap.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.762
Thankfully he comes
to the mosque on Eid.

00:32:50.095 --> 00:32:51.262
Greetings.

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.137
What brings you here?

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.803
Greetings.

00:32:55.178 --> 00:32:58.553
Pardon me but we received a
message on the wireless early morning..

00:32:58.887 --> 00:33:00.137
..for everyone to assemble here.

00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:02.637
The other Officers
will be coming too.

00:33:03.012 --> 00:33:04.137
Is everything okay?

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.970
Yes.

00:33:05.053 --> 00:33:06.220
I guess the Nawab
must have some business..

00:33:06.553 --> 00:33:07.762
..which is why he
must have called you.

00:33:08.012 --> 00:33:09.512
He is inside.
Go and see him.

00:33:15.887 --> 00:33:17.053
These are our guests.

00:33:17.512 --> 00:33:18.678
They were leaving.

00:33:18.928 --> 00:33:19.678
They're going to Barabanki.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.095
Wow!
Very good!

00:33:22.678 --> 00:33:25.012
You must go to Deva Sharif.
- Of course, sir.

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:27.928
That is the goal of my life.

00:33:28.845 --> 00:33:32.428
Pardon me but he is vantage.
- He is advantage

00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:34.970
Vantage means convenience.
- Oh!

00:33:35.137 --> 00:33:36.387
God have mercy!

00:33:36.678 --> 00:33:38.720
God!
- Will you two stop speaking in Urdu!

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.428
Come in.

00:33:41.637 --> 00:33:42.887
I guess we will leave.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.970
We have to get there quickly.

00:33:45.428 --> 00:33:46.178
That would be right.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.345
Baba, I shall carry your bag.

00:34:07.553 --> 00:34:08.887
Come on, Baba.
Give me the key.

00:34:09.095 --> 00:34:10.137
What happened? - You aren't
going to drive. You're high.

00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:12.387
I can drive correctly
even when I'm high.

00:34:18.095 --> 00:34:18.887
Oh!

00:34:20.095 --> 00:34:21.720
Oh, Salman!

00:34:21.803 --> 00:34:22.887
What news do you have?

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:24.887
Get some rest.

00:34:29.428 --> 00:34:31.887
From Gharia ghat to Tollygang depot.

00:34:34.137 --> 00:34:35.178
Chilla!

00:34:35.678 --> 00:34:36.887
Wake up the guests.

00:34:38.095 --> 00:34:42.887
Tell them to look for
Prince Pranav in Kolkata.
