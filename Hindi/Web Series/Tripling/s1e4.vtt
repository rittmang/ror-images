WEBVTT

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.748
Where did chotu go?

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:47.241
He's gone inside to keep
the bucket that you threw.

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:49.788
Hey mister, they took our car.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.225
The three chics took your car.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.852
They made a big fool of you.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.601
Men can't think straight
with a hot-head.

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.839
Car, money, honour, wife.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:05.205
Kings have lost their kingdoms
due to this hot-hotheadedness.

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.855
Battles were fought!

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:09.155
Hello, sir. I'm all right.
Please talk decently.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.911
Let me talk.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:14.122
I'm the wife of Pranav Kumar.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.859
Oh, your highness, please order.

00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:19.877
These are my brothers.

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:22.487
We were lost,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.502
so those chics helped us.

00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:26.219
Do you know anything about them?

00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:28.348
I don't know much
about them, your highness.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.514
These ladies come from Punjab,

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:32.072
fuck innocent people...

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:34.355
I mean, fool innocent people.

00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:35.940
People say that,

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.980
they come here and do some dirty work.

00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:41.638
And then rob valuables like wallets,
clothes and in your case, car.

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:44.486
No one informs the police?

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:47.139
Since the chics are from Punjab,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.014
Bhatinda,

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:50.403
and then you know,

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:51.792
policemen are lazy.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.493
Policemen here have
jurisdiction here,

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:55.255
Policemen there have
jurisdiction there.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.972
It's all messed up.

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:58.559
No one is interested in working.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:02.386
Couldn't you have told us when
they were taking our car?

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:04.460
Please forgive me, your highness.

00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:06.880
It's a source of entertainment for me.

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.275
There is no TV, cable,

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:11.345
and the internet speed also is 2g.

00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:13.619
I would advise you.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.098
Take the highway,

00:02:15.108 --> 00:02:16.308
and catch the car.

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:17.707
That bus is crap.

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.350
Won't have made it far.

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:22.340
I'm saying, let's just go to the cops.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:22.969
Fuck this shit.

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:26.670
No, then Pranav will get to know about
all this and that'll be another mess.

00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:29.809
If anything happens to Tiago,

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:30.806
I won't be able to live.

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:32.155
Quit your melodrama.

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:34.645
Let's hitch a ride
from here till the highway,

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:35.677
then we'll figure out the rest.

00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:37.572
Why hitch a ride on a tempo?

00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:38.688
Your highness,

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.504
offer me a chance to serve you.

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:41.882
In my opinion,

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:43.689
you should rent one of my cars.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.989
And get going.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.826
Let's discuss the budget.

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:50.263
This.

00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:52.386
And this.

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:54.362
Both move like a knife on butter.

00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:36.463
Where are we?

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.714
All these used cars
are up for sale.

00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:42.786
Yeah, but isn't it too quiet?

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.759
Baba, I think we shouldn't
take Chanchal along.

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:48.983
So you'll leave me in the parking lot?

00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:52.570
I'm concerned about your safety.
You don't need to bark.

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:55.505
I wish our parents had thought
so much about safety.

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:57.107
That's very rude huh?

00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:57.941
Very rude.

00:04:57.954 --> 00:04:58.853
You deserve it.

00:04:58.986 --> 00:04:59.846
Hey.

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:01.234
How is it my fault?

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:04.621
And if you had obediently had sex with
Shoshana then we wouldn't be running

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:07.200
around in the desert like refugees
and the car wouldn't have been stolen.

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:10.133
I think you're right.
It's my fault.

00:05:11.236 --> 00:05:12.055
It's okay.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.420
Oh!

00:05:17.995 --> 00:05:18.995
Okay.

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:20.556
Sarcasm?

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:22.315
Nice.

00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:48.469
Um, excuse me, mister.

00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:50.431
Yeah?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.670
Tell me.

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:54.785
Epic.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.529
We wanted a favour from you.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900
Tell me.

00:05:59.334 --> 00:06:00.334
We...

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:03.645
Man, wh...what are you
doing with this phone.

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:04.932
Baba this is beautiful!

00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:07.177
Um, we are

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:08.456
looking for them.

00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:12.917
Have you gone crazy?

00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:14.612
Is your fate doomed?

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:15.833
Don't go looking for them.

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.205
But, they stole our car.

00:06:18.284 --> 00:06:21.234
That is what they do.

00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:23.986
So we just want to talk to them.

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:25.600
Don't talk to them.

00:06:25.798 --> 00:06:27.716
You need to talk to their daddy.

00:06:27.993 --> 00:06:29.152
Where will we find their dad?

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.189
<i>Right in this lane.</i>

00:06:31.587 --> 00:06:33.306
<i>Ahead of Lucky's store.</i>

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.475
This must be it.

00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:50.756
Baba.

00:06:50.783 --> 00:06:52.131
He is doing it with all
three of them together

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:54.786
Should we knock?

00:06:54.857 --> 00:06:57.118
Sshh.. element of surprise.

00:06:57.143 --> 00:06:58.902
What if he shoots us in
the name of surprise.

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:00.989
Let's open this.

00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:02.952
Baba, one,two...

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:04.671
Hey, quite.

00:07:11.183 --> 00:07:12.558
Chitvan shalom!

00:07:12.563 --> 00:07:13.563
Hey, Soshan.

00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:15.177
Baby.

00:07:15.552 --> 00:07:16.552
Who's that?

00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:18.351
Hey.

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:21.526
Friends!

00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:23.206
Come.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:24.335
You are?

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:25.348
Polo Marco.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.158
You already met Shoshana.

00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:29.304
Jael.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.136
Tahliya.

00:07:30.163 --> 00:07:31.869
Yeah we met them,
they stole our car.

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:33.505
Now which car?

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:35.044
My car, Tiago.

00:07:35.124 --> 00:07:36.124
9590.

00:07:37.068 --> 00:07:38.068
Oops.

00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:39.634
Oops?

00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:41.018
Your car's gone.

00:07:41.684 --> 00:07:42.684
Where?

00:07:42.887 --> 00:07:45.176
Here, there everywhere.

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:46.777
-What?
-Let it go.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.814
Hey, baby.

00:07:48.893 --> 00:07:50.639
No, don't be naughty.

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:52.406
Come here, come to daddy.

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:54.496
Come, come,
come, come, come.

00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:56.885
I am sorry.

00:07:57.473 --> 00:07:58.473
I love them.

00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.581
They are like my daughters.

00:08:02.486 --> 00:08:04.337
Don't be naughty.
Go, go, go.

00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:06.943
So, uh.

00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:08.517
Are you from Israel?

00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:09.874
Israel?

00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:12.023
They are from Pune.

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:14.483
My real name is Makrant Pol.

00:08:15.264 --> 00:08:16.890
Here Polo Marco.

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:19.840
Met these babies outside Osho ashram.

00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:22.658
Okay so, so what.

00:08:22.684 --> 00:08:24.232
Have you dismantled our car?

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:25.999
Good, good, good, man.

00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:28.576
Listen Mr.

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:29.660
Pol.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.935
North pole, south pole, Makrant Pol.

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:34.938
Sir your English isn't very good.

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.340
Can we switch to Hindi please?

00:08:36.407 --> 00:08:38.007
Is it okay if we talk in Hindi?

00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:39.483
Yeah, cool.

00:08:39.931 --> 00:08:41.155
Okay, so you are saying

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.113
that you have dismantled
our car and sold it?

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.523
Correct.

00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:45.528
What the fuck!

00:08:45.912 --> 00:08:47.168
Hey, wait a minute.

00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:48.874
So now what should be done?

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.166
You tell.

00:08:50.237 --> 00:08:51.586
You won't get the car back.

00:08:53.438 --> 00:08:54.523
How about a massage?

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.322
Hey you fool stop joking about it.

00:08:56.347 --> 00:08:58.279
One minute, one minute, Chitvan.
We'll go to the police.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:58.909
We will go to the police

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:00.599
Yeah, yeah good idea.

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:01.750
But what is the proof?

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:03.012
Documents of the car.

00:09:03.187 --> 00:09:04.758
You have the documents, right?

00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:06.306
They are there in the car.

00:09:06.544 --> 00:09:06.869
What?

00:09:07.608 --> 00:09:08.163
Yeah

00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:09.393
You must be having copies of it, right?

00:09:10.147 --> 00:09:10.750
It is there in the car.

00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:12.210
Any RC or anything?

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.298
Maybe you kept something in your wallet?

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:14.766
Will I roam around
with it in my pocket?

00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:15.790
Why won't you? He took your wallet as well

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.073
Make her understand.

00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:19.123
Cars get stolen sometimes.

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:20.234
-Fuck man!
-Just stop it!

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:21.773
Amazing, you guys.

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:23.457
Let's just fucking go to the cops.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:24.679
Come on, guys.

00:09:26.112 --> 00:09:27.112
What is this?

00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:29.247
Protection.

00:09:29.843 --> 00:09:31.588
The thing is,
a lot of thefts happen here.

00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:32.533
Listen

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:33.819
Marco Polo, whatever it is!

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:34.890
Hey!

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:37.377
I'll hit you real hard.

00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:38.393
Just stop it. Leave him

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:39.917
Stop it, Chitvan!

00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:41.322
Just stop it, Chitvan!

00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:42.845
Stop it I said. One minute.

00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:45.211
Hey.

00:09:45.766 --> 00:09:46.782
Wallet.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.164
Yeah, I'm giving it, sorry.

00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:52.750
Hold on.

00:09:55.972 --> 00:09:57.572
Baba, what are you doing?

00:09:57.892 --> 00:09:58.925
Let me handle this.

00:10:00.322 --> 00:10:01.322
Oh nice.

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:03.028
Dollars.

00:10:03.616 --> 00:10:04.616
I love dollars.

00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:05.957
Take this.

00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:07.472
I have left five hundred.

00:10:07.568 --> 00:10:09.449
Feed the kids vadapav, okay?

00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:12.050
Now things are settled between us.

00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:14.193
Go straight home, okay?

00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:15.979
Go straight,

00:10:16.352 --> 00:10:17.352
home.

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:18.486
Come, let's get out of here.

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:20.471
Come, Chitvan.

00:10:20.693 --> 00:10:21.494
Let's go.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.534
Move, move.

00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:23.558
I gave him money.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400
Baba.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.670
Do you understand
the meaning of an elder brother?

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:49.472
What?

00:10:49.655 --> 00:10:51.520
You shat your pants in there.

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:53.528
You were distributing money like a cow.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.750
Did I have any other options?

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.647
He slapped me and you didn't even move.

00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:59.467
If you hadn't moved much,
you wouldn't have gotten slapped.

00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:02.007
That's your answer?

00:11:02.983 --> 00:11:04.847
And what if he molested Chanchal?
What would you have done?

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.657
Nothing right?

00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:06.879
Just shut up Chitvan, okay?

00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:09.197
This happened just
because of your foolishness.

00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:11.046
What the fuck did I do?

00:11:11.165 --> 00:11:13.234
Was it necessary to argue in front of him.

00:11:13.354 --> 00:11:14.385
Do you have the documents?

00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:15.536
Photocopies of the documents?

00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:16.472
What is in your purse?

00:11:16.497 --> 00:11:18.218
I was just reacting naturally.

00:11:18.862 --> 00:11:19.862
At least I reacted.

00:11:20.036 --> 00:11:21.036
Unlike you.

00:11:21.076 --> 00:11:22.687
Oh come on, not you too okay?

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.028
What was I supposed to do?

00:11:24.044 --> 00:11:25.329
Should I have hit them back?

00:11:25.544 --> 00:11:26.893
If they would have beaten us up,

00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:28.139
and done something with Chanchal,

00:11:28.164 --> 00:11:29.679
then could we have done something?

00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:32.583
It was smart to quietly leave that place
and go to the police after that.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600
Baba.

00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:35.822
I used to call you a loser jokingly.

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:38.710
Today you actually showed
how fainthearted you are.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.250
If you hadn't stopped me...

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:42.060
Hey, Jackie Chan, I didn't stop you.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.528
That guy slapped you
and his goons stopped you.

00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:45.980
And if you were so angry?

00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:47.956
Why didn't you beat
them up then and there?

00:11:48.068 --> 00:11:49.599
Why were you waiting for my support?

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.345
You were spending your fuckk all life

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.663
without my support for so many years?

00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.711
Then what happened today?

00:11:55.322 --> 00:11:57.012
I ran away exactly from this shit.

00:11:57.346 --> 00:11:58.346
I was happy there only.

00:11:58.909 --> 00:11:59.861
Great.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:00.917
So now you admit it.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.242
That running away from your problems
has always been your habit.

00:12:03.378 --> 00:12:04.933
Oh please you don't speak okay?

00:12:05.298 --> 00:12:06.568
You also ran away, didn't you?

00:12:06.854 --> 00:12:09.028
If you were that unhappy,
why didn't you leave earlier?

00:12:09.336 --> 00:12:11.528
Pranav was heckling you out of the house.

00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.996
-I ran away for you two...
-Oh, come on please.

00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:15.814
Please dude, cut the crap okay?

00:12:16.187 --> 00:12:18.344
There is no such deep love amongst us.

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:20.407
There is a situational comedy happening.

00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:21.796
That's why we are together.

00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:24.542
Otherwise nobody
is bothered about each other.

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:27.248
We don't even know what
is going on in our lives.

00:12:27.344 --> 00:12:28.725
And why do you think that happened?

00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:30.288
Because we don't fucking care.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.909
Whatever I did in there,

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:33.766
was because I care about you guys.

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:37.536
And do you actually think
I was scared of that shithead?

00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:38.925
You think I am scared of him?

00:12:39.338 --> 00:12:40.703
I can't beat him up?

00:12:42.172 --> 00:12:43.957
Motherfucker, I'll show him right now.

00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:44.965
See what I do!

00:13:52.616 --> 00:13:54.300
Baba! Baba!`

00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:57.020
Stop breaking shit
and being a hero.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.268
The villian is getting away.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.409
I found my Tiago.

00:14:27.544 --> 00:14:28.695
I love you my life.

00:14:29.576 --> 00:14:30.949
See, the Tiago.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.734
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:42.536
Sir, save me.

00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:44.147
This guy has gone mad.

00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:45.161
He'll kill me, sir.

00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:47.821
Sir, this guy and his
three girls together...

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:48.988
Sir they are my daughters.

00:14:49.028 --> 00:14:49.766
Three daughters?

00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:50.949
Yes, sir. He and his brother

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:52.504
were trying to molest my daughters.

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:53.393
You molested his daughters?

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:54.274
Hey, shut up!

00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:56.854
Yes, sir. My poor girls were changing.

00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:58.393
And he was peeping in.

00:14:58.536 --> 00:14:59.536
My kids yelled,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.560
I came outside.

00:15:00.592 --> 00:15:02.941
This guy started touching them, sir.

00:15:02.973 --> 00:15:04.274
What nonsense is he saying?

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:06.449
I tried stopping him

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:08.131
and he hit me with a rod instead, sir.

00:15:08.155 --> 00:15:08.917
Look at this, sir...

00:15:08.933 --> 00:15:09.933
Sir, he...

00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:13.270
Sir, his three daughters

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.366
were drinking beer in the desert.

00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:18.159
He stole our car, was dismantling it
and selling it.

00:15:18.326 --> 00:15:20.334
Baba, I found the car
it's parked right outside.

00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:35.838
Baba.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.030
Are you sleeping?

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:42.949
It is a little uncomfortable, isn't it?

00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:48.296
Do you know ladies' cell
is way better than this.

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:50.360
They have mosquito repellents too.

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:52.035
I saw.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.026
You should be happy, Baba.

00:15:56.941 --> 00:15:58.845
I told you, right?
This experience is necessary.

00:15:59.052 --> 00:16:00.433
Even you know how it feels now.

00:16:00.719 --> 00:16:02.091
Now you're a real man.

00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:06.795
Should I give you a tip?

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.417
In a hostel or jail.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.377
It is best to empty your stomach
first thing in the morning.

00:16:11.735 --> 00:16:13.718
After that the commode
doesn't stay fit to be used.

00:16:14.401 --> 00:16:17.107
And your hygiene habits...
How rude!

00:16:21.143 --> 00:16:22.143
Mister.

00:16:22.921 --> 00:16:25.444
Do you feel like going to the loo
early in the morning?

00:16:32.246 --> 00:16:34.016
Come, you guys have been bailed out.

00:16:40.798 --> 00:16:41.798
Hmm get up.

00:17:03.997 --> 00:17:04.997
Hey, What's up?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.949
Oh, he's still in his character.

00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:12.832
Chanchal called me.

00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:14.608
In the middle of the night.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:17.005
So...

00:17:18.457 --> 00:17:20.528
So, you came all the way
to Bhatinda for us?

00:17:21.247 --> 00:17:22.247
For her.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.350
Awww.

00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:27.183
Your car keys.

00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:29.101
It's parked outside.

00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:30.469
And that...

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.262
wooden carriage, what is that?

00:17:34.036 --> 00:17:36.655
Batmobile, we took it on rent...
Nevermind...

00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:37.909
Sir.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:38.718
I can go right?

00:17:38.822 --> 00:17:39.822
Yes, of course.

00:17:39.838 --> 00:17:40.838
Thanks, Pranav.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.329
Baba, I'll see you outside.

00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:43.401
Come, come.

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:46.179
Khurana, sir. Thank you very much.

00:17:46.314 --> 00:17:47.306
No Kuwar, sir.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.933
Why are you making it a big deal?

00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:52.389
Don't thank me just give
my salutation to the colonel.

00:17:52.627 --> 00:17:53.627
Sure.

00:17:53.643 --> 00:17:55.841
Make sure you catch that fraud.
He shouldn't be troubling anybody else.

00:17:55.865 --> 00:17:57.952
Absolutely, Sir.He is lucky,
he escaped this time.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:17:59.719
We'll catch him, sir.

00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:02.976
And brother you,
try to control a little.

00:18:03.722 --> 00:18:05.482
All these blonde, brunette...

00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:07.649
Everyday guys are locked up for them.

00:18:07.664 --> 00:18:09.037
No, no, no, you are misunderstanding me.

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.006
It is not a wrong thing.

00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:11.038
It is very natural.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.522
But there is nothing like that, sir.

00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:13.605
Chandan, Chandan.

00:18:14.617 --> 00:18:15.617
Let it go.

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:19.467
Sir, understood.

00:18:33.749 --> 00:18:34.749
Thanks.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:37.908
I'll leave.

00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:40.939
You have the car...

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:44.135
And Chanchal is...

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:47.741
Where is she?

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.257
Ticket.

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:55.979
Manali.

00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:02.163
Baba, I have taken parathas
and chips to eat on the way.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.623
We'll drink fresh lassi ahead.

00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:04.695
Hey listen, I...

00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:09.489
What is this?

00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:10.894
What?

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.636
What the fuck is this?

00:19:15.077 --> 00:19:16.151
Oh, this?

00:19:16.463 --> 00:19:18.860
It was a prayer to find the car.

00:19:18.887 --> 00:19:20.553
Bhole baba, Neelkanth.

00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:22.987
It changes shades.

00:19:23.278 --> 00:19:25.606
Gets better.

00:19:26.188 --> 00:19:28.119
I can't do this.

00:19:28.939 --> 00:19:31.135
-I can't do this. I'm sorry...
-What?

00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:33.708
I can't fucking look at you right now.

00:19:33.807 --> 00:19:36.337
Coming to you is the biggest
fucking mistake of my life.

00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:40.743
What are you saying?

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.770
Fuck you, man!

00:19:43.204 --> 00:19:44.938
Baba, you're just jealous.

00:19:45.162 --> 00:19:46.162
Okay, sorry!

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:49.592
Family helps you out during a crisis.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.304
But when the family is full of fools...

00:19:52.384 --> 00:19:54.024
They create a crisis.

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:56.217
Go Mumbai Indians!

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.154
I should've gone straight
to mom and dad in Manali.

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.233
Baba!

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.158
Compatibility...

00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:34.261
♫ A mother asks, ♫

00:20:34.288 --> 00:20:45.925
♫ “Oh my daughter, what bothers you?” ♫

00:20:50.987 --> 00:20:55.132
♫ “Oh, mother where does the moon go, ♫

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.273
♫  Where do the stars go, ♫

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:07.639
♫ And where do the ones we love go?” ♫

00:21:07.692 --> 00:21:11.819
♫ Oh daughter, the moon may hide, ♫

00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:15.919
♫ The stars may disappear, ♫

00:21:16.052 --> 00:21:24.888
♫ The ones close to our hearts
Never leave us ♫
