WEBVTT

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:01.498
I don't understand anything.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.319
Yeah. Their language is a little weird.

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:06.818
I am not talking about the language.

00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:08.529
I am talking about the situation.

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:10.357
Which situation?

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:13.949
Oh!

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.536
The fake pregnancy thing.

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:16.755
What's wrong with you?

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:19.459
We don't understand
Marwari but

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:20.793
they understand Hindi.

00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:23.035
What tete-e-tete is up  here?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.494
Our guests are dying to meet you.

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:26.337
Chit chat?

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:29.935
No, we were... We should have socialized.
We were...

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.937
Let's go.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:48.659
So, your wife's a foreigner?

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:49.925
Yes.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.222
I have seen foreigners.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:54.627
They keep visiting this place.

00:01:55.192 --> 00:01:55.809
Okay.

00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:58.875
It must be incredible, right?

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:00.805
With a foreigner?

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:07.675
Come on, tell me more.

00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.151
How long have you known Chanchal?

00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:16.112
I am her brother.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.624
Oh,

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.390
Then you must know her
for quite some time.

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:24.960
You're divorced?

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:27.280
Yes.

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:29.219
Why?

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.470
There were some differences.

00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:35.444
Obviously, you would have left her.

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.141
Why would anyone leave you?

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.197
You'll spend a couple of nights
with us, right?

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.509
In the mansion.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.728
I'm a DJ.

00:02:51.385 --> 00:02:52.385
I play music.

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:54.290
Okay, okay.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:55.847
Which instrument do you play?

00:02:56.282 --> 00:02:57.550
No. I...

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.956
I use a computer to mix music.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:02.735
I compose on my own.

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:03.903
On a computer?

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:04.938
Yeah.

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:07.344
Then what is your talent in that?

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.038
It's a complicated process.

00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:16.625
It's imperative to have
an understanding of music.

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.492
Do you have it?

00:03:20.147 --> 00:03:22.191
No. I mean, you can't play any instrument

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:24.098
like tabla, sarangi, tanpura etc.

00:03:24.123 --> 00:03:25.286
You are more of a

00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:26.756
remix guy, right?

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:29.913
Hey,

00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:32.161
What's the point in arguing, uncle?

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.871
He plays modern music.

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.186
Listen to it once at least.

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:39.482
Lunch.

00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:41.179
Lunch is served.

00:04:54.018 --> 00:04:55.612
I really liked your song.

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:58.117
Hmm.. It was quite nice.

00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.498
Yeah. But the others were staring
at me like

00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:01.989
played a hymn in a pub.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.977
Don't worry about these vintage people..

00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:07.124
They are not your audience.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:11.842
How do you live with
these people, Chanchal?

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:13.945
It's not easy but..

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.970
I am used to it now.

00:05:17.944 --> 00:05:19.858
What happened to Pranav?

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:21.410
He was such a cool guy.

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.533
He has turned into an ass.

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:23.714
What are you saying, man?

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:24.613
Why?

00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:26.287
He is right.

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.895
He used to be so cool in college.

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.266
Now he is like Anil Kapoor from Virasat.

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:34.509
His mustache is so dense that

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.346
when I kiss him, all I get is hair.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.618
Chanchal, you..

00:05:39.643 --> 00:05:41.834
Are you happy here?
Are you okay?

00:05:42.397 --> 00:05:43.189
Yeah, I...

00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:44.568
I think so.

00:05:44.986 --> 00:05:46.724
Actually...

00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:54.131
Son, even the camels here have a
better sense of music than you.

00:05:54.156 --> 00:05:55.527
What was that?

00:05:55.552 --> 00:05:57.312
Uncle, you see..

00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:58.518
You might not have enjoyed it..

00:05:58.543 --> 00:05:59.172
Listen, son.

00:05:59.197 --> 00:06:00.686
Let go of this DJ thing.

00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.786
You should learn to play
music from these kids.

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.431
You will earn a lot.

00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:05.859
They go for world tours.

00:06:05.884 --> 00:06:07.648
Foreigners are crazy about them.

00:06:07.673 --> 00:06:09.338
Now.. You must be knowing Madonna?

00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:09.915
Yes. Absolutely.

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:11.945
Madonna. She came here last week.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.323
You see that kid playing there?

00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:15.086
She kissed him on his cheek.

00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.908
Oh, wow!

00:06:16.694 --> 00:06:17.481
Buniya.

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:18.379
Come here.

00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:23.481
Where did Madonna kiss you?

00:06:24.003 --> 00:06:25.317
Oh wow! So nice.

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:27.325
Uncle, your ride is here.

00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:28.176
Let's go, uncle.

00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.524
My wishes are with you.

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:33.735
Fucked up old nut!

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.235
Can we go and get a drink somewhere?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.792
No!

00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:38.643
That won't be possible.

00:06:38.738 --> 00:06:39.338
Why?

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:43.047
This is not US or Mumbai.

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:44.486
The system is a little different here.

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.932
Chanchal going out for a drink?
That too with strangers..

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:52.343
Bro, we are her brothers.

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:54.221
But how will the onlookers know?

00:06:54.634 --> 00:06:56.245
Should we tie rakhis?

00:07:00.117 --> 00:07:01.854
See, I don't want to argue.

00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:03.485
There are certain rules here.

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:05.612
Chanchal is the queen.

00:07:06.017 --> 00:07:07.213
First lady.

00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:10.995
So, she is not supposed
to mingle with commoners.

00:07:14.014 --> 00:07:15.565
Pranav?

00:07:17.327 --> 00:07:19.889
Listen, I really don't understand
what the big deal is?

00:07:20.663 --> 00:07:21.508
Listen.

00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:24.195
Can we not get into a discussion
about this right now?

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.141
Please? Don't talk about it now?

00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:29.056
And by the way, I  have
a great plan for you people.

00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:30.588
I'm going to play Polo.

00:07:30.953 --> 00:07:31.977
You also accompany us.

00:07:32.002 --> 00:07:33.038
Watch the match.

00:07:33.063 --> 00:07:34.031
And then after that...

00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:35.582
You will taste our Khus flavored alcohol.

00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:37.566
And Faluda (sweet) for you.

00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:39.282
Polo?

00:07:39.368 --> 00:07:40.195
Khus?

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.240
Faluda?

00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:42.250
Shall we go?

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.805
So, now you know what
I am dealing with.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.485
But, what is this fake pregnancy thing?

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:56.407
The entire family is after me.

00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:57.532
Pressurizing me.

00:07:57.854 --> 00:08:00.215
They are dying for an heir.

00:08:00.394 --> 00:08:02.110
But things aren't there yet.

00:08:02.618 --> 00:08:03.618
What?

00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:06.329
You and Pranav haven't had sex yet?

00:08:06.354 --> 00:08:08.064
Of course we have had sex, you idiot.

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:10.438
I just haven't got pregnant yet.

00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:13.542
Chanchu, are you infertile?

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.165
What are you saying, man?

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.432
She's your sister!

00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:21.315
No, Chitvan. I am quite fertile.
Thank you.

00:08:21.354 --> 00:08:22.261
It's just...

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:24.841
I don't want a child yet.

00:08:34.234 --> 00:08:35.726
So, why don't you want a child?

00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:38.730
I am not sure.

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:42.066
First of all, Pranav and I
should be on the same page.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.434
Same page?

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:47.340
As of now, you both are
are on different books.

00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.254
You are an expert on relationships, right?

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:52.827
Baba, I am the only one in this car

00:08:52.852 --> 00:08:54.521
whose marriage is not in ruins.

00:08:54.546 --> 00:08:56.467
Yeah, because you are not married...

00:08:57.124 --> 00:08:58.373
He is such an idiot.

00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:00.826
Forget it. It's futile talking to him.

00:09:01.858 --> 00:09:03.170
Tell me, what do you want to do now?

00:09:03.499 --> 00:09:05.557
You have lied about this whole thing.

00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:08.197
Sooner or later, the truth will be out.

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:13.033
To be honest, I have not
thought it through.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.781
I just told a small lie. I had no idea
that the entire thing will...

00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:17.488
So, what's the plan now?

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:21.277
Listen.

00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:24.386
You should get pregnant.

00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:27.935
Make love after Polo tonight.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.454
Don't talk about all of this
in front of me, Chitvan.

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:34.126
I will forward you a picture on WhatsApp.

00:09:34.209 --> 00:09:36.216
It shows best positions for quick results.

00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:39.183
Chitvan, just stop this nonsense.
Please!

00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:45.008
Fuck. I need a drink.

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:53.757
Hello.

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:55.536
Yeah, hello. What happened?

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.122
Yeah, listen.

00:09:57.147 --> 00:09:59.695
I am not feeling too well.

00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:02.835
Okay. So I will just call them
and cancel the tournament.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.045
Send the horses
back to the stable.

00:10:05.407 --> 00:10:07.585
No. Don't send the horses back.

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:11.023
Listen, I will go back
home with these guys.

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:13.163
We have a lot of catching
up to do anyways.

00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:14.610
You should go ahead.

00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:15.622
Are you sure?

00:10:16.126 --> 00:10:16.821
Yeah.

00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:19.258
Bye.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.157
Okay. I'll see you at dinner.

00:10:22.407 --> 00:10:24.836
Don't send the horses.
Bring them back.

00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:26.102
Let's go.

00:10:35.498 --> 00:10:36.761
Are we clear?

00:10:37.962 --> 00:10:38.998
So?

00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:40.512
Where are we going?

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.469
Mansion, right?

00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:44.714
Baba.

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:47.413
You are beautiful.

00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:56.000
Chanchu.
Yeah.

00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:58.289
Remember you had a boyfriend
back in college?

00:10:58.602 --> 00:11:00.962
His name sounded like some sea-food?

00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:02.376
Ajitesh Jhingan?

00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:03.735
Jhingan!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.056
Yeah.

00:11:05.322 --> 00:11:06.389
Yeah. I met him.

00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:07.531
He was at my club.

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:08.483
Yeah?

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:09.890
You left him or he left you?

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:12.444
I left him, bro.

00:11:12.962 --> 00:11:14.280
Big mistake.

00:11:14.345 --> 00:11:16.820
He is a millionaire now.
You should have married him.

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:19.164
Logic is not your strong point, right?

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:20.902
Pranav is also rich.

00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:23.172
Yeah. But he is in a desert, Baba.

00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:25.125
He doesn't come to my club.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.500
Listen, one second.
What happened to your girlfriend?

00:11:27.525 --> 00:11:28.527
Shuchi?

00:11:33.955 --> 00:11:35.624
Nothing.

00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:36.882
What do you mean?

00:11:36.907 --> 00:11:38.342
I mean..

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:42.233
She was my last girlfriend but
I was not her last boyfriend.

00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:48.810
By the way, my ex..

00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:49.884
I mean..

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.552
You already know
about my ex-wife.

00:11:53.782 --> 00:11:54.795
Sorry?

00:11:56.767 --> 00:11:57.547
No..

00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:00.532
Well, it was my turn, right?

00:12:02.749 --> 00:12:04.920
I thought it's my turn.

00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:07.282
You guys are done now, so..

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.492
I thought...that...

00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:11.387
Oh, fuck it.

00:12:18.462 --> 00:12:20.651
Full FOMO.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.250
What is FOMO?

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:23.507
FOMO?

00:12:23.532 --> 00:12:24.292
What?

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:26.573
Fear Of Missing Out, Baba.

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:28.939
#GetWithIt, big bro.

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:30.373
What is this?

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:35.568
I thought US would make
him a little cool.

00:12:35.977 --> 00:12:36.935
Whiskey.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.834
Which one?

00:12:39.357 --> 00:12:40.662
Any.

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:53.899
Hi.

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:55.063
Hi.

00:12:55.798 --> 00:12:57.094
Payal.

00:12:57.154 --> 00:12:59.485
Hi, I am Chandan. How are you?

00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:02.976
So, Chandan. Can I
buy you a drink?

00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:05.837
Sorry?

00:13:06.864 --> 00:13:09.516
Since you did not ask.
I thought I should.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.785
I'm so sorry. Can I buy you a...

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.446
What will you have?

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:15.165
It depends.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:17.687
On what?

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:20.164
On our plans after the drink.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.884
You can join us for dinner.

00:13:33.117 --> 00:13:34.955
Everyone eats after a drink.

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:37.634
Why don't we do something different?

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:42.087
Give me another drink.

00:13:42.368 --> 00:13:43.529
Different as in?

00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:46.583
Like...

00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:48.490
I don't know.

00:13:49.212 --> 00:13:50.349
Dancing.

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:54.255
Dancing?

00:13:56.678 --> 00:13:58.037
I can't dance.

00:14:19.502 --> 00:14:21.290
Look at Baba grooving.

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:23.696
Taking out all the
frustration of the divorce.

00:14:23.721 --> 00:14:25.805
It's like he's in a trance.

00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:31.680
What did the chillum
Baba mix in this, man?

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:34.008
I am seeing things.

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:35.424
I can even see my brother-in-law

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.803
Whooo

00:14:36.995 --> 00:14:38.163
What?

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:46.577
Hey!

00:14:46.602 --> 00:14:47.616
Hey

00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:52.811
Hey, pink shirt.
Play the music, man.

00:14:55.438 --> 00:14:57.366
How are you feeling now?

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.375
Look Pranav,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.798
-We just wanted to spend some time to...
-Please.

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.369
You were drinking.

00:15:13.723 --> 00:15:15.688
In your condition

00:15:16.613 --> 00:15:18.042
So irresponsible

00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:25.174
Whatever happened today,
shouldn't have happened

00:15:26.088 --> 00:15:28.729
The consequences of this will
be known tomorrow.

00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:32.588
As of now, to handle this
situation, I have taken a decision.

00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:33.822
What situation?

00:15:35.265 --> 00:15:36.304
Chandan.

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:37.329
Chitvan.

00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:39.026
I really regret saying this but,

00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:41.882
both of you need to leave
my house right now.

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:45.102
Dude, What the fuck!

00:16:05.883 --> 00:16:07.522
What is wrong with you?

00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:09.843
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:10.628
With me?

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:12.016
Ya bro there is something very

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.998
very very very wrong with you!

00:16:14.078 --> 00:16:15.843
Please stay quite, Chitvan.

00:16:15.868 --> 00:16:17.794
Hey, don't say please and all, man.

00:16:17.819 --> 00:16:19.732
And what is all this 'situation',
'tete-e-tete'?

00:16:19.883 --> 00:16:21.308
What are you saying man?

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:23.055
Chandan, please explain to him.

00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:25.376
Hey stop this thing!

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:26.698
Am I Alok Nath or what?

00:16:26.723 --> 00:16:29.106
Acting all royal and shit.
What is wrong with you, man?

00:16:29.264 --> 00:16:31.700
What do you want to say, man?
Say it clearly!

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:38.544
Why are you guys
fucking my case, man?

00:16:39.978 --> 00:16:42.470
I have so many responsibilities!

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:44.781
I am going to stand for the elections.

00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:47.704
I have to uphold a personality,
an image...

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:51.249
In your private life too?

00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:53.166
Chanchal you knew of my background.

00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:56.293
Yeah but I didn't know your background
would become your foreground.

00:16:56.397 --> 00:16:57.233
One minute, one minute

00:16:57.336 --> 00:16:58.197
S..,Sorry

00:16:58.222 --> 00:17:00.837
So, you do this maanyavar
acting all the time?

00:17:00.996 --> 00:17:03.195
This isn't acting
dude, this is my life.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.743
People have expectations from me.

00:17:05.047 --> 00:17:07.138
And you guys are creating
even more problems for me.

00:17:07.492 --> 00:17:10.676
Do you think I like throwing
you guys out of here?

00:17:10.907 --> 00:17:13.500
But if your behavior harms the
reputation of my family then...

00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:15.008
'Reputation'.
Oh, fuck me!

00:17:15.032 --> 00:17:17.165
How much Hindi does he
throw our way, Baba?

00:17:17.346 --> 00:17:18.696
What non-sense is this?

00:17:18.712 --> 00:17:20.412
Hey, you shut up, Chitvan.

00:17:20.555 --> 00:17:22.443
Just..Just be quite yeah or else I..

00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:23.436
Or else what?

00:17:23.461 --> 00:17:24.932
It'll be really bad.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.565
Hey!

00:17:25.668 --> 00:17:26.985
Are you threatening my brother?

00:17:27.063 --> 00:17:28.860
Look at how your brother's  behaving?

00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:30.382
Keeping aside the night's shenanigans,

00:17:30.407 --> 00:17:32.635
This Chitvan even ruined the whole party!

00:17:32.722 --> 00:17:33.618
What the hell were you playing?

00:17:33.672 --> 00:17:34.477
Huh! What were you playing?

00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:35.969
Don't say anything about
my music or else...

00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:36.797
Hey, you shut your face man!

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.672
I'll hit you with on your nose.

00:17:38.696 --> 00:17:39.313
You 'fuckin'!

00:17:39.344 --> 00:17:40.796
Hey... Hey Chandan.

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:41.984
And what were you doing?

00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:43.741
Such dirty, vulgar dance?

00:17:43.819 --> 00:17:45.159
You looked like a filthy pervert.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.040
This is why your wife
must have left you.

00:17:53.157 --> 00:17:54.139
Fuck!

00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:56.272
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry!

00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:58.313
Pranav, it was an impulsive thing
I... I didn't mean to...

00:17:58.384 --> 00:18:00.132
We'll go actually, you know...

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:00.868
Oh, f##k!

00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:02.586
Pranav!

00:18:03.806 --> 00:18:04.728
Baba

00:18:05.945 --> 00:18:07.175
Stop it, stop it!

00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:10.284
Pranav!

00:18:19.718 --> 00:18:20.458
Stop it!

00:18:20.483 --> 00:18:21.429
Enough!

00:18:22.316 --> 00:18:23.450
Hey!

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.263
Chanchal what...what do you intend to do?

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.997
I don't know.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.202
I am frustrated.

00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:29.173
By the way, it doesn't work.

00:18:29.352 --> 00:18:30.163
What?

00:18:30.188 --> 00:18:33.110
It is really old.
As old as the Sepoy mutiny.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:57.912
I am sorry, I think
I said a little too much.

00:18:59.967 --> 00:19:03.107
But it will be better if
both of you leave.

00:19:03.303 --> 00:19:03.834
No

00:19:04.641 --> 00:19:06.162
They aren't going anywhere.

00:19:06.282 --> 00:19:08.682
Chanchal, please stay out of this, okay?

00:19:09.032 --> 00:19:10.026
Why?

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.417
They are my brothers.

00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:15.846
Suddenly you are so
affectionate towards them?

00:19:15.991 --> 00:19:17.521
You guys don't talk
for three years at a stretch.

00:19:17.546 --> 00:19:19.943
You don't know how to be there
for each other.

00:19:19.973 --> 00:19:22.053
Suddenly they drop in here.
So now they are your brothers?

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.318
No, no I am sorry,
they have to go, okay?

00:19:24.343 --> 00:19:25.701
I need to answer...

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:27.508
My family, my people.

00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:29.357
Your people?

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:31.459
Who are your people, Pranav?

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:34.317
Get out of this Mangal Pandey era!

00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:35.668
Open your eyes.

00:19:35.849 --> 00:19:38.451
You are not the prince of any province.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.522
You are just the rich owner
of an old mansion.

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.198
And there are forty people
who sympathize about your family.

00:19:44.223 --> 00:19:46.671
And 40 people make a Whatsapp group.

00:19:46.696 --> 00:19:47.438
Not a kingdom!

00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:48.466
Shut up, Chanchal!

00:19:48.491 --> 00:19:49.858
Don't you dare talk
to me like that.

00:19:49.883 --> 00:19:51.266
Bro, just take it easy, okay?

00:19:51.329 --> 00:19:54.727
Listen, it will be better if you don't
interfere in our personal matters.

00:19:54.908 --> 00:19:55.766
Okay?

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.148
Chanchal, just go
to your room and I'll sort this.

00:19:58.173 --> 00:19:59.157
No!

00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:01.446
I'll do whatever I have to do.

00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:02.657
I am your wife, Pranav.

00:20:02.673 --> 00:20:03.868
Not a servant.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.782
And one more thing.

00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:06.336
These two will not go anywhere tonight.

00:20:06.368 --> 00:20:08.532
That is not for you to decide.

00:20:09.399 --> 00:20:10.196
Fine.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.836
If they go, I go.

00:20:12.687 --> 00:20:13.513
Go.

00:20:16.626 --> 00:20:17.735
Fine. Come.

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:18.939
One minute, one minute one minute

00:20:18.987 --> 00:20:20.233
Everybody just calm down.

00:20:20.272 --> 00:20:22.155
There's no need of so much stress.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.765
Chanchal, we were about to
leave in a while anyway. So

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.432
You know let's not stretch this thing.

00:20:26.457 --> 00:20:27.657
No, why shouldn't I stretch it?

00:20:27.704 --> 00:20:31.008
Is this how your Rajput ancestors
taught you to treat your guests?

00:20:31.023 --> 00:20:31.789
Chanchal, enough!

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:33.232
I am not scared of you, Pranav.

00:20:33.287 --> 00:20:35.898
I am not from the world which
bows in front of you, remember?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.755
Outside you roam around
like the king of the jungle.

00:20:37.787 --> 00:20:40.479
But the truth is that
in the bedroom you...

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:45.850
That means our brother-in-law is impotent?

00:20:54.423 --> 00:20:55.158
Just...

00:20:55.204 --> 00:20:57.221
Get the fuck out of my house.

00:21:01.698 --> 00:21:03.130
Just go.

00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:08.305
Come on.

00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:10.023
Let's go.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:10.937
It's done.

00:21:50.507 --> 00:21:51.421
Fuck!

00:21:58.235 --> 00:21:59.436
Take out the car.

00:22:01.562 --> 00:22:03.695
Which one should I take out, sir?

00:22:04.374 --> 00:22:05.131
Idiot!

00:22:05.335 --> 00:22:07.508
The one that works, that one.

00:22:07.687 --> 00:22:08.789
Yes, sir.
