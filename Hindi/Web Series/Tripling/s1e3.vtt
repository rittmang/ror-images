WEBVTT

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:50.930
Listen,

00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:52.274
Be angry for a few days

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:54.227
after that if  Pranav says sorry,
you go back.

00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:55.489
Fighting like this...

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.249
I don't want to talk about it.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.796
So are you planning to
actually leave him?

00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:05.280
Who breaks off a marriage like this?

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.288
Great!

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:16.987
I think I have set the wrong example
for the two of you.

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:19.820
Just because my marriage broke off...

00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:21.217
Baba, let it go.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.926
You can't solve everything
by talking it out.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.156
Hey Chitvan, it is a serious matter okay?

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:28.950
Chitvan, stop the car and drop me off.

00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:30.910
His sermons are not going to stop.

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:32.021
Amazing, if I try to talk...

00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:32.569
Hmmm...

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:34.038
Hmmm...

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:35.935
Hmm...

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:37.794
Buddha.

00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:40.673
Sermon!

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.726
The funny thing is I've heard
so much pure Hindi  in just a day, Baba.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.996
I am absolutely bedazzled.

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:53.401
Bedazzled!

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:57.756
I think we are heading the wrong way.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:59.121
Don't be negative, Baba.

00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:01.002
I am telling you we are lost.

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:03.049
Baba, chill.

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:05.375
I think.

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:06.803
We have to take a right ahead.

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:08.201
There is nothing right ahead.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.315
Everything is wrong here.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:10.458
Just take a U-turn now.

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:11.894
Baba, don't panic.

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:13.844
The tea stall guy told us
to go this way right?

00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:16.141
He also told us that we'll reach
the main road in 15 minutes.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.871
We have been going around
for one and a half hour!

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:21.660
Everyone here consumes Bhang(local liquor)
in the evening and then they speak rubbish.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.822
So then was it necessary
to  run off at midnight?

00:02:25.287 --> 00:02:27.136
We could have at the same
argument tomorrow morning, right?

00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:29.137
We could have peacefully had lunch
and then left.

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:31.445
Hey, just take a U-turn now.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.810
Baba

00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:35.302
Chitvan, just take a bloody U-turn.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.833
Hey look there, lights!

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:38.286
Where?

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.365
Something flickered there.

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:41.288
One second.

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:44.357
Hey, what are you doing?

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.079
Arrey, stupid fellow.

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:46.538
Baba I can see far off
things better, right?

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:48.426
You can't see anything nearby, idiot.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.784
Put that light back on!

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:51.775
Chitvan just switch on the light, man!

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.220
Arrey just swit...

00:02:53.744 --> 00:02:54.944
What the hell, man?

00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:01.426
What a loser, Baba?

00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:03.712
I am smart,

00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:05.093
not a scaredy-cat.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.043
What if something had
popped up in front of us suddenly?

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.099
What?

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.051
Ghosts?

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:20.416
Huh, what nonsense!

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.101
What if a man came
in front of the car?

00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:23.633
Or some animal, a deer or something?

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.027
Hey!

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.297
Hey, just stop it, man!

00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:34.479
It's not funny, okay?

00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.630
Baba, it's okay.

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:40.456
Everybody gets scared.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:42.879
Everybody shits their pants.

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.887
Chitvan.

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:47.871
Just switch on the light okay?

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:48.910
This is not funny.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:49.958
This is stupid and dangerous.

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:52.204
Where did that light go?

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.998
I don't know which light
you are talking about.

00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:55.188
I haven't seen any lights yet.

00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:56.949
I saw the lights there,

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:58.211
it was coming from the right side.

00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:00.166
No, it was coming from left,
from the extreme left.

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:01.880
Man, this is extremely stupid.

00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:03.007
Just stop the fucking car.

00:04:03.198 --> 00:04:04.015
We've just been fighting over

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.387
right and left,

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.825
and getting deeper in to the desert

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.179
Just stop the car right now, man!

00:04:21.882 --> 00:04:23.541
Baba we crossed a fence behind, no?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.390
Yeah, so?

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:30.967
Did we cross the border
and reach Pakistan?

00:04:31.513 --> 00:04:33.155
Yeah in the morning two policemen
will come and say,

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.854
"Sir, please come with us you are fucked."

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:36.925
Dude the border is near Jaisalmer,

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.052
we are in Jodhpur.

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:42.157
Hey.

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:43.958
It's a full moon.

00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:45.363
So?

00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:50.625
On a full moon night
the desert sand looks like silver.

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:54.276
Chitvan, what are you doing?

00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:56.443
Looking for wood for a bonfire.

00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.657
Hey, have we come here for a picnic?

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:02.514
Everybody's life is fucked
and we've lost our way.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.987
With all this stress you want to light
a bonfire and listen to melancholic music?

00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:19.974
Nice track.

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:24.038
Thanks.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:34.202
Remember when there were power cuts
we used to play a game in our childhood?

00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:35.464
'My dirty secret'.

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:40.112
In the darkness we would tell each other
secrets that nobody knew.

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:41.956
Yeah, I remember.

00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:46.219
I'd stolen Bunty Jaiswal's tape recorder.

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.544
I told you guys

00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:54.423
and you guys went and
told mom and dad.

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:55.688
I was beaten up.

00:05:57.508 --> 00:05:59.325
Because that was wrong Chitvan.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.000
He is taking revenge for that.

00:06:01.143 --> 00:06:03.175
Tells all of our secrets
to mom and dad.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.436
No, but you guys broke
the rule of the game.

00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:06.786
And Chanchu,

00:06:06.794 --> 00:06:08.651
the name of the game
is 'my dirty secret'.

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:10.863
It is not 'my good karma for the day',
right?

00:06:10.943 --> 00:06:11.943
Okay, sorry.

00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:13.639
Now don't cry.

00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:20.598
Should we play now?

00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:23.487
No!

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:23.940
Why?

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:26.487
You want to play
a game in this situation?

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:28.218
So what other options do you  have?

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:32.281
Okay come, your turn.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.257
Start.

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:35.799
Hey, I don't want to play any games,
ask her only.

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:36.957
Hey, come on dude.

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:38.409
Okay ladies first.

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.419
Should I start?

00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:42.577
Okay.

00:06:51.843 --> 00:06:53.462
I had sex before marriage.

00:06:53.494 --> 00:06:54.627
Hey, everyone did.

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:55.843
I mean does.

00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.851
No, I mean,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.280
right before,

00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:00.589
between my engagement and the wedding.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.190
Not with Pranav.

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:04.769
What?

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.967
Nice!

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:07.285
How is it nice?

00:07:07.412 --> 00:07:09.316
Nice or not, it happened.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.888
And anyway I am telling you guys
my secret so don't judge.

00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:15.402
Anyway...

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:19.886
So it happened at my bachelorrete party,
in Goa.

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:22.306
He was Scottish.

00:07:22.672 --> 00:07:23.672
Ooh how was it?

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:25.068
Hey, I don't want to know.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.790
It was amazing.

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:28.640
Hey, what are you guys doing man?

00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:30.387
Are you her brother or girl friend?

00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:32.744
Chill, I am not telling the details.

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:36.648
Anyway, I felt really bad later on.

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:37.656
Obviously.

00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:39.887
No, not that I had sex.

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:41.189
But,

00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:44.538
I wish...

00:07:44.752 --> 00:07:46.721
I just wish I had done
it with a black guy.

00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:47.745
Okay, that's just...

00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:49.380
Racist? Yeah.

00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:52.245
No, that's not what I meant but...

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:53.771
All right, forget it.

00:07:57.555 --> 00:07:58.585
Chanchu.

00:07:58.665 --> 00:07:59.299
Hmm?

00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:00.653
Tell me something.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.926
What did you see in Pranav?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.308
Pranav.

00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:16.328
You know when I first met Pranav.

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:18.613
He was my senior then.

00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:22.002
He used to come to college
in an open jeep.

00:08:22.657 --> 00:08:24.617
He was into wildlife photography.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:26.775
He was a member of the flying club.

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:29.204
He was really cool back then.

00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:32.402
And our interests were the same.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.625
But then when his
father passed away.

00:08:38.363 --> 00:08:40.847
They found out that
they were under a lot of debt.

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:45.693
Disputes started off in the family
regarding the property.

00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:47.847
And...

00:08:48.808 --> 00:08:51.457
It was getting difficult
to handle such a big palace

00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:55.752
So Pranav took all the responsibilities.

00:08:59.717 --> 00:09:01.137
And now he is stuck there.

00:09:03.027 --> 00:09:04.751
And you also got stuck with him.

00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:17.428
Are you crying?

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.292
It's just that...

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:25.859
I don't have anybody to talk to.

00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:30.900
If I tell mom dad,
they'll simply get worried.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.834
You settled in the US.

00:09:33.263 --> 00:09:34.890
He never picks up his calls.

00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:37.659
I am sorry I am going on like this,

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:38.676
but it is just that,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.763
if somebody sits
and hears me out then.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.616
I'll feel much better.

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:46.148
I'll be able to handle
this situation way better.

00:09:54.047 --> 00:09:55.578
You know Pranav is not a bad guy.

00:09:55.587 --> 00:09:56.721
I really love him,

00:09:56.737 --> 00:09:57.737
I do.

00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:14.269
I was in jail for three days.

00:10:18.213 --> 00:10:19.213
What?

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:22.775
I was smoking a joint outside the club.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.458
I had a really nice gig.

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:27.157
I'd got 10,000 rupees.

00:10:27.554 --> 00:10:29.125
Whoever came
and praised the gig,

00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:31.291
I offered them the joint.

00:10:33.593 --> 00:10:34.672
The seventh guy, motherfucker,

00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:35.982
turned out to be a policeman.

00:10:38.998 --> 00:10:41.244
He smoked the whole joint with me.

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:43.815
Then in for three days.

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:46.648
A 10,000 rupees fine
and back to square one.

00:10:49.673 --> 00:10:51.418
But, I befriended him.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.058
Everything is off the record,

00:10:56.075 --> 00:10:57.297
no criminal history.

00:11:02.043 --> 00:11:03.162
I'm good.

00:11:06.447 --> 00:11:07.464
Wow!

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:11.334
I don't know whether to be worried
about you or be proud of you.

00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:13.318
I am worried.

00:11:13.722 --> 00:11:15.079
Proud is a little difficult.

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.218
Fuck, you actually went to jail?

00:11:27.337 --> 00:11:28.456
Yup.

00:11:29.337 --> 00:11:31.741
This experience is
also important, Baba.

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:33.726
Arrey!

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:37.591
Okay come on, your turn now.

00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:40.638
Told you already, I got a divorce.

00:11:40.663 --> 00:11:41.242
Now what?

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:42.592
Hey, that's not fair.

00:11:42.687 --> 00:11:44.425
Baba that is no secret.

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:47.115
All the waitresses
in my club know that .

00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:49.506
Tell us a bigger secret,

00:11:49.522 --> 00:11:50.633
how many notes did you manage to

00:11:50.658 --> 00:11:51.180
extract out of the divorce?

00:11:51.205 --> 00:11:51.752
What?

00:11:51.847 --> 00:11:53.791
He earned money out
of his divorce.

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:54.648
What?

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:55.879
You got money?

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:56.966
How did you do it?

00:11:56.974 --> 00:11:57.951
Tell me even I'll try.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.047
Nothing man, his foreigner wife
was getting naughty.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.142
She got bored of brown bread.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.088
So, she was having white bread.

00:12:03.896 --> 00:12:05.078
Acha okay, come on.

00:12:05.103 --> 00:12:06.467
Time for your dirty secret.

00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:12.075
I'm afraid to sleep in the dark..

00:12:12.624 --> 00:12:14.568
Baba, there's nothing
secret in this too.

00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:16.577
Why don't you listen for once?

00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:18.371
Stop spoiling the melancholic mood!

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:19.879
Go ahead.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.570
Yeah, so I'm afraid
to sleep in the dark.

00:12:25.824 --> 00:12:27.321
I don't know why is
this happening.

00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:30.291
And the problem
exacerbated in Brooklyn.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.125
Then Paula came in my life.

00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:35.341
We worked together,
traveled together,

00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:37.693
slept together.
Everything was good.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.404
Then Paula...

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:42.189
Started coming home late.

00:12:43.595 --> 00:12:46.577
I used to lie down with the lights on.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.634
Would sleep after hearing
her open the door.

00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:55.388
Then one night she...

00:12:55.452 --> 00:12:58.113
Opened the door and I
didn't hear anything

00:13:00.034 --> 00:13:02.446
What I heard was her phone call.

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:05.676
About the details of

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:09.002
her sex life with her
boyfriend, Harvey.

00:13:14.438 --> 00:13:15.438
So, that was that.

00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:18.444
And...so...

00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:20.341
This is my dirty secret.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.375
I am afraid to
sleep in the dark.

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:28.722
The way I see it,

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.668
Your phobia saved you.

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:32.017
From that sham called marriage.

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:35.346
And made him a millionaire.

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:39.620
God should give such
problems to everyone.

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:41.245
I also want a divorce!

00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:53.088
When was the last time that we...

00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:55.366
Three of us, were
together like this?

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.545
1998.

00:14:02.212 --> 00:14:03.212
Sarojini Nagar.

00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:07.286
Right before the exams, right?

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.389
Light's out.

00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:16.581
It's quite nice, right?

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.589
Yeah, we should do this more often.

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:21.463
Yeah.

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:24.053
I always say,

00:14:24.387 --> 00:14:28.317
road trips are the solution
to all of life's problems.

00:14:31.698 --> 00:14:32.174
In fact,

00:14:33.746 --> 00:14:38.603
Fuck melancholy. I'll just
change the fucking track.

00:14:38.729 --> 00:14:41.530
Let's use Harman speakers in our Tiago.

00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:44.268
Let me show you how it's done.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.188
You sure you saw light
in this direction?

00:15:34.213 --> 00:15:34.895
Yeah!

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:37.260
Baba, I frankly
didn't see any light.

00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:38.363
Why?

00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:40.295
No one saw any light?

00:15:40.435 --> 00:15:41.435
Did you?

00:15:41.935 --> 00:15:44.775
No but you both
were so convinced...

00:15:44.816 --> 00:15:47.879
Only chanchal saw the light
but she is in depression.

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:48.744
Shut up!

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.006
Hey,

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:50.926
What is that?

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.133
Looks like a party!

00:15:52.165 --> 00:15:53.633
Let's join!

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.497
Wow!

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:02.878
They're awesome!

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:05.649
That middle-one looks like Paula.

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.419
I feel like I'm in Mad Max.

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:09.768
What a day!

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.244
What a lovely day!

00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:13.554
Gulping beer down and...

00:16:13.554 --> 00:16:15.508
Look at their perfect bodies!

00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:16.865
One minute.

00:16:16.897 --> 00:16:17.897
Get back.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.350
What?

00:16:20.373 --> 00:16:21.373
It's the heat.

00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.809
This mirage!

00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:24.842
You know them?

00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:29.212
She isn't mirage.
The English term - mirage

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.545
Oh, that helps.

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:38.125
Shalom.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.410
Hi, Shalom.

00:16:41.442 --> 00:16:42.442
I'm Chandan.

00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:43.615
Baba, shalom means hello.

00:16:43.615 --> 00:16:45.164
Wait, let me handle this.

00:16:45.282 --> 00:16:46.821
Where are you from, shalom?

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.726
From Israel.

00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:51.617
Israel, Israel!

00:16:51.728 --> 00:16:59.152
*Hebrew*

00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:00.466
Oh, nice.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.315
Come,

00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:03.800
I'll introduce you to my friends.

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:05.767
He speaks Israeli?

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.319
Israeli isn't a language, Israel is a
country and Hebrew is its language.

00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:10.351
Oh, okay.

00:17:10.399 --> 00:17:11.532
He speaks Hebrew?

00:17:11.716 --> 00:17:13.319
I don't know what he does.

00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:14.969
Might have learned
it in the jail.

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:21.100
You're slightly jealous of Chitvan, right?

00:17:21.149 --> 00:17:22.149
Of course not.

00:17:28.154 --> 00:17:30.360
Maybe a little.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.138
Come.

00:17:33.894 --> 00:17:34.999
This is Yaile.

00:17:35.077 --> 00:17:35.775
Hi, Yaile

00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:36.498
Hi.

00:17:36.601 --> 00:17:38.057
That is Ruqsana.

00:17:38.173 --> 00:17:39.173
Hi!

00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:40.933
Tanya.

00:17:41.774 --> 00:17:43.123
Hi, Tanya.
How are you?

00:17:43.282 --> 00:17:44.512
Very nice to meet you.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.774
They know the way.

00:17:46.147 --> 00:17:48.242
These sweeties will take
us to the service station.

00:17:48.266 --> 00:17:51.456
We'll check on the car
and on our hunger.

00:17:52.156 --> 00:17:53.274
I've talked to them.

00:17:53.307 --> 00:17:55.973
Listen, now I'll tell
you what the plan is.

00:17:56.148 --> 00:17:59.489
I'll go to the service
station with them in the van

00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:01.712
And you come with
Chanchal in Tiago

00:18:01.712 --> 00:18:02.712
Baba.

00:18:03.927 --> 00:18:06.252
I'll eat the fruit when
I planted the seeds.

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.535
You guys follow us in the Tiago.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.517
Babies, you follow me.

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:11.599
Come.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.117
Nice shirt.

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:37.539
All okay?

00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:38.906
Yeah

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.554
Thank you for helping us get here.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:49.910
So now?

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.070
Now, we should go...

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:54.125
Long way.

00:18:55.172 --> 00:18:56.172
Yes...

00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:02.053
Chotu, where's the bathroom?

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:02.823
Up.

00:19:02.855 --> 00:19:03.855
Oh, up.
Okay.

00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:05.356
Come, I'll show you.

00:19:05.387 --> 00:19:06.847
No, I'll go.

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.133
I also go.

00:19:08.244 --> 00:19:10.122
Oh, you also... okay.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.450
One second.

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:23.289
Come.

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:24.345
Yeah.

00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:28.993
Thank you.

00:19:36.955 --> 00:19:38.272
Thank you.

00:19:41.622 --> 00:19:42.995
Whoa! What are you doing?

00:19:46.398 --> 00:19:49.013
5 minutes? Listen, shoshan.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:49.922
Shoshana.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.389
Shoshana, not here.
Not this, please.

00:19:52.395 --> 00:19:52.942
No?

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.958
No.

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.654
-Oh,Indian.
-Indian, yes.

00:19:59.687 --> 00:20:01.178
No waste time.

00:20:01.202 --> 00:20:02.170
Waste time, sorry?

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.341
Okay, no problem but more money.

00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:05.990
More...money?

00:20:06.022 --> 00:20:08.648
Chitvan paid this for you.

00:20:08.728 --> 00:20:10.410
No problem but more money

00:20:10.482 --> 00:20:13.704
One minute... Communication problem.
Chitvan gave you money for this?

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:23.301
Let me just have a word with
Chitvan and I'll be back.

00:20:23.452 --> 00:20:27.639
I'm so sorry about this.
I'll be back in a...

00:20:32.668 --> 00:20:33.668
Bawa?

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.528
You paid her to do
all that with me?

00:20:36.597 --> 00:20:39.190
Baba, how does it matter who paid?

00:20:39.246 --> 00:20:40.513
You had fun, right?

00:20:41.147 --> 00:20:42.147
Bastard!

00:20:42.678 --> 00:20:44.292
I thought it will happen
this time because

00:20:44.318 --> 00:20:45.630
she reminded you
of naughty bhabhi.

00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:46.575
What do you mean?

00:20:46.607 --> 00:20:48.948
That Payal too?

00:20:49.379 --> 00:20:50.379
Yeah.

00:20:51.189 --> 00:20:52.101
Asshole!

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:52.950
Baba...

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:54.998
That food place chic too?

00:20:55.094 --> 00:20:57.617
A little incentive
is needed, Baba.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:02.197
You ass, you stay there!
I'll get you!

00:21:02.482 --> 00:21:04.393
What are you doing, Baba?

00:21:04.403 --> 00:21:05.489
You'll get hurt.

00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:06.689
Baba!

00:21:07.842 --> 00:21:09.509
Baba, this is wrong.

00:21:13.144 --> 00:21:14.678
Baba, I'm a hard hitter.

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:17.214
I'm telling you.
You'll get hurt.

00:21:21.972 --> 00:21:23.638
Baba, don't you abuse me!

00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:28.134
Stop choking me, dumbass...

00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:34.999
Baba, I was worried about you

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.394
Baba has become a monster.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.961
You betrayed me!

00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:43.866
Your car...

00:21:48.994 --> 00:21:49.994
What the fuck!

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.477
What non-sense is this!

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.056
Did Chanchal  take it?

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.047
I doubted her since childhood.

00:21:57.634 --> 00:21:59.966
You look like a thief!
How can you doubt me?

00:22:00.388 --> 00:22:02.181
I was watching your pansy fight.

00:22:02.475 --> 00:22:05.342
Who took the Tiago when
all of us are here?

00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:08.461
RV isn't here too!

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.950
Oh shit!

00:22:10.253 --> 00:22:11.253
Oh fuck!

00:22:14.276 --> 00:22:16.013
Baba, I'm so sorry
