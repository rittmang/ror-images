"To beyond the ground,

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:11.841
"The call has come
to go to the distant land."

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:18.641
"We've again come back after so long."

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:40.361
"Our father-in-law
stays in the forest."

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:50.641
"Our father-in-law
stays in the forest."

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:57.401
"His age is 88."

00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:04.681
"His age is 88."

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:15.681
"That's why we are the kings now."

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:29.601
"Gopi Bagha kings of Shundi kingdom."

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:46.361
"But the sorrow of
becoming the king.."

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:55.521
"Let me tell you now.
There's nothing to hide in that."

00:02:55.601 --> 00:03:06.401
"Listen. Your heart will
be filled amidst nature."

00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:12.841
"Your heart will be
filled amidst nature."

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:22.841
"Time doesn't pass
sitting on the throne."

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:33.081
"Disgusting.
Disgusting. Let's leave all this."

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.521
"We can't remain caged anymore."

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:45.441
"We both. We brothers
must go out of this cage."

00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:49.801
"Our days don't pass anymore."

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:58.641
"We've again come back after so long."

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:05.721

00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:19.401
"We've more to say. More to say."

00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.801
"Where we'll go and
what's the reason?"

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:26.881
"Where we'll go and
what's the reason?"

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:40.481
"Far away from here,
far away from here."

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:43.481
"In the west, to Anandapur."

00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:50.121
"In the west,
in Anandapur king's court magic show."

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:54.401
"We've been called
to the magic show there."

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:56.841
"We've been called for that."

00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:03.881
"We agreed instantly.
Agreed instantly."

00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:10.681
"We can do magic by ghost's boon."

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:16.841

00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:26.641
"Everyone says wow.
It's a lot of fun. Lot of fun."

00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:30.881
"We've again come back after so long."

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.281
"We've again come back after so long."

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:40.641
"We've come again. We've come again."

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.090
Listen, Brahmananda.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.130
Command, Lord.
Today's my farewell day. You command me.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.170
You command this disciple of yours.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.570
You know I'm impressed by your duty.
- I know, Lord.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.330
I've transferred my power into you.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.250
I've even taught you
the power to hypnotise.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.770
But remember,
using that power is a sin.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.050
Your command, Lord. But I expect more.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.970
You want to be immortal, right?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.250
Yes, my Lord. Your guess is correct.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.450
But I'll not fulfil that wish.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.690
Why Lord? What's my fault?

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.570
You still couldn't let your greed go.
You still want wealth.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.010
In your youth,
the wealth you had collected..

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.250
I've come to know that
you still haven't let go of that.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.050
That's true, Lord. I admit.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.370
I also know you had
killed many people.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.770
And didn't get any punishment yet.
So, you won't be immortal.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.610
Death isn't any fake thing.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.930
How will I die, Lord?

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.370
No illness can kill you.
- Then?

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.410
The cause of your death
will be a twelve-year-old boy.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:45.130
Boy? That's absurd.
Are you joking, Lord?

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.170
I've crossed 100,
but no illness has touched me.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.290
My count is correct.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.530
Where does that boy live?

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:03.970
In Anandapur, by river Gahona.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.690
What's that boy's name?
- Bikram.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.010
Will he kill me?
- No, he's harmless.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.370
Then?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.370
I can't say more than this.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.770
But when will I die?
You won't say even that, Lord?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.210
The day your wealth gets over,
and you'll be penniless..

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.290
Understand that death
is knocking on your door.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.810
But what if I can defeat everybody?

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.970
What you couldn't do in 40 years,
can you do that now?

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.130
No, you can't.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.010
You've anything else to ask?

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.010
No, Lord.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.010
Then you may go now.
- Okay, as you command, Lord.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.410
"In a day we,
both left our homes and came outside."

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.130
"In a day we,
both left our homes and came outside."

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:26.370
"Finally, we both left
our homes and came outside."

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.850
"We're perfect together."

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.810
"Gopi-Bagha. We're perfect together."

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.370
"Gopi-Bagha. We're perfect together."

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.730
"You won't find perfect
partners like us."

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.490
"You won't find perfect
partners like us."

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.370
"Whatever we do, we do together."

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.730
"By that our friendship deepens."

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.330
"Whatever we do, we do together."

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.330
"By that our friendship deepens."

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.170
"20 years have passed so amazingly."

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.170
"20 years have passed so amazingly."

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.770
"Finally, we both left
our homes and came outside."

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.810
"That's why we forget all
worries and sing songs again."

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:56.490
"We walk,
we see, we listen, we learn."

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:04.130
"We walk,
we see, we listen, we learn."

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.290
"Walking so long, seeing so much."

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.210
"Listening so many things,
learning so much."

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.570
"All unknown has got wiped."

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.770
"All unknown has got wiped."

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:23.050
"We're now very intelligent.
Very intelligent."

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.490
"Finally, we both left
our homes and came outside."

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:37.250
"That's why we forget all
worries and sing songs again."

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.930
"Sing songs again. Sing songs again."

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.490
You know Gopinath,
we can't walk so much at this age.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.450
Moreover, my drum weighs a lot.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.570
Though we talk about
walking in our songs.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.690
We can talk about walking
because it's a song of fun.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.370
Well-known people
have said it correctly.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.410
Age doesn't stop for anyone.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.450
You know what I feel?
I wish we could stay young all life.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.570
But this is far better
than sitting at home.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.250
Hundred percent better.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.370
If we've to go home,
we'll clap and go.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.610
And we'll again clap and return.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.530
Brother Bagha,
I've heard Anandapur is a nice place.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.530
Tomorrow is the challenge.
- Yes.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.410
We'll go in a minute.
- Yes. But one thing.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.530
We're kings. We'll not get into challenges.
- Correct.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:13.250
But if the king insists,
then we'll show a couple of tricks.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.530
Or maybe we can sing a song.
But no challenge.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.530
Yes. After becoming kings,
that addiction is gone.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.250
Correct.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:54.530
Now, magic show will start.
I'll call each magician by name.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.730
He'll stand here and
show his magic trick.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:06.570
It'll go on like this.
First, Gulam Mustafa Mohammed Aba.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.730
Good.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.290
Magic show ends.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.490
Your songs are of immense fame.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.730
Not only song,
we know magic also very well.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.690
But we're kings, so,
we don't participate in magic shows.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:59.650
If you show few of your tricks,
and sing a song for us..

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.210
..we'll be very happy.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.690
Okay. Sure, sure.
- Where's my drum?

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.130
Give, give. Go.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.650
We're telling one thing,
everybody listen.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.050
This time the magic trick
will be little different.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.690
First, we'll vanish.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.530
Shundi.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.490
Now, another magic. Change of dress.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.690
Halla's dress!

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.850
British!

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.010
Hermit!

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.410
Naga!

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.490
Bedouin!

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.490
Adab.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.530
Soldier!

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.490
As we were..

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.730
Now. a song. Everybody sings songs.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.490
But this song turns listeners
into motionless stones.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.450
When we sing, all will understand.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.490
Now, do we sing?

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:25.570
"To everyone present here,
we join our hands and greet."

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.050
"We join our hands and greet."

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.690
"This is the starting of our song."

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.570
"This is the starting of our song."

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.930
"Our hearts pound."

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.770
"Our hearts pound."

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.930
"If our song doesn't work.
If our song doesn't work.."

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:12.770
"This is our fear. This is our fear."

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.410
"But seeing, as far as we understand."

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:36.330
"But seeing, as far as we understand."

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.570
"The tune of our song has worked."

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:47.570
"The tune of our song has worked."

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:54.210
"Nobody moves. Nobody moves."

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:10.450
"Nobody's eyelashes wink.
Nobody's eyelashes wink."

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:19.770
"Wow. Wow.
All around, we see stone statues."

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.970
"All around, we see stone statues."

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:34.530
"This is our biggest magic."

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:46.810
"Now, everyone in this
court shall praise. Praise."

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:52.450
Good, good.
- Amazing, amazing. Amazing.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:59.410
Amazing, amazing. Amazing.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.810
Amazing.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:09.530
You've amazing powers.
From where did you get it?

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.610
Let me introduce you.
He's Brahmananda Acharya.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.730
Recently, he has come
here for his health matters.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.570
A very good and knowledgeable man.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.650
Hello, Acharya sir.
- Hello.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.730
It was nice meeting you.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.530
Very nice.
- But the answer to my question?

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.610
That's a long story.
We'll tell you someday later.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.610
Why later? Come tomorrow.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.450
I'm extremely curious
to listen to your story.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.570
Where do you stay?

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.490
He stays in a portion
of the Anandagarh fort.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.250
Very old fort.
But a portion is still habitable.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.410
I'm a lonely man, I've no problems.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.650
Remember it, Gopinath.
- Anandagarh.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.490
When will we go?
- It's good if it's sunset.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.410
What if it's ten o'clock?
- Excellent.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.650
I'll send someone with you,
to take you.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.610
No, no, Your Majesty. We'll clap and go.
- Clap and go.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.410
Ten o'clock.
- Yes, ten o'clock.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.650
Master.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.850
Why so much of delay?

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.050
No drinks, no smoke.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.370
This dearth of servants
is intolerable.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.610
Cook, you, and two security personnel,
is it enough?

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.490
Dirt all around.
No one to clean. Why is it so?

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.210
Getting a servant here
is very difficult, master.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.250
Everyone goes in the
name of working in the fort.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.410
But you don't worry, master.
I'll manage everything by myself.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.490
Give me a few days time.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.690
Anyway, what's the
reason of your delay?

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.610
Actually, I had to go around
the entire town home-to-home.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.370
Searching, that's why, master.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.690
What is the result?

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.690
Thirteen boys were found.
Name. Bikram. Age. Twelve.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.650
What's the arrangement
of bringing them here?

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.570
What? Have to bring them here?

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.450
Then why did I ask you to search?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:11.410
But.. - Illiterate.
You'll go from house-to-house.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.650
And say that Acharya is
very affectionate towards boys.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:21.690
His own son's name was Bikram.
He died at twelve.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:29.450
So, he is inviting every
boy by this name in Anandapur.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:35.570
There's food for everyone.
And a gift too.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.970
These boys come to play
at the ground in the evening.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.010
Will I tell them then?
- Yes, say.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.330
Say that this arrangement
is only for them, not their parents.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.610
They shouldn't say
anything prior at home.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.450
They'll take the gift
and then show their parents.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.610
These boys love me a lot.
My one word..

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.410
Hello.
- Come, come, you both.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:15.370
I'm calling you this way
as I'm much elder to you by age.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.410
Okay, okay.
- As you say.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.490
You go. Bring some
drinks for three of us.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:21.850
Okay, master.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.450
Sit, sit. Sit here.
- Yes.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.610
You stay alone in this fort?
- I'm used to loneliness.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:37.290
I'm alone. I've no relatives.
- You must be sad?

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.690
No. I'm uninteresting.
This is only my way of life.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.570
You look like an emperor.
Isn't it, Gopinath? - Yes, correct.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.410
Let my topic be. Tell me about you.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.410
Where did you get
this amazing power from?

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.450
I'll say?
- Say. I'm there.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:02.330
Acharya sir, we both were village boys.
- Very poor.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.410
I used to sing very badly,
and he used to play the drum.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.530
Very badly.
- You were in the same village?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.450
No, no. I am in Amloki.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:11.690
And I am from Hortuki.
- Hortuki.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.210
We met later.
- Okay. Say.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.690
Then one day,
my village king threw me out.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.410
And his turned him out too.
- Turned me out.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.650
We met in a bamboo forest.
- There was a group of ghosts.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.250
And the ghosts had a king.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.530
He became happy and
granted us three boons.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.650
Why? Why was he happy?

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.610
We are good, that's why.
- We are poor. That's why.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.970
One boon for food.
- Food?

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.450
Yes. Yes, Acharya sir.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.810
Want to see? What food to ask for?

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.370
Sweets.
- Yes.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.490
Sweets!

00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:13.370
Amazing.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.210
Is it edible?
- Yes, Acharya. Very good sweet.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.770
Taste a bit.
- Take.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.290
Eat.
- Take. Eat.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.050
Taste and see.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.170
See.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.490
Truly, very good. But so many sweets.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.370
Keep it. You can have them slowly.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.810
It won't rot.
Sweet of boon, that's why.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.770
Then?
- Yes, I was saying..

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.050
Number one.
We can dress and eat whatever we want.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.730
Secondly, we can go anywhere we want.
- How?

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.810
Why? Shoes. We wear them.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.690
These are magic shoes.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.490
We wear them,
name the place, and clap.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.850
And we reach in fraction of a second.
- Yes.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:39.650
Understood.
- And third boon is of music and singing.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.050
You saw how everyone turned
into a stone when we sang.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:13.210
I saw everyone turning into
stone listening to your song.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:18.090
But did you see me?
- We didn't see separately.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.170
I didn't turn into stone.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.170
What?

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.650
You didn't turn into stone?
- No.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.730
You're not human?
- Seeing me, what do you feel?

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:44.010
What? No.
- Then? Even you are humans.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.890
If you can have extraordinary powers,
why can't I? What?

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:56.930
Pardon me,
Acharya, but this seems unbelievable.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.610
No. We don't believe.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:04.010
Okay. Check and see. See.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.490
"The ghost king gives boons.
Good, good three boons."

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.050
"Whatever we want to wear.."

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.170
What?

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.970
Now, do you believe?

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.890
Our eyes are popping out.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:40.050
I was the disciple of a spirit,
and served him for 40 years.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:45.410
He was impressed and gave
me his supernatural powers.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.290
Oh, that's why you
can't be hypnotized?

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:55.170
Yes. But I have the
power to hypnotize others.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.490
Wow.
- Let's see, hypnotize us.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.450
I will do if needed.

00:32:03.687 --> 00:32:05.330
That's what.
- Yeah.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:12.330
Shankhapur, Kanchanpur, Bishalnagar.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.570
Have you heard of these kingdoms?

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.170
No, we haven't.
- We haven't learnt geography.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.370
What's there?

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.490
The kings of these three kingdoms
have three gems. On their heads.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.050
No one in India has those types.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.570
I want those.
- Oh, you collect gems?

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:44.530
Oh, these are genuine gems.
Where did you get so many?

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:50.530
There was way, in the past.
Now, there isn't. But you have.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:56.450
You know magic. You can
use two boons to get this done.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:01.170
Say, can you get
the three stones for me?

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.770
What? You'll be prized for it.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.330
We don't have greed, Acharya.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:15.370
And we are kings,
so, we don't need prize.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.530
What's your age?

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.250
Age?

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.250
It'll be 40, isn't it?
- Yes, yes.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.290
Age gives troubles,
which you know about. Is it good?

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.530
Little illness we have..
- We aren't young anymore.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:44.170
What if you could turn young
like before? Strong and fit?

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:50.450
Not bad.
- We've talked about this, Acharya.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:56.370
But age doesn't reduce.
- It does reduce. I know.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:04.570
I know the way.
My teacher had taught me.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.770
I'll reduce your age by 20 years.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.490
If in these three days,
you can get me those three gems.

00:34:16.734 --> 00:34:19.450
We don't do wrong, Acharya.
- No, we don't.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:26.530
Why will you do? You'll go
in disguise. I'll do the make-up.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.610
No one will recognise
you as Gopinath and Baghanath.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.930
Disguise? Then people won't blame us.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.330
No. No reason.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.050
You'll reduce our age by 20 years?

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:44.330
Brahmananda Acharya doesn't lie.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:50.210
Can we both whisper?
- Say.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.250
You won't get angry?
- No.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.570
Acharya, we need two days time.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.330
We'll decide in two days.
- Only two days, not more.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.570
No, no. Day after tomorrow,
we'll come to you.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:14.210
Wednesday, ten o'clock.
- Okay, that's fixed.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.210
Then, do we leave, Acharya?
- Go.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.330
Ok.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.330
Palace!

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:05.410
What to do?
- The work isn't good, Brother Bagha.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.530
No one will recognise us,
we'll be disguised.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:15.370
It is goose-bump adventure.
Blood is getting hot.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:19.810
And don't forget, he'll make us young.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.010
That's the problem.
That's what makes us greedy.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.250
But that's right. If we agree..

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.810
..he'll first hypnotise us.
- Why?

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.810
If we get the gems and elope,
not giving him..

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.330
But we don't do things like that,
Brother Bagha.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.330
He doesn't know us.
He'll hypnotise us.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:49.250
But we also have powers.
Why will we get hypnotised?

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:53.250
If we become?
Who knows? We know nothing.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:10.450
One knows. One knows.
Only one knows. Surely knows.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:15.530
Who? Who knows?
- The one who gave us the boons.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.610
Ghost king. Correct.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.450
But is he still alive?
- Illiterate.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.170
He has become a ghost after death.
Why will he die again?

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.210
Then let's go, and ask him.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.410
But do you remember
the name of the village?

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.290
Where the bamboo forest was?

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.610
Yes. Notungaon.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:44.330
Notungaon. Notungaon's bamboo forest.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:02.170
That bamboo forest.
- Yes, yes.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:07.370
How do we call him?
- Call him king. What else?

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.770
There's no other king here.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:13.290
Okay. Brother Bagha, you won't call?

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.570
You call.
Any one calling will work. Okay.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.330
Your Majesty!

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:26.570
Your Majesty!

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.650
Not like that. Not like that.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.170
Isn't he the king?

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:39.330
Kneel down, join your hands, and call.
- Oh, okay.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.170
"Gopi Bagha. Gopi Bagha."

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:54.530
"Gopi Bagha. Gopi Bagha."

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.090
"I remember everything, I remember."

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.370
"I haven't forgotten anything.
I haven't."

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.450
Bagha.
- He has answered.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.130
"You two kings,
King Gopi, King Bagha."

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:09.970
"King Gopi, King Bagha."

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:14.450
"I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy."

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.410
Your Majesty,
it's wonderful seeing and meeting you.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.210
All the memories are rushing back.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.250
"Why are you back?
First, let me hear it."

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.490
"Let me hear it. Let me hear it."

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.370
Your Majesty,
we want to ask you something.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.970
We have something to know.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:41.170
"What's it? Ask. Ask. Ask fast."

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.570
Your Majesty, can anyone hypnotise us?
- Yes?

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.450
"If you want,
then you'll get hypnotised."

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:54.370
"But if you don't want,
then never, never."

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.450
Hearing this reply, we're very happy.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.450
We can't explain.
- Very happy.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.290
"But one warning.
Listen, know and remember."

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:09.330
"Stars aren't good.
The time isn't good."

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:15.210
"Be on track. On track, on track."

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.690
"Good Gopi, good Bagha.
Good Gopi, good Bagha.."

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.610
"Have to be, have to be, have to be."

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.650
"I'm going. I'm going. I'm going."

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:31.410
"I'm going. I'm going. I'm going."

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.370
"I'm going. I'm going. I'm going."

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.370
Master.
- What news?

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.290
All 13 are here, master.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.970
All thirteen's name is Bikram?
- Yes, master.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.090
All thirteen are twelve years old?
- Yes, master.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.330
I've enquired.
Except them, there's no other Bikram.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:17.290
Who is twelve years old in this town?

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.410
Their parents don't know, right?

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.250
No, master.
They were playing in the ground.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.850
Their school is closed today.
I went there and shouted.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.370
How many Bikrams are
here amongst you all?

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:35.330
19 came forward. I told
only twelve year olds to be here.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.210
And who aren't, go back. 13remained.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.530
Then I told them exactly
what you told me to.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.210
They heard about the invitation,
and the toy gift.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.930
And agreed instantly to come with me.
Instantly.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.250
Take them to the room. I'm coming.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.250
Okay, master. Now..

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:03.330
Now what?
- A stone, master. A gem.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:10.410
You had told me if I could
do your work, and keep it secret..

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.570
..you'll reward me with a gem.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.250
Greedy!

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:18.330
Work this way for two years.
Then talk about gems.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.370
Go. Go and do what I've told you.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.490
Where have you got us?
- I'm scared.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.490
Told you would give us toys, food.
- Leave us.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.850
We'll go home.
- I'm scared.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.330
Me too.
- Leave us.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.490
Shut up.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:33.210
Dambaru! Dundubi! Go out.
- As you command, master.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:18.410
Dhonka!

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:44.490
Hail the devil.
- Hail the devil.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:50.410
We are your servants.
- We are your servants.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.530
Whatever you command us to.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.450
Whatever you command us to.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:46:02.450
We'll obey that.
- We'll obey that.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.930
We won't obey anyone else's command.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.490
We won't obey anyone else's command.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.530
Master?

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.450
Are you sure there isn't
anymore twelve year old..

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.170
..Bikram in Anandapur?

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.850
They are either 11, or 13.
I can't be wrong.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:31.330
Then I'm in peace.

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.290
Why master? What was your worry?

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.210
That I've to tell you?
Are you my master, or servant?

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.210
Servant, my master.
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.570
Take them to the room.

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.250
From now, they'll work as my servants.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.410
Their clothes are ready.
- I know, master.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:01.210
Listen, you go to your room with him.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.730
Suddenly why are we called?
- Don't know, Your Majesty.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.410
The king just told
me to call you both.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.330
Come, come.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.250
Hello, Your Majesty.
- Hello.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:10.290
I'm sorry to disturb you this way.
You were resting,

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.450
No, no. Tell me, tell me.
- Tell us what you want to.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:20.410
What will I say? There's a big trouble.
- What trouble?

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.170
These are all my subjects.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:31.490
Priest, doctor, teacher.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:37.330
Weaver, farmer. And many more.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.890
Pradeep!
- Your Majesty?

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.330
You only say about your trouble.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.210
Come. Come here.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:00.450
Pradeep has a school.
- Oh, say.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:06.530
This is a strange happening.
What do I say? Unbelievable.

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.170
Oh, let us hear what it is.
- Say, say.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.770
We all have sons.
And they all are twelve years old.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.170
And name is Bikram.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:18.770
They all are Bikram?
- Yes.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:20.210
Absurd.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:26.410
It has a reason.
My father's name was Bikram.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.210
He has done a lot for Anandapur.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:39.970
Credit for Anandapur's
goodness goes to my father.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.170
People respected him like God.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.610
So, today also many parents..

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.490
..name their sons Bikram.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.490
Okay, understood.
- Then? Say.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.650
Sons of all 13 of us are
missing from this afternoon.

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:07.570
We searched a lot,
but couldn't trace them.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.690
They aren't disobedient, or restless.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.610
Is there any fair,
play, or circus, magic going on?

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.490
They don't go anywhere
without parent's consent.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:27.250
Strange.
- Absurd.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.290
You've saved people
from danger many times.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.410
The stories of Halla
and Hirok everyone knows here.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:39.290
I was telling,
if you look into our problem too.

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.410
This is our request.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:46.170
We will, we will. Surely.
- When we're here, we'll do.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.450
You'll do?

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:58.090
"Uselessly why do you worry?
There's nothing to worry."

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:03.970
"Uselessly why do you worry?
There's nothing to worry."

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.170
"We both are there, close to you."

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.890
"If anything happens, know it well."

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:17.730
"We don't get scared of any danger."

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.450
"We don't get scared of any danger."

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:26.250
"Uselessly why do you worry?
There's nothing to worry."

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.330
"We're great because
of ghost king's boon."

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:36.810
"We're great because
of ghost king's boon."

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.850
"Our powers are many because of that."

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:43.050
"Our powers are many because of that."

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:54.130
"That's why we both,
together, rush when we see any wrong."

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.490
"That's why I'm saying
there's no danger."

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.090
"We show the devil a defeat sign."

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:18.930
"Go home and sit. Don't worry at all."

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:25.250
"Know that we never boast.
Know that we never boast."

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:33.690
"Uselessly why do you worry?
There's nothing to worry."

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:39.930
"Uselessly why do you worry?
There's nothing to worry."

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:46.530
Not finding a clue of this new danger,
Brother Bagha.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:53.410
Brother Bagha! Did you listen what I said?
- Listening.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:59.170
So, say something.
- I'm thinking something else.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:03.290
What?
- We couldn't be young.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.810
Why?

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.330
You don't understand?
Ghost king told us to be honest.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:13.410
And every path is not straight.
- Then do we reply him a no?

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:15.170
What other way do we have?

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:18.970
What regret.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.250
This chance of becoming young is gone?

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.530
And no one would've recognized us.

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:27.450
If we would've stolen
the gems in disguise..

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:31.410
Let's go.
- We'll go now?

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:34.370
The faster, the better.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.450
We'll say no, so why to wait two days?

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:40.570
Come, come, come.
- Come.

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:12.170
Seven boys.
- Yes.

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:14.450
But where are the other six?

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.170
Must be somewhere else
in the fort. Working.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:25.450
How dangerous.
- Acharya is such a cruel man.

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:29.370
He shouldn't be spared.
- No.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.210
Listen, no talks here.
Let's go back to the riverside.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:37.370
Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.410
Did you get any idea?

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:54.170
No. Brain is also old. Takes time.

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:59.170
Correctly said.
Before ideas used to come instantly..

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.250
No. We have to get young.

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:07.450
Correctly. The simultaneous
thought came to my mind.

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:12.570
Brother Bagha.
If we've to give back thirteen sons..

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:18.450
..to thirteen fathers,
we've to get into Acharya's trap.

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:25.210
There's no other way. Okay, think this way.
- Say.

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.450
To help so many people,
if we have to stoop, we will.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.810
We've to walk in the wrong way.

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:33.370
And in disguise.
No one will recognise.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.410
And after three days, we'll get out.
- And we'll be young.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:39.930
But how will you teach him a lesson?

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.450
We've to think of a way out.
You don't worry about that.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:49.250
And listen, if he tries
to hypnotise us, we'll pretend.

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:54.010
He has hypnotised all those boys.
- Yes, like puppets.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:57.370
We'll also pretend like puppets.
He won't understand.

00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:59.490
Not only he,
but no one will get any hint.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:03.410
One thing.
- What?

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:11.530
Will we tell the school
teacher that we saw his son?

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:14.210
Who? Pradeep?
- Yes.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.690
Don't have to tell now.
- Won't say?

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:18.410
He'll be upset if he gets
to know his son is hypnotised.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:23.450
Correct. - Let us first save them,
and punish Acharya.

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:30.210
Wow!

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.090
Who's singing?

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:37.530
Sweet voice.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:51.410
"How the shepherd plays.."

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:56.410
"..the flute in the fields."

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:06.370
Come close. Come, come.
- Come. Come.

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:17.450
Who are you?
What's your name, brother?

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:19.850
What's your name?
- Kanu.

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:22.570
That's your nickname.

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:26.330
You surely have a good name?
- Wait, I'm saying.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:30.010
Your good name is Kanai.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.410
Then Krishna. Right?

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.410
This is my good name.
I don't have any more names.

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.370
Oh. Now, do we tell our names?

00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:44.170
He is Gopi Gayen.
- And he is Bagha Bayen.

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:48.810
You are kings?
- Yes, yes. We are kings of Shundi.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.410
How do you know? We didn't tell you.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:55.410
I know. Grandpa told me.
Stories of Halla, Hirok.

00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:58.850
You know that also?

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:01.170
You sing, and he plays the drum.

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:05.970
Even you sing very well.
- Who teaches you?

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:09.890
Grandpa.
- Your father isn't there?

00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:16.370
Mother? Mother is there?
- Only grandpa?

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:25.330
Want to have guava? Take. Have.
- Whose guava is it?

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:29.250
I took it from the tree.
Now, I'm giving to you. - Whose tree?

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:32.690
That I don't know.
There, beside the mosque.

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:34.290
From the garden.
- Yes.

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:37.090
Uncle Karim's tree.

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:40.730
We don't know.
We are new here. Take. Take the guava.

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.530
Why? You don't eat guava?
- I eat.

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:47.330
Then why aren't you taking?

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.130
How can I eat without
telling uncle Karim?

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:56.130
Oh, God.
- Oh, God. You are a very nice guy.

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.890
We weren't so good.
At your age, we used to steal.

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.530
And have mangoes,
berries, and jackfruit.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:07.010
You'll sing?
- Can I sing your song? - Sing.

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:18.250
"How the shepherd plays
the flute in the fields."

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:28.810
"How the shepherd plays
the flute in the fields."

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:41.090
"That tune has some magic
that intoxicates my heart."

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:51.810
"How the shepherd plays
the flute in the fields.."

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:58.130
"Under the tree shade,
sitting on the ground."

01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:03.330
"Times sweeps away in the tune."

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:08.850
"Under the tree shade,
sitting on the ground."

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:13.730
"Times sweeps away in the tune."

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:19.050
"When the sun sets
behind the fields.."

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:24.210
"No attention to that."

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:34.250
"How the shepherd plays
the flute in the fields.."

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.810
So? How was it?

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:42.490
Good. But you're really kings?

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.170
Why? You don't believe?

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:48.930
You're sitting on the grass.
Kings don't sit on the grass.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:55.050
We sit. - We sit on the grass,
and on the throne too.

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.530
I'm going. Grandpa is alone.

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:00.370
Go, go.
- Go.

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:02.610
Let's go.

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.250
Oh, God.
Thank God his name isn't Bikram.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:12.330
Otherwise he would've taken him also.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.930
Then made him sweep the floor.
- Massage his legs.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:20.250
Anyway, now, no more talks.
We'll go to the fort.

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:23.170
And tell Acharya that
we agree to his offer.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:25.730
Whatever, we'll become young at least.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:43.410
Who?

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:49.170
Come, Pradeep. Come. Sit, sit.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:57.370
Why are you looking so upset?
- You didn't hear anything?

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.410
No. What's it?

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:04.450
13 boys. Everyone's name Bikram.
Age twelve.

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:07.330
Missing from today afternoon.
- What?

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:14.490
I've turned numb with worry.
- I know. I know where they are.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.730
You shouldn't talk
amidst elders, dear.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:19.450
What do you know, Kanu?

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:22.410
Since today morning
he's saying like this.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.210
Actually, he has heard
a lot of fairytales from me.

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:30.450
So, he's creating his own
fairytales in his imagination.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.210
Grandpa doesn't know. I know.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.850
Okay. Then you only say what you know.

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:43.010
There's a monster here.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.410
Where?
- In the fort.

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:48.250
In Anandagarh fort?
- Yes.

01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:53.610
He has captured those thirteen boys.
- What are you saying?

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:55.410
Heard?

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.170
Dear, do you know
who stays in the fort?

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.410
Acharya.

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:07.330
Brahmananda Acharya.
He's a very good man.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:09.930
Why will he be a monster?

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:16.450
Who's it?
- I'm Dasharathi.

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:19.490
Pradeep Pandit wants to meet you once.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.170
Okay, you go.
- Okay.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:30.330
Come.

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:38.250
Tell what the matter is.
- Sorry to disturb you at an odd hour.

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:40.370
No, no, no.
It's okay. Tell what the matter is.

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.290
I had a question.
- What?

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.410
Do you know Acharya?

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:50.530
Yes, we know.
- According to you, how is he as a person?

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:57.850
I mean to ask... Actually,
last month when he came here..

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:01.370
..he gifted a gem each
to all the town heads.

01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:04.410
He wanted to give me too,
but I didn't take it.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:12.170
I felt it was nothing but absurd.
I feel he isn't a nice man.

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.210
Should I say?
- Say, there's no harm.

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:20.290
What?

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:24.690
I mean, your son is
there in Acharya's house.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.130
With the other twelve.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:31.210
This... this, you know?
- Yes, we know.

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:36.290
Acharya has hypnotised them.
They work as his servants.

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:40.570
Acharya is the disciple of a devil.
He has various powers.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.210
Even our times are getting dark.

01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:46.090
But what's the reason
of kidnapping twelve Bikrams?

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.250
I find no logic behind it.
- Even we don't know.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:51.410
No, we don't.

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:54.410
I won't get my son back?

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:58.410
You won't, in this condition.
You believe us.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:04.410
I don't believe. I don't believe.
I'm going to the fort now.

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:09.690
Listen, listen.
There's guard at the fort door.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:14.690
How will you get in? - You can't take me
inside the fort? Can't you?

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:22.250
We can. We can hug you,
clap, and take you.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:24.290
But you won't get your son back.

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.250
It's unbelievable. It can't be.

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.530
My son won't recognise me,
that's impossible.

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.290
I beg at your feet, please take me.

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:40.850
Let's go. But we can't solve
it in a rush. That I'm telling you.

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:35.290
Bikram! Bikram! Bikram! Bikram!

01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:44.250
I'm your father.

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:50.450
You can't recognise me? Let's go.
I've come to take you. Bikram.

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:55.530
Get up. Let's go.
Let's go. We'll elope from here.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:08:01.410
Let's go.
Let's go, Bikram. Let's go. Bikram.

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:06.690
Bikram. Bikram.

01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:31.450
Listen, tomorrow,
we're coming here again.

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:37.490
Acharya has given us a work.
We'll need three days to do.

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:42.450
Within three days,
we'll find a way to rescue your son.

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:47.770
Now, let's go. Come. Come.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:13.770
Hello, Acharya.
- Welcome. Welcome.

01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:19.690
We've come as we had said.
- We don't' change our words.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:21.410
Sunrise. Ten o'clock.

01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:23.290
What have you decided?

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.250
One thing, Acharya.
- Say, say.

01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:33.410
If we do your work,
you would make us young again?

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.290
I told once but you didn't believe?

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.410
No, no. I mean,
our age will reduce by 20 years?

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:42.330
20 years.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:47.250
But I too have a thing to say.

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:49.810
What, Acharya?

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:55.410
You'll steal the gems and
hand over to me. What's the surety?

01:09:57.970 --> 01:09:59.450
Who else will we give it to?

01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:03.730
And we've told you we've no greed.
- Yes.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.810
What if I don't believe that?

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:10.370
Then what do you want to do?

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:18.410
I want... these three days
you'll be hypnotised by me. Okay?

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:21.450
Then only you'll work as I say.

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:24.210
And after three days?

01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:26.410
You'll get back to your previous self.

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:30.250
That power also I know.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:34.410
Then we've no problem.
What do you say, Bagha?

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:35.530
No, no.

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:41.570
Shankhapur, Kanchanpur, Bishalnagar.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.530
Will you remember?

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.210
Kanchanpur, Bishalpur..
- Bishalnagar.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.370
Yes, Bishalnagar.

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:50.010
And Shankhapur.
- Yes.

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:56.250
In these three days,
each day you'll get me one gem.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:11:02.330
From the three kings' heads.
For this, you've to sing songs.

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:05.210
There's nothing easier than that.

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:08.770
But under your charm,
will I be able to sing?

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:10.370
Can I play my drum?

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.850
If we can't sing and play music,
we can't steal gems.

01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:17.290
Yes.

01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:22.330
That'll be tested. But I believe.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:29.330
Your music capacity
will remain as it is.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:36.970
Good. Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:40.330
What ready, Acharya?
We've come all prepared. - Yes.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:44.970
Bagha, take your drum.
I'm coming in a minute.

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:49.530
Hail, the devil.
- Hail, the devil.

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:57.450
We're your servants.
- We're your servants.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:03.370
Whatever you command.
- Whatever you command.

01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:09.370
We'll obey that.
- We'll obey that.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:13.210
We'll not obey anyone else's command.

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:17.250
We'll not obey anyone else's command.

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:22.290
Baghanath, take your drum.

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:27.410
Gopinath, help.

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:40.490
Now, you come and stand
in front of this wall.

01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:58.370
Gopinath, sing.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.290
Sing, Gopinath!

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.370
Sing, Gopinath.

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:19.570
Baghanath, play your drum.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:24.090
Today...today... today...today..

01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:28.370
"From today, from today, from today."

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:31.090
"From today we've got ready."

01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:34.770
"As if we're no more Gopi-Bagha."

01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.730
"Are we human, or animals?"

01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:40.850
"We don't know the answer."

01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:42.930
"We don't know the answer."

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:47.130
"We're dangerous. We're dangerous."

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.810
"We're the master's blind servants."

01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:01.650
"There's cold blood in our veins."

01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:09.570
"Tough in misdeeds.
We're cunning. We're cunning."

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:13.650
"We're dangerous. We're dangerous."

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.370
"One day we were in darkness."

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:28.370
"Repeatedly defeating the evil."

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.010
"Now, we know our mistake."

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:36.090
"We've left the good.
We've left the good."

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:40.730
"We're dangerous. We're dangerous."

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.450
My test is a success.

01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:52.370
Nothing more to worry about.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:59.810
The world's best three
gems are now in my hand.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:07.250
Listen, your work starts tomorrow.
Today is an off.

01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:10.370
My servant will take you to your room.

01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:14.410
Under my charm,
your hunger and thirst will continue.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.450
Sleep is also essential at night.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:19.210
There's arrangement for everything.
No dearth.

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:28.770
Now, go. Tomorrow,
I'll help you get your disguise.

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:31.330
First day you'll go to Shankhapur.

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:36.290
In three after work is done,
you'll get free of hypnotise.

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:42.290
Young? Young? Young?

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:46.450
You'll be, you'll be...
You'll be young.

01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:49.570
Now, go.
Tomorrow, I'll talk to you again.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:56.330
Morning?
- Yes, yes. Morning. Now go to your room.

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:24.170
Disgusting.
- This work isn't easy, brother Bagha.

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:27.250
Last I got slapped by
my father in my childhood.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:30.690
We rule a kingdom,
and this behaviour with us?

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:33.410
I'll take revenge.
Or else I'll quit playing my drum.

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:37.410
But one thing I just do not understand.
- What?

01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:40.490
Why did he catch only
twelve year old Bikram-s?

01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:47.290
We'll know that slowly.
Have little patience.

01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:52.170
What are you saying?
- I'm saying the right thing.

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:54.450
Acharya has hypnotised
and imprisoned all 13.

01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:57.370
Now, they work as his servants.

01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:00.930
But the kings of Shundi
couldn't do anything?

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:05.250
They've wanted three days.
- But we can hardly wait.

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:07.410
Once that we've heard they are there.

01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:10.210
Acharya?

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:15.410
I misunderstood him so much?

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:25.210
We can't let this happen.
- No, Your Majesty.

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:28.250
You give soldiers.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:31.610
We 13 fathers will go to
the fort and rescue our sons.

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:33.730
And with that..

01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:38.810
And with that, bring Acharya to you?

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.610
Okay. I'm making
arrangements right now.

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:54.890
Army Commander!

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:49.290
The kings army is coming, master.

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:55.250
Let them come.

01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:58.490
Master?
- Let them come.

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:03.410
Okay, master.
- And, listen.

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:07.250
Bring the rest of
the boys to this room.

01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:30.210
You all stand in the line here.

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:37.370
Even you all go.

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:46.090
Dambaru!
Dundubi! Even you come and stand.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:13.410
Bikram! You can't recognise me, dear?
I'm your father.

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:14.570
Bikram!

01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:20.890
Let's go, let's elope. Bikram! Bikram!

01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:35.410
Bikram! Bikram dear.
What has happened to you?

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:40.170
Why did you?
Why did you become like this, Bikram?

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:43.570
They've just turned twelve.

01:21:44.690 --> 01:21:46.570
Another month they'll remain this way.

01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:50.650
Then I'll leave them.

01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.530
You don't have the right
to capture them like this.

01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:57.170
We'll arrest you and take
you to the king. He'll judge.

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:05.050
You'll arrest me?

01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:21.130
Do.
- Arrest him.

01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:07.250
You can't. You can't. You can't.

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:13.530
I learnt from my teacher,
the art to increase this weight.

01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:16.490
You're uselessly wasting your energy.

01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:11.930
"Warning! Warning! Warning!"

01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:16.370
"Stop all work,
stop walking, stop talking."

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:20.410
"Quietly, shut your mouth,
and all of you halt."

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:24.610
"All of you quietly,
shut your mouth, and halt."

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:30.370
"By that time,
let's get our job done."

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:34.690
"By that time,
let's get our job done."

01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:42.210
"We know this, we know this."

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:46.410
"This is called theft
in broad daylight."

01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:50.130
"This is called theft
in broad daylight."

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:55.090
"What's the reason of doing it,
that's not allowed to reveal."

01:24:55.170 --> 01:25:00.650
"We just obey our master.
We just obey our master."

01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:07.970
"For this job,
we've come to you, Your Majesty."

01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:21.490
"The diamond has come in our hands."

01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:27.610
"We're going. Coming back
to this court isn't possible."

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:36.250
"Isn't possible. Isn't possible.
Warning! Warning! Warning!"

01:26:14.130 --> 01:26:20.850
Stretch out your hand.
I said I would reward you.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:26.530
So, despite you not wanting it,
I'm giving.

01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:49.250
Do you know who I am?
- Cow.

01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:52.410
What? What did you say?

01:26:52.770 --> 01:26:58.810
Master. Master. Master.

01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:03.090
Master. Master.
- Stop now.

01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:07.410
It seems you've got
hypnotised quite strongly.

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:11.250
Your language is getting twisted.

01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:15.250
I'll tell you something.

01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:19.210
In normal condition, you'll be amazed.

01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:22.530
So, now, I'm telling you peacefully.

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:27.250
Do you know what
I was before becoming..

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:33.250
..the devil's disciple?
Dacoit. All those gems you saw.

01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:35.330
It's all the burgled wealth.

01:27:36.570 --> 01:27:41.610
I wasn't made immortal
because of my greed.

01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:48.570
He told the cause of my death
will be a twelve year old boy.

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:54.250
Whose name is Bikram.
Who stays in Anandapur.

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:59.370
All the twelve year
old boys named Bikram..

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:04.330
..in this town. I've captured
them in this fort and hypnotised them.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:10.330
Now, they are my servants.
These thirteen boys.

01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:16.530
In Anandapur, there's no other
twelve year old Bikram. Except them.

01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:21.570
It means the one who
would be my cause of death.

01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:27.250
Is now my obedient servant.
So now I'm immortal.

01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:31.490
For ages, I'll enjoy my wealth.

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:37.170
I'll be the owner of the
world's three most precious gems.

01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:46.810
As soon as I get the three gems..

01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:51.370
..I'll free you.

01:28:51.810 --> 01:28:56.490
Young? Young?
- Yes, yes. I remember.

01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:59.450
I'll make you young and then free you.

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:04.450
But before that,
I want the two more gems.

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:09.370
Kanchanpur, and Bishalnagar.

01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:13.330
One tomorrow,
and another the day after.

01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:32.450
You heard all that?
- Heard.

01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:35.490
And understood that Bikram story also.

01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:38.610
Oh, God. What a monster!

01:29:39.490 --> 01:29:43.290
Monster, that's why doesn't
get hypnotised by our song.

01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:47.490
Correct.
Our song works only on humans.

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:49.570
Why? Why only humans?

01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:52.530
Don't you remember the tiger of Hirok?
- Oh, yes, yes.

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:54.410
It works on all the
creatures of this world.

01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:59.450
Only no effect on the
creatures of heaven and hell.

01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:05.290
I was thinking. The twelve
year old Bikram who'll kill him.

01:30:05.770 --> 01:30:09.250
Isn't he one of those thirteen?
- I think so, Brother Bagha.

01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:14.370
Then it's a problem.
As long as that monster is alive.

01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:18.210
The real Bikram won't get free.
He'll be under his charm.

01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:22.650
We'll be free in two days.
After that we'll ask Pradeep Pandit.

01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:26.490
To search if there's any
other twelve year old Bikram.

01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:28.410
That we have to do.

01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:39.370
Your Majesty!
- What's the news? Where were you?

01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:41.170
In Anandagarh fort.

01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:42.370
Fort?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.490
Acharya has imprisoned 13 boys there.

01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:47.530
We know, Your Majesty.
Even we have work there.

01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:50.050
Work? What work?

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:52.610
That we can't tell you now,
Your Majesty.

01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:54.410
Day after tomorrow we'll
return and tell you everything.

01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:56.410
Then what will happen to those boys?

01:30:56.890 --> 01:30:58.570
You can depend on us, Your Majesty.

01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:01.410
We feel we can rescue them.

01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:03.410
You have patience. Only two days.

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:06.410
Will you again go back there?

01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:09.330
Yes, Your Majesty.
- We told you we've work.

01:31:09.690 --> 01:31:13.530
But if we don't return in two days,
you search the fort.

01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:19.330
What's the use of searching?

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:23.210
And what else will happen?

01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:29.410
The way my soldiers were defeated,
I'm feeling helpless.

01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:36.250
Acharya is such a dangerous man?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:38.450
But we are trying our best.

01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:41.490
But...

01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:46.170
..you won't be harmed any way, right?

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:48.530
His magical powers!

01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:51.610
Those powers even we have,
Your Majesty.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:54.210
A couple of them you've seen yourself.

01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:56.210
Yes, I have.

01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:58.250
So, now, do we leave?

01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:03.450
Go. But until you return.

01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:05.170
Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:08.570
Fort!

01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:52.490
"Warning! Warning!"

01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:55.370
"We came rushing. Rushing."

01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:58.050
"You see staring. Staring."

01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:01.010
"The way we do our job by singing."

01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:08.730
"The way we do our job,
you see today."

01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:11.850
"You see today."

01:33:16.770 --> 01:33:22.210
"We get good prize,
and eat good food."

01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:27.250
"We go from country
to country to do our job."

01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:35.570
"We've no shame.
No shame. You see today."

01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:46.330
"That diamond which
sparks on the head."

01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:50.970
"That diamond which
sparks on the head."

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:57.050
"We've come for that.
We've come for that."

01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:05.170
"We want that. We want that."

01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:14.090
"You see the way we steal that."

01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:33.690
"Our job is done. Job is done."

01:34:33.930 --> 01:34:38.610
"Now, let's return home."

01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:45.010
"Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye."

01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:08.490
Master?

01:35:14.610 --> 01:35:16.410
Open and take away their shoes.

01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:32.370
Betrayers. Yesterday, my guard went
to your room. But you weren't there.

01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:34.850
Where did you go? Answer.

01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:45.370
You didn't get hypnotised.
Just pretended. You've such courage.

01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:47.930
Where did you go? Say. Say.

01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:53.410
Forgive us, Acharya.
We had gone to the king. - Yes.

01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:55.890
To tell him not to worry.
- Yes.

01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:57.530
That we'll return in two days.

01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:01.290
You didn't say anything else?
- No, no, no.

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.170
Believe us,
we didn't say anything else.

01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:07.490
If you do,
then also no one can harm me.

01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:10.610
I would've killed you today itself.

01:36:12.010 --> 01:36:15.450
But I still have to get that one gem.
- Master?

01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:21.770
Keep it there.
These shoes will be with me here.

01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:25.610
Tomorrow, when you go to Bishalnagar,
you'll get it back.

01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:35.170
But one thing.
The gem should be given in my hand.

01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:40.410
Or else you won't be released.
My spies are in every country.

01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:44.370
You can't be free even
if you go back to Shundi.

01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:48.210
The power of Brahmananda
will hunt you down.

01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:49.410
Remember that.

01:36:52.650 --> 01:36:55.290
And if we give the gem in your hand?

01:36:55.850 --> 01:37:01.370
Then I'll fulfil what I
had promised you. Or else not.

01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:06.450
I mean, I mean you'll
reduce our age by twenty years?

01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:11.290
Did I promise anything else?
- No, no.

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:14.370
Chumbok!
- Yes, master?

01:37:14.730 --> 01:37:17.050
Take them to their
room and give them drinks.

01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:19.170
They'll rest now.

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:28.450
Anyway, one thing is for sure.
We'll give the gem to him.

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:32.450
And our age will reduce by 20 years.
- Yes, sure.

01:37:33.450 --> 01:37:35.290
But I'm thinking what
will happen to the boys?

01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:39.370
Unless Acharya dies,
they will remain in his custody.

01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:41.010
And won't leave this fort.

01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:45.650
One thing,
this Pishach Shiddha, that master.

01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:48.210
How could he make such a mistake?

01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:53.330
If Bikram will be hypnotised by him,
how can Bikram kill him?

01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:58.330
Correct. That Bikram
must be somewhere else.

01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:01.450
To find him is the main work.

01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:05.170
Pradeep Pandit.
- What?

01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.370
I'll give this responsibility to him.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:12.810
We'll tell him unless
real Bikram if found..

01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:14.490
..the thirteen boys
can't be rescued. -Yes.

01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:16.730
Tomorrow is holiday,
let him search for Bikram. - Yes.

01:38:17.130 --> 01:38:19.250
And let us got to Bishalnagar
and bring the gem.

01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:21.530
But when will you tell Pradeep Pandit?
And how will you?

01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:25.370
There's no shoe.
- We'll walk.

01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:28.250
We'll ask the villagers his house.

01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:31.170
How will you get out of here?
Who'll open the door?

01:38:31.690 --> 01:38:33.810
The door is locked from outside.

01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:38.330
Disgusting.
This time it's our bad luck.

01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:42.170
Can't understand what to do.
Such condition.

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:43.370
Well said, Brother.

01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:54.210
Hey! That stone isn't
a thing to play with.

01:38:57.930 --> 01:39:00.450
What's the use? Useless.

01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:04.650
There are so many stones
like this in our Shundi. - Yes.

01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:28.450
What? You want that?

01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:35.450
I want. I want. I want.

01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:47.330
If we give, will you let us go out?
- I will. And I'll elope too.

01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:49.290
I can't stand this torture anymore.

01:39:51.970 --> 01:39:53.330
What's your master doing now?

01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:56.250
He won't come to this side now.
You elope.

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:05.490
No, we won't elope.
- We'll return in sometime.

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:08.810
Listen. You do something.
Give us the keys of this room's lock.

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.450
We'll lock from outside,
he won't come to know.

01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:27.210
Give.

01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:30.370
Take.

01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:40.170
The door is open.
You go whenever you want. Okay?

01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:41.570
Whenever you want.

01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:49.410
So, Brother Bagha, let's go?

01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:53.570
We will. Let's have the drink.
Feeling thirsty.

01:41:00.570 --> 01:41:04.330
There's a market nearby.
There must be people there.

01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:09.210
I know. But I'm sleepy.

01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:13.330
What?

01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:17.170
Even you?

01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:21.490
I can't keep my eyes open.
- Right.

01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:24.210
No..

01:41:26.730 --> 01:41:30.210
Let's take a nap. Then..

01:41:34.170 --> 01:41:35.330
What's the matter?

01:41:36.730 --> 01:41:43.410
The drink.
There was something in the drink.

01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:16.450
"Gopi Bagha, Gopi Bagha, Gopi Bagha."

01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:19.010
Hello, Your Majesty.

01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:21.410
"Why do you go on the wrong way?"

01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:23.850
"Why do you go? Why do you go?"

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:28.610
"I tell no. Then even you go.
Then even, then even."

01:42:29.050 --> 01:42:34.450
"It upsets me. Upsets me. Upsets me."

01:42:36.090 --> 01:42:39.290
It was our fault, Your Majesty.
- Forgive us, Your Majesty.

01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:41.250
We had greed.

01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.050
He promised to reduce
our age by twenty years.

01:42:43.130 --> 01:42:45.090
"Why? Why? Why? Why?"

01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:51.570
"What's the problem if you are 40?
What problem?"

01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:56.850
"This way everyone turns forty,
sixty, and eighty."

01:42:56.930 --> 01:43:04.290
"And you will also.
There isn't any problem. No problem."

01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:08.530
"If the heart is young,
if knowledge is enhanced.."

01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:12.290
"..respect is more, that's good.
That's good."

01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:16.410
"That's all I want.
All I want. All I want."

01:43:17.010 --> 01:43:19.010
Then, now what do we do, Your Majesty?

01:43:19.170 --> 01:43:21.010
"Sing and apologise."

01:43:21.090 --> 01:43:24.570
"Apologise. Apologise. Apologise."

01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:31.370
"All your sins will wash away.
All scars erased. Erased."

01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:33.370
What will happen to that devil,
Your Majesty?

01:43:33.450 --> 01:43:37.330
"Tomorrow's his punishment."

01:43:37.410 --> 01:43:41.610
"Punishment. Punishment."

01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:47.250
"I'm going. I'm going."

01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:51.530
"I'm going. I'm going. I'm going."

01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:43.890
"See there, the day breaks."

01:44:46.850 --> 01:44:55.530
"See there, the day breaks."

01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:09.530
"Turning the east sky red,
the golden sun rises."

01:45:13.290 --> 01:45:24.210
"Turning the east sky red,
the golden sun rises."

01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:36.050
"In this light,
we beg for forgiveness."

01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:44.610
"In this light,
we beg for forgiveness."

01:45:47.490 --> 01:45:58.490
"Forgive us. Forgive us."

01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:08.810
"We'll never again commit such a sin."

01:46:09.810 --> 01:46:16.770
"We'll never again commit such a sin."

01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:23.050
"Shame. What a shame."

01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:39.050
"It's not dark anymore.
It's not dark anymore."

01:46:42.610 --> 01:46:52.490
"The darkness of our souls is erased.
We're good again."

01:46:53.610 --> 01:47:03.770
"The darkness of our souls is erased.
We're good again."

01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:09.170
"We're good. We're good."

01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:15.130
"So bright light."

01:47:22.570 --> 01:47:23.530
Brother Bagha!

01:47:26.410 --> 01:47:28.930
I saw ghost king in my dreams.

01:47:29.690 --> 01:47:36.290
Even I saw.
The same dream. My heart is heavy.

01:47:36.370 --> 01:47:39.330
Why now?
I've sung and begged forgiveness.

01:47:39.730 --> 01:47:43.410
You apologised on my behalf?
- Won't I? We're soul mates.

01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:50.490
Now, the heat is feeling
fresh and light. What's the worry?

01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:52.370
But the gems we've stolen?

01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:57.490
Brother Bagha,
Acharya till now hasn't awoken.

01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:02.370
Let's go and get those gems.
- Correct.

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:53.810
What's the matter?
You here? So, early in the morning?

01:48:54.010 --> 01:48:57.410
Searching for you, Pandit.
Because we've to know.

01:48:57.770 --> 01:49:00.610
Whether there's any
twelve year old Bikram here.

01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:02.210
But why?

01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:04.010
The devil teacher had said that.

01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:07.410
A twelve year old Bikram in Anandapur.

01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:09.490
Will be Acharya's cause of death.

01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:13.970
That's why he has captured all of them?
- Yes. - Exactly.

01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:17.330
But that Pishachshiddha's
prediction is proving wrong.

01:49:17.690 --> 01:49:20.410
Because if hypnotised,
then how will he kill him, you say?

01:49:20.890 --> 01:49:24.610
So, we were thinking
if there's any more Bikram.

01:49:26.850 --> 01:49:30.210
No. There isn't. I would've known.

01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:34.130
Then there's grave trouble, Pandit.

01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:43.170
That means you give up?
Giving us, giving us hope..

01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:44.410
Kanu!

01:49:46.130 --> 01:49:51.410
Kanu! Kanu! Kanu!

01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:57.010
Kanu! Kanu!

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:58.370
What happened, Naybeddo?

01:49:59.170 --> 01:50:02.370
I can't find Kanu.
- What?

01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:08.570
Yes. I sat to pray, and he has eloped.
- Eloped? Where?

01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:10.490
One thing, Naybeddo.

01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:14.330
They?
- They're kings of Shundi.

01:50:15.690 --> 01:50:17.330
Does Kanu have any good name?

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:23.570
What do I say? He had a name.

01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:27.330
I named him.

01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:36.290
But within a few days his father,
that's my..

01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:39.410
..my only son.

01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:42.610
Was thunder-struck and he died.

01:50:43.610 --> 01:50:46.730
Thence, we didn't use that name.

01:50:47.490 --> 01:50:49.210
Kanu himself doesn't know.

01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:52.330
What's that name?
- Bikram.

01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:54.170
Bikram! Bikram!

01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:57.970
According to Kanu's stars,
it was written that..

01:50:59.010 --> 01:51:02.530
..at twelve, slowly supernatural
powers will develop in him.

01:51:04.610 --> 01:51:08.770
Four days back, he's turned twelve.

01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:14.170
Yesterday, he was saying he'll
kill the demon of the fort today.

01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:17.370
That means he has gone there.

01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:19.290
Come, Gopinath.
- Let's go. - Come Pandit.

01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:29.450
Kanu! Kanu!

01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:35.250
Kanu!

01:51:59.730 --> 01:52:00.570
Kanu!

01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:05.170
Kanu!

01:52:21.210 --> 01:52:23.930
Master, we opened the
lock and found the room empty.

01:52:24.010 --> 01:52:25.410
They've eloped, master.

01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:26.610
Useless.

01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:30.410
They're somewhere in this town.

01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:34.250
Bring them from wherever you can. Go.
- Okay, master.

01:52:47.530 --> 01:52:48.450
Kanu!

01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:55.370
Where are you going alone?
- Fort.

01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:58.690
Grandpa is searching for you.
- I'll go back to grandpa.

01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:02.290
When? - First, let me go to the fort.
I've a work there.

01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:05.370
You're a small boy,
what work do you have, Kanu?

01:53:05.650 --> 01:53:08.490
Go back home. Good boy.
- What will you all do?

01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:11.250
My son is imprisoned
in the fort, Kanu.

01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:14.490
I've to bring him back.
- How will you bring back Bikram?

01:53:15.490 --> 01:53:20.170
I'm a young man, if needed,
I'll defeat Acharya. He's old.

01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:26.210
You won't be able to.
- Why can't I? I surely can.

01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:28.370
Except me, no one can.

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:32.330
What power do you have, Kanu?

01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:35.410
You come with me,
then you'll understand.

01:54:03.490 --> 01:54:06.610
No, no. No!

01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:11.250
What has happened?
What's happening? My gems..

01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:13.330
Where did my gems vanish?

01:54:16.290 --> 01:54:18.250
Listen, Brahmananda!

01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:20.370
Command, my Lord?

01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:24.210
Those gems are of no more use.
- Why? Why, my Lord?

01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:29.450
Your end has come.
You get ready for death.

01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:32.210
You've lot of sins.

01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:37.330
You hypnotised 13 boys,
and made them servants.

01:54:37.810 --> 01:54:42.210
You tempted two innocent
men with false promises.

01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:44.490
And made them steal for you.

01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:47.450
Master.
- You can't reduce anyone's age.

01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:50.290
That art I didn't teach you.

01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:53.290
You did it only for the greed of gems.

01:54:53.370 --> 01:54:55.210
No.
- Your greed is your sin.

01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:57.490
And this sin is your death.
- No.

01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:59.330
Get ready.

01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:04.410
But that boy? That twelve year old boy?
- He's coming.

01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:07.250
He possesses heavenly powers.

01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:11.610
You won't be able to
tolerate his innocent eyes.

01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:14.610
You can't. You can't. You can't.

01:55:15.170 --> 01:55:21.210
Master! Master! Master! Master!

01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:15.450
You've come?

01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:54.330
Who's he?

01:56:54.570 --> 01:57:00.410
Bikram. Bikram. Bikram.

01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:06.290
Bikram. Bikram. Bikram.

01:57:06.370 --> 01:57:12.210
Bikram. Bikram. Bikram.

01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:18.050
Bikram. Bikram. Bikram.

01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:21.370
Bikram. Bikram.
- Take him away.

01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:23.330
Bikram.
- Take him away.

01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:27.370
Bikram. Bikram.
- He's innocent. He's my death.

01:57:31.570 --> 01:57:32.650
You won't sing a song?

01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:36.610
"Oh, you devil."

01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:46.210

01:58:14.890 --> 01:58:20.730
"Your punishment will be severe."

01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:27.290
"You ruthless devil. Bikram."

01:58:27.650 --> 01:58:36.490
"Oh, you devil.
Now, you've no escape."

01:58:39.650 --> 01:58:46.210
"Now, you've no escape."

01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:55.410
Yahoo!

Our work's over."
