00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.375
All are on their way to decay

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.875
On horses,
on elephants or on foot

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.958
Or on a chariot
decked with flowers

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:25.916
All are on their way to decay

00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:35.958
So,whatever is old and dilapidated,sell
it off, sell it off, sell it off.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.708
Sell it off,
sell it off, sell it off.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.166
This evening lamp… sell it off.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.166
The evening lamp which
used to light up this mansion…

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:58.250
The zamindar saw his wife for
the first time in the light of this lamp.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.000
Who will take this lamp home ?

00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.000
Who wants to
name a price for it?

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.791
Please speak up.

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:07.916
11 !

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:09.958
Nitai is a smart fellow.

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:13.916
He has quoted Rs.
11,000 for this lamp.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.416
Not Rs. 11,000.

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.125
I said Rs. 11.

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:22.083
The zamindar’s
lamp only for Rs. 11?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.041
Is there anyone else who
wants to quote a price for this?

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.958
Going for 11,
once… Going for 11, twice…

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.458
Going for 11, thrice!

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.291
-Sir?

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.333
-Sell it off… Sell it off.

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.000
Sell it off, sell it off.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:38.958
Netai, come and take it.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.541
This evening lamp
is sold for only Rs. 11.

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:44.666
Give me the money.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:52.291
Congratulations, Netai,
for buying this beautiful lamp for Rs. 11!

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:58.625
The one whose ancestors would wash
their mouths with expensive alcohol…

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:04.500
He is now drinking
hooch and saying,

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.708
“Sell it off”.

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:12.625
The condition of the last heir of this
zamindar family is similar to this statue here.

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:16.166
Time is a cruel taskmaster.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.875
-Shut up, you idiot!

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.166
Hey, bring the Rs. 11 here.

00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:26.833
Here, take this money.

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:32.166
Bring him some snacks
to go with the hooch.

00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:40.958
The next item is the sword.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:42.875
The sword!

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:44.833
The sword!

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:05.125
This is the sword that the zamindars
used to subdue lions, british and pirates…

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:10.416
Who is the brave soul here who
can carry the weight of this sword?

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.041
-Is there no one ?
-There is no one…

00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:17.375
Badna,
aren’t you part of the theatre group?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.541
Then,
I’m sure you’ll need it for your play.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:22.791
You take it.

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:25.041
This is too heavy, sir.

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:26.833
The play will be over
by the time I can lift it.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.375
The play won’t be over.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:33.833
It’ll be respected more
because of this sword.

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:37.375
Give me Rs. 100 for it.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.208
The play will be over
by the time I can lift it.

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.333
No, no, I don’t want it…

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:47.875
Rs. 1000!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Rs. 1000!

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:01.833
Haven’t had any whiskey
in such a long time…

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:13.500
Hello.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Somnath tell me.

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:21.583
Yeah, I’m good.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.333
How are you?

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.750
How is Kusum?

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:32.375
Take care of her.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Go ahead…

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:39.166
What?

00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:41.250
Hello,
Murshidabad electricity Board.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.875
Due to technical faults,there will be
no power supply for the next three day.

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:44.916
We are sorry…

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:48.208
Oh, it’s you…

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.791
You didn’t even
come for aunt’s funeral.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:52.583
You’re too busy…

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:54.000
Don’t tell me.

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:57.500
I prayed to Goddess Kali
and now they are gone.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.333
There’s major cable
fault underground.

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:03.958
It’ll take at least
three days to fix it.

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:07.208
There’ll be a power
cut all over Balrampur.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.625
You want to come now ?

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:11.750
Okay, come.

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:18.375
What is it ?

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:22.250
What is the matter?

00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.666
Praises to Manasa

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:32.000
We offer our prayers to Manasa

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:36.333
Praises to Manasa

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.416
We offer our prayers to Manasa

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.583
Praises to Manasa

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:58.041
We offer our
prayers to Lord Shiva

00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:02.791
Praises to Manasa

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:07.750
We offer our prayers to Manasa

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.916
Praises to Manasa

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:24.333
We offer our prayers
to the Mother Goddess

00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:28.041
Praises to Manasa

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:44.541
Hello,
sir. My name is Amirchand Mittal.

00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:50.750
We offer our prayers
to the Goddess Kali

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:55.500
Praises to Manasa

00:06:56.041 --> 00:07:04.333
We offer our prayers to Manasa

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.500
I can’t do it.

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:26.083
My last offer is 10 lakhs.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.208
Take another week’s time.

00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:33.958
Think about it.

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:54.583
We offer our prayers to Manasa

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:59.875
Praises to Manasa

00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:07.791
We offer our prayers to Manasa

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:17.250
We offer our
prayers to Lord Shiva

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:19.333
Hey, let’s go.

00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:24.458
Turn the car around.

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.541
Bloody Manasa!

00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:22.041
Sir, please trust me.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:26.750
No matter how influential Amirchand
Mittal is , I’ll catch him for sure.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:28.291
And with all the evidence!

00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:33.375
I have information that he has come
here in search of a historical treasure.

00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.416
He’ll try to smuggle
it out of the country.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.583
Sir, but…

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:48.750
Sir please try to understand.

00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.416
As an officer how
can I support this?

00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:52.875
We have a nominal morality…

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.666
Sir,
I can understand the position you’re in.

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:57.375
But please think about it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.166
How can we let go of a
smuggler like Amirchand Mittal?

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:23.208
Hello.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.000
Bloody CID!

00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:06.708
Stop right there!

00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:15.666
“Don’t go away, my love…

00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:18.125
“I’m going the same way too…”

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:19.625
Don’t shoot!

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.125
The city streets hide
secrets in it’s heart

00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:04.083
Impatient time silently
looking for the answers

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:20.416
Hiding quietly in the crowds
is the treasure of royals

00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:30.583
The weary traveller
comes home to his roots

00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:38.250
This is how history is painted

00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:50.000
Completely destroyed

00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:27.500
The chandelier is rusted,
broken walls guard the memories

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:34.416
The birds are trapped
in black and white

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:41.958
Forgotten roads
and forgotten titles

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:49.291
The magic of the 20th
century has worn out

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:58.875
All the history is erased

00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:07.166
All is destroyed

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:35.916
The dirt road parts
the green grass

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:43.291
The radio sings no more

00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:46.625
In search of an
unfinished puzzle

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.833
In search of an
exciting adventure

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:57.708
In search of justice

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:10.791
History is destroyed

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:18.708
THE MAZE OF ALINAGAR

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.625
The river flows

00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:27.208
Through Chitpur

00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:30.291
She flows through Kolkata

00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:33.041
The tide turns at
the end of the day

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:36.000
The businessman’s
son avoids Balurghat

00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:39.000
The boat finally
reaches Kalighat

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.458
In the words of the
famous poet Mukunda Ram

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.291
this is the course of
the Baghirathi river.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:50.625
The three villages, Sutanuti,
Gobindopur and Kolkata came together…

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.541
…to form Kolkata as we know
it. And we need to know it better.

00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:54.666
Sure.

00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:56.375
After Aurangazeb’s death,

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.041
Kolkata’s boundary
extended till…

00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:02.791
Till Bhagirathi in the West.

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.125
Till Sutanuti in the North.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.500
On the East,
there were wetlands and the canal.

00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:14.041
And Gobindopur in the South.

00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:19.333
The East India Company
made this their business colony.

00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:22.916
Where did Sutanuti
get it’s name from?

00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:27.916
Suta means thread in
Bengali… From there.

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:32.333
This is where the
weavers used to live.

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:37.333
After the Saraswati river dried up,
the weavers shifted here from Saptagram.

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:43.416
This used to be Gobindopur.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.041
Can you imagine, Dristi,
there used to be a dense forest here?

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:49.541
And just a few cottages.

00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.708
The air and water
weren’t very good.

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:52.750
There would be
epidemics all the time.

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:57.250
So, that’s why it’s called
the “dying Gobindopur”.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.666
Correct! This entire Fort William
area used to be Gobindopur village.

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:06.166
When Siraj-ud-Daulah
attacked Kolkata in 1756…

00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:09.166
He destroyed the
old fort of the British.

00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:14.000
Poor Brits! They didn’t
have good quality cement.

00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:17.041
The fort would have
been still here today.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:20.208
If you’re not serious about
this,I won’t talk anymore.

00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:24.250
I just wanted a
commercial break…

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.416
Please, take your break…

00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:27.208
Hey, why are you getting angry?

00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:30.458
Just bunk it…

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:32.833
Okay, please finish your story.

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:33.750
Okay.

00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:40.125
After Siraj’s death,
Lord Clive built the second British Fort.

00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:43.708
That forced the residents
to move to Sutanuti.

00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:45.208
-This was around…

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:48.333
-Please stop… Let it go please…

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.041
Please…

00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:52.375
You have no patience…

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:55.916
What’s your problem?

00:18:56.791 --> 00:19:05.458
This chandelier that
shines as bright as the day

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:17.750
The dancer… Many famous dancers
have performed under these chandeliers…

00:19:20.416 --> 00:19:24.250
This chandelier
ruined the ancestors…

00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:28.083
Gopal,were the masters of
this house very decadent?

00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.708
Decadence is an understatement.

00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:36.041
They would spend lakhs of
rupees on the weddings of their pets.

00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:42.708
And every evening
they would dress up…

00:19:42.708 --> 00:19:46.416
Take their cars out and
go to…You know where…

00:19:46.708 --> 00:19:47.791
-Sakshi Gopal?

00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:50.916
-Why have you stopped cleaning?

00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:55.041
Hey, Bristi!

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.541
Are we that distantly
related to you?

00:19:58.541 --> 00:20:02.375
You are my dad’s
cousin’s cousin’s…

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.958
Just stop it. You can’t even
remember how we’re related?

00:20:06.416 --> 00:20:17.500
I’m your own father’s own cousin’s own
cousin’s brother-in-law’s mother-in-law…

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.000
Is our relationship
that distant?

00:20:20.125 --> 00:20:22.416
No, no… Not distant at all.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.916
You concentrate on your work…

00:20:24.083 --> 00:20:26.291
But just look at Chandu.

00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:29.875
You know he suffers from
indigestion. The poor fellow…

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:32.416
They have arrested him again,
right?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.250
Please see if your
father can bail him out.

00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:41.750
It doesn’t work like that.

00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:44.833
You know my dad gets mad
about these things, Jaba Aunty.

00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:48.083
It harms the prestige of the family.
Please keep a check on Chandu.

00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:49.541
Disgusting!

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:56.416
Oh no! They’ll beat
my son black and blue!

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:58.500
What have you done, Missus?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.416
This is the great
mystery of time.

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:09.125
150 years back, the men of this family would
get drunk and roll around in the ditches…

00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:10.458
150 years back, the men of this family would
get drunk and roll around in the ditches…

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.083
And these people
talk about prestige.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:18.583
-My son is rotting in
prison and he is just…

00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:28.166
Dad?

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:32.416
When did you get back?

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:33.875
When did you get back?

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:34.583
Just now.

00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:41.583
-Did you have your medicines?

00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:42.250
-Yes.

00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:43.458
Are you telling the truth?

00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:50.666
Dad, can I ask you something?

00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:55.791
The scholarship program i6n
grandfather’s name in our university…

00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:58.041
Who has been
nominated this year?

00:21:58.708 --> 00:21:59.750
Who do I have to nominate?

00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:04.208
I’m not suggesting anything.
Please see for yourself.

00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:09.125
See if he is a
deserving candidate.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:13.166
So, this is Soham?

00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:17.166
Dad

00:22:18.291 --> 00:22:20.166
He has come this far on his own.

00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:24.916
He wants to do a research
on Bengali Literature.

00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.625
And that’s why he
needs the scholarship.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.291
He has no one
else in this world.

00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:33.083
He gives tuitions
to support himself.

00:22:34.041 --> 00:22:35.916
He has no idea about all this.

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:37.958
I’m telling you on my own.

00:22:39.208 --> 00:22:40.958
Can’t we give him
the scholarship?

00:22:42.083 --> 00:22:42.666
Please… b

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:46.541
Why don’t you invite him home ?

00:22:47.791 --> 00:22:48.750
Really?

00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:50.958
Okay.

00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:54.125
Thank you, Dad.

00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:55.000
-It’s okay…

00:22:57.833 --> 00:22:58.541
No, no… Not distant at all.

00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:02.083
Just wanted to let you
know one thing about Soham.

00:23:09.916 --> 00:23:12.208
Soham, time’s up.

00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:22.875
Sir,
in your book,”Bengal’s Mirror”…

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.458
You’ve shared a lot of semsitive information about the old Bengali families…
You’ve published it.

00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:31.125
- Did you have
any qualms about it?

00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:31.791
- Not at all.

00:23:33.833 --> 00:23:36.916
Because one group of Bengalis…

00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:40.458
After the Battle of Plassey,

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:50.333
People who worked for the British or the
Nawabs as accountants ,secretaries or agents…

00:23:51.208 --> 00:23:52.416
They were corrupt.

00:23:53.208 --> 00:24:00.125
And they literally sold the
country off to the British.

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:06.125
I thought that Bengalis
should know this history.

00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:08.000
But this is confidential
information.

00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:11.208
Didn’t you face any
objections while publishing?

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:13.958
Yes but I didn’t really
care about it much and…

00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:21.833
I just concentrated on my work.
And that’s why it’s still a bestseller.

00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.916
Of course.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.083
Should we begin again, sir?

00:24:57.833 --> 00:24:58.708
-Two lakhs.

00:24:58.958 --> 00:24:59.541
-Sorry,sir?

00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:00.333
Pay me two lakhs.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.791
Doesn’t my time have any value?

00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.708
I have researched
a lot for my book…

00:25:12.708 --> 00:25:15.500
You want me share such
important information just like that?

00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:18.375
Do you think my time is free?

00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:23.708
Sir, I’ll try.

00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:39.250
What’s your problem?

00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:43.000
Where will a struggling documentary
filmmaker get that kind of money?

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:48.666
It’s not a matter of death,
Bristi. It’s about need.

00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:53.000
I might be in need.

00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:56.750
How can you know what
another person might need?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.708
Someone might need 10 or 20 thousand.
Others might need two or three lakhs.

00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:01.583
But there’s always a need.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.625
You got another one?

00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:08.333
Do you have any idea
who is sending these to you?

00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:17.083
Dad, I think this is a prank.

00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:18.958
Don’t worry about these.

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:23.083
And these don’t make
any sense anyway.

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:26.416
I’m sure these mean something…

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:34.000
All those who conspired against
Siraj in the battle of Plassey…

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.708
These letters talk
about their fate.

00:26:38.791 --> 00:26:41.083
All the conspirators died under
extraordinary circumstances.

00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:44.416
What does the first one say?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.750
-Lightning struck Miran?

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.791
-Miran died when
lightning struck him.

00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:48.541
Miran is Mir Jafar’s oldest son.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.083
People say lightning killed him.

00:26:51.375 --> 00:26:54.250
Mohammed Ali Beg stabbed
Siraj under Miran’s orders.

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.375
What does the second one say?

00:26:57.208 --> 00:26:58.791
-Ghasiti Begum drowned in water.

00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:03.291
-Drowned in water… Ghasiti
Begum was another conspirator.

00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.958
Miran had Ghasiti Begum drowned.

00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:09.500
One conspirator
killing another one.

00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:10.750
Strange fallacy!

00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:12.625
-And third one ?

00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:13.708
-The third one says…

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.375
Lord Clive committed suicide by
cutting his own throat with a razor.

00:27:16.625 --> 00:27:19.916
Lord Clive was the British
Commander in the Battle of Plassey.

00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:25.291
He committed suicide once
he went back to England.

00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:28.666
Strange fallacy indeed!

00:27:29.541 --> 00:27:31.833
It’s connected and it
definitely means something.

00:27:32.458 --> 00:27:35.541
But why is someone sending
your father these letters?

00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:38.583
That’s what I don’t get.

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:46.291
There were a lot of objections when
he published his book “Bengal’s Mirror”.

00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:48.750
In fact,
he received some threats too.

00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:52.125
Dad published the book anyway.

00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:55.875
Don’t know if it’s one of them.

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:02.333
Anyway,don’t mention
any of this to him.

00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:05.458
You shouldn’t have
recommended me to your father.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.333
I did the right thing.

00:28:08.333 --> 00:28:09.208
You shouldn’t have..

00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:09.875
Why not ?

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.083
I don’t like taking
advantage of the situation.

00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:14.666
Does everything
have to be your way ?

00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:43.500
-Drink your tea
before it goes cold.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:43.875
-Oh yes…

00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:48.208
How many ponytails did
“Hutum Pyancha” have ?

00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:50.833
Do owls have ponytails?

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:55.916
51.

00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:01.541
Actually,Hutum Pyancha is
Kliprasad Singha’s pseudonym.

00:29:02.291 --> 00:29:03.500
-Yeah,
he translated the Mahabharata.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.083
Yes

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.750
If he saw any Brahmin
behaving unlike one…

00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:18.083
…like cheating students or
disrespecting women or lying…

00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:23.333
…he would chop their
ponytails off and take it home.

00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:29.625
He would label each ponytail
with the name and the crime.

00:29:30.708 --> 00:29:34.000
So,
he had collected 51 ponytails like this .

00:29:37.583 --> 00:29:41.791
-Brilliant! Mindblowing
! Bravo! Bravo!

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:42.583
-Thank you!

00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:44.583
Bravo!

00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:45.708
It’s okay.

00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:51.208
The scholarship is yours!

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.291
Do you have a place
to stay? You’ll stay here.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.166
I live in University hostel…

00:29:58.375 --> 00:30:00.416
No way… You’ll live here.

00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:02.458
It’s not a problem, sir…

00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:04.625
He is going against my wish…

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:07.041
Not a lot of people can do that.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.916
You’ll move in to this house.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:10.875
A lot of worthless
people live in this house.

00:30:11.875 --> 00:30:13.333
You’ll bring honour
to our family.

00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:14.666
Am I right?

00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:16.500
-Gopal?

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.916
-Yes…

00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:20.625
Soham will stay
in the room upstairs

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.375
Okay.

00:30:23.833 --> 00:30:24.625
Brilliant!

00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:33.041
Let’s go.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.791
-You look very happy.

00:30:37.208 --> 00:30:38.291
-Shut up, Sakhhi Gopal.

00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:45.625
Great… Another cow is
added in Hari Ghosh’s shed.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.416
What are you talking about ?

00:30:47.875 --> 00:30:49.333
No,
he didn’t say anything wrong.

00:30:50.375 --> 00:30:53.333
Hari Ghosh was one of the
oldest residents of Kolkata.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.541
The fire in his kitchen
never went out.

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:08.125
No matter when or who might be,
there was always food in his house.

00:31:08.708 --> 00:31:10.583
I guess it’s the
same in this house.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.291
Wow! This one is
really smarter it seems.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.291
He is my uncle.

00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:25.500
My name is Sakhhi
meaning witness.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.708
I witness everything.

00:31:26.708 --> 00:31:27.291
The one and only witness.

00:31:28.083 --> 00:31:30.000
My parents lovingly
named me Gopal.

00:31:30.458 --> 00:31:33.541
And we lovingly call
him Sakhhi Gopal.

00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.291
We’re very closely related.

00:31:37.958 --> 00:31:41.916
Her father’s cousin’s cousin’s…

00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:47.250
Something like that

00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:49.708
-Hey Korola!

00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:51.208
-He’s really funny.

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:51.583
-Coming… Okay…

00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:52.833
-Clean this room.

00:31:53.666 --> 00:31:55.791
-Soham is moving in with us.

00:31:55.916 --> 00:31:56.625
-Okay.

00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:02.250
Come here…

00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:08.666
Have you checked
his family history?

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:09.500
-Why?

00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:16.166
If he is not from an aristocratic
family,”butterflies” won’t fly…

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.291
We’ll fly our own “butterflies”.

00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:21.791
Please,get the room
ready for him quickly.

00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:23.916
-Listen, Brishti…

00:32:24.416 --> 00:32:25.333
-Let me give you
a tour of the house.

00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:36.291
You couldn’t
recognize your lover

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.583
Unknowingly you
jumped into the river

00:32:42.833 --> 00:32:44.041
I told you about my uncle…

00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:47.583
You’ll now stay here…

00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:51.333
You’ll hear his
violin very morning.

00:32:55.291 --> 00:32:56.291
-Hi.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.583
-Hi.

00:32:58.166 --> 00:32:59.708
Jahnabi Sen. Filmmaker.

00:32:59.958 --> 00:33:03.041
She wants to make a documentary film
on Dad’s “Bengal’s Mirror” and our family.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.875
And this is Soham, my friend.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.500
He is doing research
on Bengal’s history.

00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:07.875
-Hi…

00:33:07.875 --> 00:33:08.875
-And he is going
to live here too.

00:33:09.708 --> 00:33:16.500
I was planning to incorporate elements of
Kolkata and Bengal’s history in the film.

00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:17.708
Will you help me?

00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:21.458
Of course,
I’ll share whatever I know.

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:31.500
Come with me… Come!

00:33:32.166 --> 00:33:32.833
-Come…

00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:35.833
-My house…

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.208
-Mom…

00:33:39.208 --> 00:33:41.583
-My darling baby…

00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:43.416
Please control him.

00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:47.208
He gets away with it everytime
because of Mr. Asutosh.

00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:53.833
If you create a drunken mess another time,
I’ll beat you so bad…

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.500
Shut up and give me your baton.

00:33:56.625 --> 00:33:57.291
Shut up and give me your
baton. I’ll shoot you down…

00:33:57.541 --> 00:33:59.000
-But it’s broken.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.166
-Broken… Get out of here…

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:04.708
Darling,did they hurt you?

00:34:04.833 --> 00:34:07.416
Darling,did they hurt you?

00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:09.625
What are you saying, Mom?

00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:14.666
I’m from the Singho
dynasty. No one can touch me.

00:34:15.916 --> 00:34:17.125
Father!

00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:23.416
I have a “little” demand.

00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:25.708
What demand?

00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:27.791
The inspector has an iphone.

00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:32.208
Why don’t I have an iphone?

00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:37.125
Chandu, my son,
you don’t have an iphone?

00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:39.375
You think you deserve an iphone?

00:34:39.625 --> 00:34:42.541
Why? You don’t think so ?

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.541
How are you so dumb?

00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:49.750
-I don’t know…
-Get out of here,you idiot…

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.875
-No one understands you, my love…
-Disgrace!

00:34:56.541 --> 00:34:58.083
Skull with a fancy beard!

00:34:58.541 --> 00:34:59.458
Complete disgrace!

00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:07.791
Let’s start from tomorrow again?

00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:10.541
But sir I haven’t…

00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:12.583
Don’t worry about all that.

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:15.000
You continue with your work.

00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:18.541
I should be the one
saying sorry to you.

00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:20.458
Don’t know what
happened to me that day.

00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:22.208
I shouldn’t have
said those things.

00:35:22.416 --> 00:35:24.958
Please forget about it and
concentrate on the work.

00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:26.916
If you want you can
stay here and work.

00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:28.208
Thank you,
sir. Thank you so much.

00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:29.125
-Welcome.

00:35:29.125 --> 00:35:29.583
-Bye.

00:35:29.708 --> 00:35:30.708
-Bye.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.291
Please come in.

00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.625
I wanted to..

00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:42.333
I wanted to tell you something.

00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:49.541
It would have been Impossible for me to
write this book if a friend didn’t help me.

00:35:51.791 --> 00:35:53.875
My childhood friend,you know…

00:35:53.875 --> 00:35:55.416
He used to live in this house.

00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:57.208
-He was my…

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.041
-Thank you…

00:35:58.125 --> 00:36:03.916
He was doing his research at the Calcutta
University with the scholarship my father set up.

00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:06.541
And his field was
History of Bengal.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.208
Gem of a boy.

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:09.250
DEDICATION SOMNATH DAS

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.458
Really enthusiastic…

00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:13.541
Got me all the information…

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.875
-If it wasn’t for him…

00:36:15.041 --> 00:36:17.125
Can we get in touch with him?

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.708
Since I’m also
working on History…

00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:20.833
He’s no more.

00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:23.583
He died in a road accident.

00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:26.083
Around 26-27 years ago…

00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:29.625
Anyway,what I really
wanted to say was…

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.791
Right before his death,

00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:35.375
He had sent me a letter.

00:36:35.958 --> 00:36:39.125
He had written that
he had a gift for me.

00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:45.583
I was very excited about it.

00:36:46.041 --> 00:36:46.833
Just a second

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.916
I can only get the gift if I…

00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:57.958
If I could solve a riddle.

00:36:58.208 --> 00:37:01.125
It’s good one…
He wrote it himself.

00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:07.625
And if I solve it,I’ll
find something that…

00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:10.583
…something that has
a lot of historical value.

00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:11.291
-Okay…

00:37:11.416 --> 00:37:13.166
I still haven’t
been able to solve…

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.208
The lane where the
wife wears her clothes

00:37:21.583 --> 00:37:24.208
How many does Hutum Pyancha’s
collection of ponytails expose?

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:29.208
If you look carefully,
you’ll arrive

00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:34.041
Hasting’s revenge on 5-8-75

00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:42.500
Since you know how many
ponytails “Hutum Pyancha” had…

00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:45.041
That’s why I thought
I’ll show it to you.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:45.750
You never know…

00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:49.791
You might solve this…

00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:52.750
The very first line here…

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.083
You’ll hear his
violin very morning.

00:37:56.458 --> 00:37:59.500
Is it referring to you wife?

00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:00.708
I had thought so too…

00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:04.833
But her mom passed
away 17-18 years ago…

00:38:05.625 --> 00:38:10.375
I’ve asked around in all the places your
mom used to buy her sarees, jewelry etc…

00:38:11.458 --> 00:38:13.000
They couldn’t tell me much.

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:15.333
Interesting…

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.541
Very interesting…

00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:23.958
My stomach hurts!

00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:29.541
-Mom, give me my medicine!

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.625
- Bringing it, my son…

00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:35.041
What kind of a father are you ?

00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:36.166
Look at your son.

00:38:36.458 --> 00:38:38.958
His pain is killing him.

00:38:40.041 --> 00:38:41.125
Please wake up.

00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:48.458
What happened?

00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:51.708
Were you dreaming
of some actress?

00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:52.625
-What is it ?

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:57.708
-Our son is in a lot of pain…

00:38:58.333 --> 00:38:59.791
Oh okay… okay…

00:39:00.083 --> 00:39:01.791
Why are you going off to sleep?

00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:04.250
He needs his medicine.

00:39:04.416 --> 00:39:05.125
Don’t worry about it.

00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:07.708
His liver is already
gone because of alcohol.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.708
That’s what is hurting.

00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:10.708
What are you saying?

00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:13.583
It’s not alcohol.

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:15.708
It’s called whiskey.

00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:19.125
Please get a bottle of
whisky from Asu’s room.

00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:20.708
He might get some relief.

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.666
I’m in pain, Father!

00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:25.708
Do you want to kill him?

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:29.208
Just because you
live in this house,

00:39:29.875 --> 00:39:31.541
You’ve adopted
their lifestyle too.

00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:33.083
You have indigestion if
you don’t drink whisky.

00:39:33.583 --> 00:39:34.416
My bad luck!

00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:40.625
What a disgrace! We can’t even
get some whiskey for our son.

00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:42.333
-What kind of
whiskey do you want?

00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:45.791
-Scotch! Sctoch? Debjani’s son?

00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:49.000
It’s Jack’s son…

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.625
Something to do with a jack…

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.083
It’s Jack Daniel’s, Mom.

00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:55.041
-Jack Daniel’s?

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.958
-Jack Daniel’s!

00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:57.500
Do you know how much it costs?

00:39:59.458 --> 00:40:03.250
Even if we sell our son,
it won’t be enough.

00:40:03.541 --> 00:40:05.333
We belong to the Singho family,
Father.

00:40:05.625 --> 00:40:07.083
Don’t look at the price.

00:40:07.291 --> 00:40:09.166
We just want some relief,Father.

00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:10.166
Please, bring it…

00:40:11.083 --> 00:40:12.083
I really can’t.

00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:14.625
You get it for your son.

00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:15.958
I can’t.

00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:16.750
-I’ll get it.

00:40:17.125 --> 00:40:17.500
-Please do.

00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:20.541
Mom, get some ice and soda too.

00:40:24.416 --> 00:40:26.541
If you step out of the room,

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.458
I’ll kill this idiot!

00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:55.291
Hi.

00:40:56.416 --> 00:40:57.416
Oh ,hello!

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.083
-Busy?

00:40:58.625 --> 00:40:59.416
-No,no…

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.500
Can I ask you something?

00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:02.458
Yes, of course.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:10.250
Why are you so curious about
the History of Bengal and Kolkata?

00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:14.958
How do I put it?

00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:18.541
I always felt that this
city is very mysterious.

00:41:20.416 --> 00:41:25.375
Just imagine the
histories it has witnessed.

00:41:26.958 --> 00:41:31.000
Each little line
has a story to tell.

00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:36.291
That’s what draws me…

00:41:37.833 --> 00:41:38.166
-Hello.

00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:38.916
-Hi.

00:41:39.166 --> 00:41:39.666
-Hi.

00:41:40.125 --> 00:41:40.875
-What are you talking about?

00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:43.583
- My interest in History.

00:41:44.583 --> 00:41:47.125
Anyway, I’ll see you later.

00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:47.708
-Okay.

00:41:47.708 --> 00:41:48.166
-Yes.

00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:51.958
Sit , sit, sit…..

00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:55.666
I think I’ve figured out
what “5-8-75” means.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.958
“5-8-75, Hasting’s revenge”?

00:42:00.625 --> 00:42:02.250
I’ve made a huge
mistake by calling you here.

00:42:02.375 --> 00:42:02.708
-Why ?

00:42:02.916 --> 00:42:03.750
Now, you’re going to bore me

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.791
With details about Hastings.

00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:05.500
Just hear me out.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:05.875
Don’t worry about it.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.791
It’s very interesting.

00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:07.625
Let me tell you the story.

00:42:08.458 --> 00:42:11.250
After Mirjafar died,
Diwan Nandakumar…

00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:15.375
…reported against Warren Hastings
corruption to the East India Company.

00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:19.375
And as payback,
Hastings filed a case against Nandakumar…

00:42:20.125 --> 00:42:22.541
…claiming he forged documents.

00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:25.166
Nandakumar has
sentenced to be hanged.

00:42:25.666 --> 00:42:28.250
The date of the
hanging was ‘5-8-1775”.

00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:31.958
This riddle talks
about Nandakumar.

00:42:32.958 --> 00:42:35.541
What does that have
to do with my mom ?

00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:37.166
They are related in some way.

00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:40.041
We need to find out how.

00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:44.000
Hey, I think my brother’s here.

00:42:57.666 --> 00:42:58.166
-Brother…

00:42:58.458 --> 00:43:00.041
-Tell me. -Why are you so late ?

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:01.458
-Just… Your flight was delayed?

00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:02.500
-By two hours.

00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:04.250
This came for you.

00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:05.583
What’s this ?

00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:09.625
I didn’t open it.

00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:10.500
It was Dad.

00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:15.291
I have no privacy in this house.

00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:20.250
The bank’s recovery agents
have already come home twice.

00:43:20.458 --> 00:43:21.791
Dad is trying hard
to keep them at bay.

00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:23.041
Thank him for his favour.

00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:26.375
Can i tell you something?

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:28.708
Please stop spending
money excessively.

00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:31.416
What are you talking about?

00:43:32.166 --> 00:43:33.666
You buy a phone every month…

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:36.791
You buy a new car often…

00:43:36.875 --> 00:43:38.708
You’re throwing
extravagant parties…

00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:41.083
Travelling abroad… Don’t you
think you’re spending too much?

00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:43.625
You might not understand it.

00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:46.291
But these are
necessities for me.

00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:54.583
That’s enough for me.

00:43:57.625 --> 00:43:59.125
So, researching History, I see…

00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:02.833
That’s great but
what’s the point?

00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:06.708
You’ll ultimately
become a professor.

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:09.291
So,
what’s wrong with being a professor?

00:44:13.583 --> 00:44:17.000
Where do you live ?
What does your father do ?

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.125
Soham has grown
up in an orphanage.

00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:25.000
He doesn’t know
who his parents are.

00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:28.125
Dad and I don’t
have a problem with it.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.291
Right, Dad?

00:44:36.333 --> 00:44:37.833
Can you pass me the gravy?

00:44:44.666 --> 00:44:46.166
Sir.

00:45:41.833 --> 00:45:42.916
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:45:42.916 --> 00:45:43.375
-What happened?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.708
Why are you
littering this place?

00:45:46.916 --> 00:45:48.416
Get out of here.

00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.083
-Hello, Nitai.

00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:52.333
-Hello, sir.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.708
Are you here for the clay?

00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:57.166
Isn’t this clay full of goodness,
Nitai?

00:45:58.416 --> 00:46:01.375
And Mother will come alive.

00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:06.208
She’ll get dressed
at Jorashankho.

00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.500
She’ll have a
feast in Kumurtuli…

00:46:10.125 --> 00:46:14.041
She’ll join in the night long
festivities at the Sovabazar Rajbari

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:17.500
And in the end she’ll come back to the
Ganges and once again become clay.

00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:21.375
To fathom her… Hey!

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:28.875
You’re not going to stop unless You
turn this place into a junkyard. Right?

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.916
-Get out of here!

00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:33.125
-Sir! What a rascal!

00:46:35.708 --> 00:46:41.083
Who were you talking about?

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.625
Everybody’s Mother.

00:46:44.166 --> 00:46:45.541
Goddess Durga.

00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:48.416
It seems you’ve
forgotten everything.

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:52.708
How much longer are you going to
tell these stories to be in business?

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.041
Everything is fake
and made up to you.

00:46:56.166 --> 00:46:58.291
My grandfather’s grandfather…

00:46:59.166 --> 00:47:01.333
To make it simple for you…

00:47:01.666 --> 00:47:06.625
My father’s father’s
father’s father…

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:12.041
…was the priest in Kumurtuli’s
Abhay Charan Mitra’s house.

00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:21.291
If I tell you how much rice was used
in the offering, you’ll go into shock.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.416
So, the Mother Goddess ate at
Kumurtuli’s Abhay Charan Mitra’s home…

00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:26.708
And where did she dressed up ?

00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:29.833
These are adages from old Kolkata,
son.

00:47:30.541 --> 00:47:35.958
She would wear her jewellery at
Jorashanko’s Shibkrishna Dan’s house.

00:47:37.416 --> 00:47:41.833
She eats at Kumurtuli’s
Abhay Charan Mitra’s home.

00:47:42.833 --> 00:47:47.625
And she attends the festivities
at Sovabazar’s Rajbari.

00:47:48.166 --> 00:47:50.041
Your generation doesn’t
know these things.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.583
And even if you did
you don’t believe in it.

00:47:53.208 --> 00:47:54.291
I do, sir

00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:56.833
Bless me, sir.

00:48:00.625 --> 00:48:03.916
Only Goddess Durga knows,
If I believed me.

00:48:04.083 --> 00:48:04.833
-Mr. Storyteller!

00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:07.833
-Hey! Will you please leave?

00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:09.708
-This old man is killing me!

00:48:09.708 --> 00:48:10.666
-Disgusting!

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:17.125
Do you know where
Shibkrishna Dan’s house is?

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:17.833
-Yes.

00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:18.416
-Okay.

00:48:19.125 --> 00:48:21.500
-We want to go there exactly.
-Got it.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.458
Who is Shibkrishna Dan ?

00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:26.083
Why are we going to his place ?

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.166
Because Asutosh’s
wife gets dressed there.

00:48:28.708 --> 00:48:32.083
What? Why are you
using my dad’s name?

00:48:32.333 --> 00:48:33.750
I’m not taking about your dad.

00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:35.791
Asutosh is Lord
Shiva’s other name.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.083
Lord Shiva’s other
name was Somenath too.

00:48:40.166 --> 00:48:42.583
-And what’s Shiva’s wife’s name ?
-Durga. Correct.

00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:50.041
Where the wife dresses up…

00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:52.500
Somnath was
referring to this house.

00:48:53.166 --> 00:48:54.958
According to the adages…

00:48:55.416 --> 00:48:57.916
Goddes Durga wears her jewellery in
Jorashanko’s Shibkrishna Dan’s House.

00:48:59.375 --> 00:49:00.250
-Excellent! Let’s go.

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:00.875
-Where are you going?

00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:02.416
Ain’t we going in?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.208
What does the riddle say?

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.875
The lane where the
wide wears her clothes…

00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:08.916
How many does Hutum Byancha’s
collection of ponytails expose?

00:49:09.166 --> 00:49:10.333
-Remember the
number of ponytails?

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.916
-51. Then what can we deduce?

00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:16.750
Absolutely nothing!

00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:22.750
Please pray to Goddess
Durga for some brains.

00:49:23.208 --> 00:49:25.500
What are you trying to say ?

00:49:30.166 --> 00:49:33.375
Do you think I am not smart?

00:49:34.208 --> 00:49:36.125
You’re losing your mind.

00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:40.666
Hey, 51 ponytails mean…

00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:42.583
…we’ve to look for
house number 51?

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.750
You just prayed once and she
has already sent you some brains.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:48.708
Shut up!

00:49:50.708 --> 00:49:53.791
How many does Hutum Byancha’s
collection of ponytails expose?

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:59.250
If you are looking carefully,
you’ll arrive Hastings’ revenge on 5-8-75

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.750
-Sir,
do you know if Nandakumar lives here?

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.458
-Nandakumar Ghosh?
-Yes, This house?

00:50:06.583 --> 00:50:08.041
-Yeah, he lives in this house.

00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:09.958
Let’s go in. Come quickly…

00:50:50.583 --> 00:50:52.833
How are you related to Somnath ?

00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:54.958
I’m not related.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.500
This is my friend, Brishti.

00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:01.250
Do you know Asutosh Singho?

00:51:02.666 --> 00:51:05.291
Asutosh from the Singho house?

00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:06.041
Yes

00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:07.625
Brishti is his daughter.

00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:10.000
Asutosh and
Somnath were friends.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.333
He has passed away
a long time back.

00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:13.458
Who?

00:51:15.166 --> 00:51:16.250
-Somnath?

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.833
-Yes.

00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:26.375
Somnath… …has passed away?

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.750
Yes,he passed away.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.833
And before he passed away,
he sent Asutosh a letter.

00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:36.208
That’s where the riddle was.

00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:41.000
The solution to the riddle will lead
to an object of great historical value.

00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:45.916
So far, it has led us to you.

00:51:47.958 --> 00:51:50.625
Somnath was a curious guy.

00:51:52.416 --> 00:51:58.333
I’ve had many students
but no one like Somnath.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.416
He respected me a lot.

00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:08.333
I felt… How long it has been?

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.791
-Must be 25 years.. 27 years…

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.750
-27 years…

00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:20.791
Somnath had sent me a
letter before he passed away.

00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:25.625
If anyone came to
me with that riddle..

00:52:26.958 --> 00:52:29.291
I was supposed
to hand this over.

00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:34.125
I’ve been waiting for too long.

00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.333
But no one came.

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.750
I have lost my vision too.

00:52:42.958 --> 00:52:44.833
And you ‘ve finally come.

00:52:48.958 --> 00:52:50.958
Take it.

00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:59.750
I am free of my responsibility.

00:53:02.416 --> 00:53:05.583
Didn’t Somnath tell
you anything else?

00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:09.000
No… Nothing else…

00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:13.458
“The sky blue glass in English
puts the Englishman in jail”

00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:18.541
“The birthday of the best translator
will take you home without fail”

00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:20.750
Nine.

00:53:24.125 --> 00:53:25.875
The sky blue glass in English?

00:53:29.916 --> 00:53:32.750
Can you please stop
with the history already?

00:53:33.208 --> 00:53:33.750
Why?

00:53:34.958 --> 00:53:37.333
Because I can’t spend the rest
of my life with a crazy person.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.666
Somnath Das went
crazy because of History.

00:53:41.291 --> 00:53:45.083
And I think people who study
History also go mad like Somnath Das.

00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:46.791
-May Goddess Durga
give you some brains.

00:53:46.791 --> 00:53:47.250
-Shut up.

00:53:48.083 --> 00:53:50.500
Somnath Das is a crazy guy.

00:53:50.625 --> 00:53:51.833
And I’m sure he’s alive.

00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:58.541
He is secretly sending Dad those notes. And he’s
having a good laugh at our expense, Rubbish!

00:54:00.833 --> 00:54:02.625
-Let’s go. We’ll be late.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.375
-Where do we have to go ?

00:54:04.083 --> 00:54:06.958
You forgot we’ve to
go to Ranjana’s party?

00:54:07.083 --> 00:54:09.000
Please don’t take me there.

00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:10.291
I feel very uncomfortable.

00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:11.958
-Stop your nonsense. Let’s go.
-Please…

00:54:12.375 --> 00:54:13.791
There’ll be a lot
of traffic in Behala.

00:54:13.833 --> 00:54:17.208
We’ll take James
Long Sarani. Come on.

00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:19.000
James… Hey, Brishti…

00:54:19.333 --> 00:54:22.041
-Can you drop me
off at the library?

00:54:22.166 --> 00:54:23.666
-Am I your driver?

00:54:43.791 --> 00:54:45.958
What’s the first thing that comes to
your mind when you hear the word sky?

00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:48.583
Here we go again.

00:54:49.208 --> 00:54:49.958
Tell me.

00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:52.583
-Sky blue, Indigo…

00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:54.125
-Indigo…

00:54:54.583 --> 00:54:56.166
Now,
give me another word for glass.

00:54:56.708 --> 00:54:57.458
-Mirror…

00:54:57.791 --> 00:54:58.500
-Great!

00:54:59.125 --> 00:55:00.333
That makes it “Nil Darpan” Which
is also called “The Indigo Mirror”.

00:55:00.958 --> 00:55:03.125
Yes, that’s a famous play
ny Dinabandhu Mitra. So?

00:55:03.708 --> 00:55:06.166
The British had
banned this play.

00:55:06.791 --> 00:55:09.583
But an Englishman… Take
the James Long Sarani.

00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:10.708
-Okay, sir.
-What were you saying?

00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:15.333
An Englishman secretly got it translated and sent
it to England. He was sent to prison for this.

00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:20.916
“The sky blue glass in English
puts the Englishman in jail

00:55:21.916 --> 00:55:22.541
Who was he ?

00:55:23.583 --> 00:55:24.833
Reverend James Long.

00:55:25.416 --> 00:55:28.791
-Are we on James Long Sarani.
-Yes, sir.

00:55:30.416 --> 00:55:33.625
“The birthday of the best translator will take
you home without fail” What does this mean?

00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:40.041
It is said that Michael Madhusudan Dutt
translated the play in English overnight.

00:55:40.666 --> 00:55:44.291
And his date of
birth is 25-1-1824.

00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:47.916
25 by 1… Stop the car!

00:55:48.541 --> 00:55:49.500
What happened?

00:55:54.375 --> 00:55:56.000
Where are you going?

00:55:58.333 --> 00:56:02.458
25/1… 25/1… Brishti…

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.208
Dinabandhu Sweet Shop!

00:56:14.125 --> 00:56:16.333
-Somnath Das… My dad talked about him.
-Somnath Das…

00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:17.958
But that’s a long time ago.

00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:19.708
-Can we meet your father?

00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:20.541
-Yes.

00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:23.166
We’re Sorry.

00:56:23.458 --> 00:56:26.750
He used to say Somnath
Das was a chatterbox.

00:56:27.125 --> 00:56:30.750
What was the guy’s name?
Michael Mitra… Dinabandhu Dutt.

00:56:30.916 --> 00:56:34.083
James Long Sarani…
Michael… Please continue…

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.458
There’s some kind of
connection with our shop.

00:56:37.041 --> 00:56:38.541
That’s why he came
to meet my dad.

00:56:38.958 --> 00:56:41.250
He had all the
information about Kolkata.

00:56:41.416 --> 00:56:43.583
My dad also indulged him.

00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:46.666
They were like
two peas in a pod.

00:56:46.666 --> 00:56:47.125
Okay.

00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:48.791
Where are you going?

00:56:49.208 --> 00:56:49.833
Wait one minute.

00:56:50.333 --> 00:56:52.166
Hey, bring a ledikeni sweet.

00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:53.666
-We don’t want
to eat your sweets.

00:56:54.208 --> 00:56:55.791
-I’m not offering either.

00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:06.416
Drop the sweet.

00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:18.958
Dad, I kept my word.

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.791
What is all this ?

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.750
That I don’t know.

00:57:23.083 --> 00:57:25.750
Somnath had sent
a letter to my dad.

00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:29.041
Before he died,
He passed the instruction to me.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.000
It says…

00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:36.375
“What made this sweet’s father famous,
Seven of those must be put beside it.”

00:57:37.458 --> 00:57:40.000
Who is ledikeni sweet’s father ?

00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:42.250
It can be any of the sweets…

00:57:42.541 --> 00:57:45.500
You can dig deeper into the mystery
of sweets but please pay me Rs. 10.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:56.416
Amirchand,I’ll not get any
part of my father’s property.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:59.291
Brishti will inherit everything.

00:58:01.375 --> 00:58:05.250
In this situation,
if I can’t get the money,

00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:06.458
I’ll lose the shop.

00:58:07.666 --> 00:58:10.041
I can’t get a loan
from anywhere.

00:58:10.041 --> 00:58:16.750
Abhiraj,
your credit history is scary!

00:58:17.833 --> 00:58:24.041
How can I trust you
with so much money?

00:58:24.458 --> 00:58:27.708
But my family will lose
it’s respect if the shop…

00:58:27.708 --> 00:58:30.500
You Bengalis might
not have anything else…

00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:35.833
…but you care a lot about
respect and prestige. Don’t you?

00:58:37.125 --> 00:58:41.041
Abhiraj, I’m a businessman.

00:58:42.166 --> 00:58:45.958
I’m offering an
open deal to you.

00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:49.750
Deliver the object.

00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:54.166
And take your money.

00:58:55.458 --> 00:58:59.208
It won’t be a loan.
Consider it an income.

00:59:00.291 --> 00:59:01.833
You don’t get it.

00:59:02.916 --> 00:59:04.666
-There’s too much sentiment…

00:59:04.666 --> 00:59:05.583
-Then let it be.

00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:08.750
Live the rest of your
life with your sentiment.

00:59:10.166 --> 00:59:12.333
Enjoy the songs of Tagore.

00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:20.166
“The unforgettable memories
of the days gone by…”

00:59:23.458 --> 00:59:27.750
He buried a ledikeni
sweet? Really?

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.916
Now,
you know how crazy your friend was.

00:59:31.166 --> 00:59:33.041
How can I say that?

00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:37.375
Because the last two puzzles…

00:59:37.583 --> 00:59:38.416
-Brishti! Brishti!

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:42.958
-Now what? Lady
Canning.. How could I forget?

00:59:43.333 --> 00:59:45.125
What about Lady Canning?

00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:45.750
-Lady Canning… -Please sit…

00:59:45.833 --> 00:59:49.166
Lord Canning’s wife’s
name was Charlotte Canning.

00:59:49.416 --> 00:59:50.666
She was called Lady Canning.

00:59:50.958 --> 00:59:54.541
The sweet that was created in honour
of her coming to India was ledikeni.

00:59:54.708 --> 00:59:55.791
Ledikeni from Lady Canning.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.833
But what was Lady Canning’s
father’s famous creation? I’ll tell you.

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:02.291
Bhim Nag created the
special sweet ledikeni.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.041
That’s why Bhim Nag
is the father of ledikeni.

01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:13.750
-Thank you.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:15.875
-Thank you.

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:19.416
So what does burying
the ledikeni mean?

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:22.333
Lady canning’s grave.

01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:23.125
Barrackpore.

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.375
Barrackpore.

01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.833
Brishti..

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:31.458
BHIM CHANDRA NAG

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.958
The next letter is going
to be delivered by ants.

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:42.083
How?

01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.833
Who else is going to
come for your sweets here?

01:01:45.875 --> 01:01:46.708
Stop kidding.

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:54.500
Lady Canning was a painter.

01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:59.833
She had made some really
famous paintings of India.

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:06.041
She passed away with her
head on Lord Canning’s shoulder.

01:02:07.708 --> 01:02:09.916
Lord Canning passed
away soon after.

01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:16.791
And since then he has been
protecting his wife’s grave.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.000
This is called true love.

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:26.333
When I die, will you still be
reading “Hutum pyancha’s Tales?”

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:30.458
What rubbish! Hear me out.

01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:32.666
-Do6n’t ne mad at me.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.666
-I don’t like all this.

01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:35.625
-I was just kiddi6ng.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:36.125
- Nope.

01:02:36.666 --> 01:02:37.500
My sweetie pie…

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.791
How is Somnath?

01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:48.458
He has passed away
almost 27 years ago…

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.833
-Passed away?

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:50.416
- Yes.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.000
He loved me a lot…

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.791
-Did he come here often?

01:02:56.791 --> 01:03:00.833
-Yes. Yes, quiet often.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:05.208
We would chat for hours…

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:14.791
He had sent me a
letter many years back.

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:19.083
How are you related to him?

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:22.041
No,we’re not related.

01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:29.625
But the way you talk… Your…

01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.333
I think we’re being followed.

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:19.041
A man was murdered
in front of us.

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:22.333
A birthday gift…

01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:26.125
What can be worth a man’s life?

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.458
The garderner seemed to think
you and Somnath Das were similar…

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:32.041
They killed him,
5before he could say anything, Brishti.

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:37.416
Listen,
I think you should stop your research.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.458
Something’s not right.

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:45.375
I would have agreed
with you before.

01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:49.166
But now I want
to see how it ends.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:56.000
“The child sleeps
and the city is quiet

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.083
That’s when the
Marathas attacked.”

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:01.083
“Sutanuti and Gobindopur
Were the last to be hacked.”

01:05:02.125 --> 01:05:04.416
“On the path of the ditch
Stands the Native Zamindar.”

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:07.458
“It took a turn around the villa
Where stood the challenger.”

01:05:08.416 --> 01:05:10.875
“Look carefully
arou6nd the area”

01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:14.416
“Baghbazar’s nine gems In
the earthquake’s hysteria.”

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:32.875
-I’m sure you can understand…

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:35.208
-Yes,
I do… Let’s see what happens.

01:05:35.416 --> 01:05:36.166
Thank you so much.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.583
- Good bye. -Good bye.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:49.708
Sir.

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:28.541
Don’t worry. I’ve spoken
to the commissioner.

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:31.000
There won’t be any
harassment. Don’t worry.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.916
Sir,
what do you think the gift is?

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:40.750
What can be so valuable,

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.458
That a man was murdered for it ?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.458
What was he trying to say?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.916
You know, what I think,
Soham is…

01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:52.208
Why do you think the
two incidents are related?

01:06:53.875 --> 01:07:01.166
You’ve met a lot of other people,
But nothing happened to them…

01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:02.791
Okay, sir.

01:07:08.583 --> 01:07:11.083
-Sir, can I ask you something?

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:11.958
-Of course.

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:16.083
Why did you choose me ?

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:21.625
You’ve written a book like
“Bengal’s Mirror”. You could have…

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:28.791
And I might just keep
this precious gift for myself.

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.666
I’m a good judge of character.

01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:40.333
Thank you, Sir.

01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:47.875
JAGAT SETH’S MURDER

01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:23.750
-Hi.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:24.166
-Hi.

01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:27.708
How is your film coming along?

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.916
Great! It’s my dream project.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.125
See…

01:08:32.666 --> 01:08:33.208
Very nice.

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:39.625
You have to move around a
lot to get the footage, right ?

01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:42.250
Must be very hectic?

01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:45.583
It is but I enjoy it.

01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:51.583
You were at Barrackpore today,
isn’t it?

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.500
And before this Jorashanko?

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:59.000
Yes,
I have to go to a lot of places.

01:09:01.083 --> 01:09:06.791
It’s really strange how your schedule
coincides with whatever Soham and I are.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.250
Weren’t you there at
James Long Sarani too?

01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:14.750
These coincidences are becoming
too frequent. Do something about it.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:56.208
Sir

01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:01.708
“The child sleeps and the city is quiet
That’s when the Marathas attacked”

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.583
1742…

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:08.125
20,000 Marathi
soldiers attacked Bengal.

01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:12.625
Innumerable villages
were looted and plundered.

01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:17.541
The villagers started moving towards
Kolkata to seek refuse under the British.

01:10:18.208 --> 01:10:26.625
To secure the perimeter,
The English started digging a ditch.

01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:29.083
-That’s the Maratha ditch. -Yes…

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:33.000
Like it says in the riddle… “Sutanuti and
Gobindopur were the last to be hacked.”

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:39.250
This ditch was supposed to
be 7 miles long and 21 feet wide.

01:10:39.958 --> 01:10:41.791
It used to be called
Upper Circular Road.

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:45.250
It was later renamed Acharya
Prafulla Chandra Roy road.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.750
The plan was to
keep the ditch straight.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.041
It would go along the
road that we’re on right now.

01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:54.666
But… “On the path of the ditch
Stands the Native Zamindar”…

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:57.083
It’s referring to
Gobindo Ram Mitra.

01:10:57.958 --> 01:11:02.666
He was the first Zamindar
under the English rule.

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:06.833
So, the British would call him
“Native” or “Black zamindar”.

01:11:07.541 --> 01:11:11.791
So, Gobindo Ram Mitra’s
villa was on the ditch’s path.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.458
It came straight
up to the villa then…

01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.708
The Maratha ditch
had to take a turn.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.833
“It took a turn around the villa
Where stood the challenger”…

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:24.416
I’ve read about this in
Dad’s “Bengal’s Mirror.”

01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:26.708
Isn’t it ?

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:29.208
Gobindo Ram Mitra was very
close to the English officials.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.833
So, the ditch had to
take a turn from his villa.

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:35.416
Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, the literary
society of Bengal was part of this villa.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.208
Look, Mr. Mittal…

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:45.000
You’ve been promising this
to me for the last 25 years.

01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:49.666
But you’ve yet to trace it out.

01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:55.375
And you’re
completely out of track.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:12:03.958
Sir… I’m very much in but
the price is not negotiable.

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:05.666
-35 crores.

01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:07.875
-35 crores?

01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:10.000
This is too much!

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:11.000
Sir…

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:14.500
The grip is of pure gold.

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:21.666
And it has five of the
world’s most precious stones.

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:32.000
Spinel,
ruby… Diamond,emerald,sapphire.

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:37.625
Plus it has got
the historical value.

01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:42.583
Sir, 35 crores is a fair deal.

01:12:43.166 --> 01:12:48.666
Moreover,
I have another thing to offer you, sir.

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:51.291
A nose ring.

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:57.250
With many antique diamonds.

01:12:57.958 --> 01:13:03.291
Sir,
I’ll give it to you at a discounted rate.

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:11.916
Please read it out
one more time…

01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:15.708
“Look carefully
arou6nd the area”

01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:18.416
“Baghbazar’s nine gems In
the earthquake’s hysteria.”

01:13:18.458 --> 01:13:19.458
“In the earthquake’s hysteria.”

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:21.625
In the 1730…

01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.916
Gobindo Ram Mitra built
the Nine Gems temple.

01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:28.375
It’s said it was taller… …than
the Ochterlony Monument.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.333
It was razed to the ground
during the earthquake of 1840.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:33.291
The nine gems…

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:35.250
It must be here somewhere…

01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:38.708
Excuse me…

01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:44.333
Do you k6now a6ny place,
shop or home which is called “nine gems”?

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:46.041
-Nine gems? -Yes.

01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:47.083
That’s not here.

01:13:47.833 --> 01:13:49.541
There were nine gems
in Vikramaditya’s court.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:50.000
-No, no…

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.666
-We know that too.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:52.916
What an idiot!

01:13:53.125 --> 01:13:54.041
Are there any…

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:56.625
Who did you call an idiot?
-Maybe a shop or a house_? Anything_?

01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:59.166
-There’s nothing.
No gems or jewels…

01:13:59.333 --> 01:13:59.875
-Are you sure_?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.416
-This is my neighbourhood.
I’m very sure.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.083
-What I mea6nt was…
-Let’s go. No need to teach history now.

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:11.625
Where are you _? I’ve
been waiting for so long.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:13.041
-What happened?

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.416
-What should we do ?

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:18.041
I haven’t eaten
anything since morning.

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:19.666
Let’s grab a bite and think.

01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:22.541
Come straight from
Bangiya Sahitya Parishad…

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:23.666
It’ll be on your right.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:25.458
Yes, on the right,
the Black Pagoda.

01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:27.416
“Baghbazar’s nine gems In
the earthquake’s hysteria.”

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.166
Since the Nine Gems Temple
was built by the Black Zamindar…

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:41.916
So,
the British called it the Black Pagoda.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:46.916
Hello!

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:52.958
Greetings, Dad!

01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:55.541
Have you reached the village?

01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.791
Say hello to Mom.

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:01.958
How is everyone?

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.416
All good?

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:07.208
What?

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.791
She had another baby?

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:11.708
-How wonderful…

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:13.541
-Please ask him about letter.

01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:17.416
Give my love to her…

01:15:17.416 --> 01:15:18.916
Ask about the letter.

01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:23.958
Send me a photo of
the baby on WhatsApp.

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:27.041
I’ll put it up in the Black Pagoda…
Please ask about the letter.

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:32.958
-Dad, did any Somnath…

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:33.875
-Somnath Das.

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:37.791
Did you know a Bengali
gentleman called Somnath Das?

01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:38.958
You knew him?

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:40.208
He was your friend?

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:43.250
Yeah, Gobindo Ram’s people
have become famous in Kolkata.

01:15:43.375 --> 01:15:44.750
Which Gobindo Ram
are you talki6ng about?

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:48.000
My father… Owner
of this Black Pagoda.

01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:49.958
Gobindo Ram Mitra,
The owner of Black Pagoda…

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:50.958
-Shut up.

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:52.958
- I was talking to them.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:56.916
Not Mitra, Gobindo Ram Sahoo,
My dad’s name… Bless you.

01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:57.458
-Bless you.

01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:58.458
-That wasn’t for you.

01:15:58.666 --> 01:16:01.458
I’m congratulating my
dad for devicing the lock.

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:02.375
What lock?

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.416
Hold on for a moment.

01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:10.916
My dad can make a
special lock with numbers.

01:16:11.416 --> 01:16:17.041
He made it when he was working
at the Cossipore Gun Shell Factory.

01:16:18.125 --> 01:16:19.208
What was his name ? Somnath Das.

01:16:19.416 --> 01:16:20.250
-Somnath Das. -Somnath Das.

01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:24.750
He bought one of these
special locks from my father.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.958
What’s so special
about this lock?

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.666
There’s a layer of
gunpowder inside this lock.

01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:34.791
And it’ll only open with
the right combination.

01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:36.583
What if someone
tries to break this lock?

01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:47.208
The lock will burst. The person
might get injured or even die.

01:16:49.416 --> 01:16:50.791
Now,ask him about the letter.

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:52.666
What’s the hurry?

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:53.666
I’m asking him.

01:16:53.666 --> 01:16:54.583
-Please, ask him…

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:55.291
-Yeah, we’re in a hurry.

01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:56.500
-So, Dad… -Please…

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:00.333
Do you have any letter
from Somnath Das?

01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:02.250
-You do? He does.
-He does have the letter?

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:05.125
There’s a lady here who
has come for the letter.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.000
When are you coming back ?

01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:08.541
-One month later?

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.375
-One month… You can
take the letter after a month.

01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:13.000
Please do something, Brishti…

01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:15.166
A month… Please
figure something out.

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:16.791
- Is the letter important ?

01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:17.375
-Very important.

01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.500
Wait… Hold on…

01:17:19.666 --> 01:17:21.875
Not you, Dad. I’m telling them.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.291
Do something for me…

01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:26.208
I’m sending you
this lady’s number.

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:31.416
Take a photo of the letter.
Send it to her on WhatsApp.

01:17:32.041 --> 01:17:35.625
Okay. Bye, Dad.

01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:40.458
What a coincidence!

01:17:42.166 --> 01:17:45.416
-Gobindo Ram Mitra
and Gobindo Ram Sahoo.

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:48.458
Message…

01:17:53.041 --> 01:17:54.375
-Hey, it’s him.

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:57.541
-Let me see. Let me see.

01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:03.583
“The place where first
Laxmi Festival’s offering grew

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:08.375
“The colourful reflection on the
lake Changed it’s name anew.”

01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:12.833
“The object of the reflection is
Where Mashusudan took his vow.”

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:19.291
“The high priest of the ritual
Is the father of the house now.”

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:20.708
Six.

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:24.458
Why is there a number
at the end of each letter?

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:32.625
Maybe it’s the
combination to the locker…

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.541
Where Das’s gift might be.

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:37.833
Yeah but where is the locker?

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:47.625
“Madhusudan’s vow”…

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.208
Okay, let’s go.

01:18:56.791 --> 01:19:01.708
“The object of reflection is
Where Madhusudan took his vow.”

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:04.625
Excuse me. 2000 please.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:05.666
For what_?

01:19:05.666 --> 01:19:10.041
My liver doesn’t allow me
to drink hooch anymore.

01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:12.750
And my health is gone.

01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:15.458
Doc has asked
me to drink scotch.

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:18.458
But my father… He
has no aristrocracy.

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:19.583
He’s a country mouse.

01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:23.125
-You look like you drink.

01:19:23.166 --> 01:19:23.958
-No, I don’t.

01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:25.541
Oh my God! That’s strange!

01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:27.750
You don’t drink!

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:29.791
Do you prefer baby food?

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:32.083
Please give up the liquor,
Chandu.

01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:34.125
And save your liver.

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:37.583
What are you saying?

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:40.750
Everything is
going to rot anyway.

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:44.125
This is the way of the world.

01:19:44.458 --> 01:19:46.833
Do6n’t worry. Just dri6nk.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:48.208
And give me 2000 bucks.

01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:50.583
Hey, just get out of here.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.541
Why are you hitting
my son again?

01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:55.416
He just wanted his medicine.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:56.750
I’ll tell you what to do.

01:19:57.333 --> 01:20:00.666
Give him some folidol
first thing in the morning.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:04.500
-What should I give him?
-Folidol.

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:07.083
No one understands my pain.

01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:08.166
-Why don’t you
take some folidol too.

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:09.583
Why are you still
standing there?

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:10.791
Get out of here.

01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:15.875
No Mom… This is disgusting!

01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:18.375
Sakhhi Gopal.

01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:24.041
-Did he want money? -Yes.

01:20:24.583 --> 01:20:27.875
My son is a spoilt brat.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:34.375
Not everyone is
fortunate like Somnath.

01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:48.041
Time’s up.

01:20:49.625 --> 01:20:52.208
What are the offerings
in the Laxmi festival?

01:20:54.041 --> 01:20:56.625
-Fruits,sweets…

01:20:56.708 --> 01:20:58.500
-Apart from that?

01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:03.041
Sweet coco6nut fritters…

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:06.750
Nope, it’s something else.

01:22:33.041 --> 01:22:35.333
-Here you go… -That’s enough…

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:42.625
The fragrance of the Gobindobhog
rice is just so special… Isn’t it Asutosh?

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:48.000
Feed him properly… Don’t be shy.

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:53.291
This Goddess Laxmi’s
blessing… Please eat.

01:22:53.541 --> 01:22:57.958
Here you go… Have
you seen Chandu?

01:22:58.416 --> 01:23:00.333
Who knows?

01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:04.500
Why aren’t you eating?

01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:14.250
You’ve figured out the
first part of puzzle, right ?

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:14.916
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.250
You’re not going anywhere
till you finish your food.

01:23:17.375 --> 01:23:18.458
Shut up and sit.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.375
Sit down and eat.

01:23:27.083 --> 01:23:28.958
What’s wrong? Feeling unwell?

01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:32.291
I’ve got it! Eat slowly.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.833
Why have you brought
me to Lal Bazaar?

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:40.583
Come…

01:23:41.333 --> 01:23:42.333
Please tell me.

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:46.125
Lal Bazar’s Lal Mohan Seth was
one of the oldest residents of Kolkata.

01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:50.625
The rice offering to their deity
Gobindo was grown right here.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:53.541
-And that rice is called Gobindobhog. Right!
-Gobindobhog.

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:55.166
And what about the
reflection on the lake ?

01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:57.125
This Old Mission
Church’s reflection…

01:23:57.125 --> 01:23:58.208
…would fall on the lake.

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:01.041
The church was red. That’s
why since the reflection was red…

01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:02.375
It was called Lal
Dighi or Red Lake.

01:24:02.958 --> 01:24:05.291
And the object of thet reflection is this,
the Old Mission Church.

01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:09.125
-And this is where Madhusudan was initiated…
-Oh God!

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:12.208
Madhusudan Dutt was influenced
by Krishna Mohan Bandopadhyay.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.916
And he converted to Christianity here
in the Old Mission Church. Now, let’s go.

01:24:16.416 --> 01:24:21.375
The high priest
is then the Father?

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:45.791
This is a strange coincidence,
My son.

01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:49.375
My name is also Krishna
Mohan Bandopadhyay.

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:52.833
Somnath met me quite often.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.125
He had a lot of questions about
the Old churches of Kolkata.

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:00.333
This is the letter.

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:02.875
I’m free today.

01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:09.000
You said you’re not
related to Somnath.

01:25:10.666 --> 01:25:11.625
No,we’re not related.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:13.333
Strange.

01:25:15.625 --> 01:25:19.958
The same gait,
the same sharpness…

01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:21.291
Strangely…

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:25.083
You and Somnath…

01:26:55.708 --> 01:26:57.041
Have you noticed something?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.791
Everyone who has met Somnath
like the gardener,the Father…

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:07.083
They were both trying
to tell you something.

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.291
And they are the
ones who got killed.

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:15.791
No.. Jorashankho’s Nando
kumar didn’t say anything…

01:27:16.333 --> 01:27:18.083
He has also met Somnath.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.541
Nando Kumar didn’t
say anything to me.

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:28.666
Because he has
lost his eyesight.

01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:35.375
A storm is brewing.

01:27:39.791 --> 01:27:40.958
Sakhhi Gopal…

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:43.958
- You know everything,
don’t you ?

01:27:44.291 --> 01:27:45.625
-What do I know?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.666
Why did you say that to me,
Sakhhi Gopal?

01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:56.666
What did I say?

01:27:58.125 --> 01:27:59.541
When Chandu was
asking for money…

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:02.750
You’d said you were not as
fortunate as Somnath Das.

01:28:03.916 --> 01:28:04.916
Why did you say that?

01:28:06.583 --> 01:28:13.375
And the day I had moved in,
you said I’m smarter.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:17.125
Who am I smarter than,
Sakhhi Gopal?

01:28:19.333 --> 01:28:22.750
-I don’t know what you’re talking about…
-You know everything…

01:28:23.375 --> 01:28:24.583
Please,
don’t keep secrets anymore.

01:28:26.083 --> 01:28:30.500
My gait, my way of talking…
It’s all too familiar. Isn’t it?

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:35.583
Who am I like, Sakhhi Gopal?

01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:51.750
You… Wait…

01:29:01.666 --> 01:29:06.000
If anyone gets to know… I’ll
be thrown out of this house.

01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:24.083
Doomsday is here, Asutosh!

01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:27.708
Goddess Laxmi's
nose ring is missing

01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:42.208
What happened?

01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:43.875
Where were you?

01:30:44.958 --> 01:30:47.875
-I should have told you…
-What’s wrong?

01:30:48.833 --> 01:30:50.416
You’ve been misbehaving
since yesterday.

01:30:52.333 --> 01:30:55.000
I’ll explain it to
you in your way.

01:30:55.833 --> 01:30:57.625
What are you talking about?

01:30:58.166 --> 01:30:59.916
-What did I do ?

01:30:59.916 --> 01:31:01.291
- What was the riddle?

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:05.708
“Thanks to the Briton, Permanent is the arrangement
Kali resides in Shankar’s heart Since times ancient”

01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:11.041
It’s reffering to Lord Cornwallis’
Permanent Settlement.

01:31:12.041 --> 01:31:14.708
This gave rise to a new class of workers,
the official clerks, Under the Zamindari.

01:31:16.041 --> 01:31:20.375
I went to Bidhan Sarani formerly
known as the Cornwalis Street.

01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:23.000
THANTHANIA KALI TEMPLE

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:23.958
1110/1424

01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:26.250
In 1110,
according to the Bengali calendar,

01:31:26.916 --> 01:31:33.916
Shankar Ghosh built this
Kali Temple and the idol.

01:31:34.875 --> 01:31:42.500
And that’s why,” Kali resides in
Shankar’s heart Since times ancient”…

01:31:43.708 --> 01:31:46.666
The same words can
mean several things.

01:31:46.958 --> 01:31:51.583
It might be Shankar Ghosh
or Lord Shankar or.. Or?

01:31:52.166 --> 01:31:57.250
I’m doing this work with such
enthusiasm as a student of History…

01:31:58.541 --> 01:31:59.750
But I might have
some other end to it.

01:32:00.541 --> 01:32:01.500
Isn’t it Brishti ?

01:32:04.291 --> 01:32:05.541
What’s up with you?

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:10.625
“Everyday devotees bow down their heads Under
their feet is where the last clue is embedded.”

01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:19.041
“He requested for the job in the cashbook
Bidyasunder fetched him the title of Kaviranjan”

01:32:19.666 --> 01:32:27.333
“Check the Bagbazar Library’s north-east corner
“All the rejected tales will have a merger.”

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:29.958
One.

01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:35.000
“He requested for
the job in the cashbook

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:40.416
Ram Prasad Sen was employed as an accountant
In the Mitra household of Bagbazar.

01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:43.083
And in that cashbook,
he wrote his songs.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.166
“Give me the caretaker’s job I am
a faithful devotee, Goddess Kali.”

01:32:47.375 --> 01:32:50.041
“Bidyasunder fetched
him the title of Kaviranjan”

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:55.625
He wrote the epic “Bidya Sundar” At the
request of Nadia’s King Krishna Chandra.

01:32:56.458 --> 01:32:58.708
The King was so happy that he
bestowed the “Kaviranjan” title on him.

01:33:00.916 --> 01:33:04.833
Now, you know the riddle
talks about Ram Prasad Sen.

01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:10.416
Where are you going?

01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:13.458
Bagbazar Library…

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.291
That’s where the object…

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:18.041
I’ve told you this too…

01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:21.708
I’m really stupid, Brishti.

01:34:08.666 --> 01:34:10.083
Where is the prince?

01:34:12.416 --> 01:34:19.041
My little prince,
who did you sell the real thing to ?

01:34:19.541 --> 01:34:22.208
Believe me, I didn’t know.

01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:24.208
I thought this was the original.

01:34:24.208 --> 01:34:25.083
Shut up, you idiot.

01:34:27.833 --> 01:34:29.000
Don’t say another word.

01:34:30.541 --> 01:34:31.375
What is this ?

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:32.125
What is this ?

01:34:33.583 --> 01:34:35.083
Listen to me carefully, Abhiraj.

01:34:36.166 --> 01:34:37.208
Listen very carefully.

01:34:38.166 --> 01:34:46.541
I’ll destroy you if you don’t
bring me the original nose ring.

01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:52.708
One phone call and the bank
will take possession of your shop.

01:34:53.958 --> 01:34:56.208
Give me a phone.

01:34:57.083 --> 01:35:02.000
I’ll ruin your entire family.

01:35:03.083 --> 01:35:07.666
Who am I? Amirchand Mittal

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:13.125
okey. Give me some more time.

01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:19.333
Yeah?

01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:25.000
Yes,yes, follow him.

01:35:26.083 --> 01:35:28.541
I’m on my way.

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:32.958
-Admit it! Admit that you’ve stolen it.
-Please don’t hurt him.

01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:36.916
-You dishonest scum. Admit it.
-Let me go. I haven’t done anything.

01:35:37.125 --> 01:35:41.041
-You’ve stolen the nose ring…
-I haven’t stolen anything…

01:35:41.166 --> 01:35:45.166
-Abhi,Please stop…
-I haven’t stolen anything… Mom!

01:35:45.833 --> 01:35:48.208
-I don’t know anything…
-Tell me…

01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:51.083
Asutosh,
Please ask Abhi to stop.

01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:52.250
I haven’t stolen anything…

01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:56.166
My son is a drunk,
jobless guy. But he’s not a thief.

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:59.208
Please, ask him to stop,
Asutosh.

01:35:59.333 --> 01:36:04.333
-Soham,what’s the matter.
-Come with me. I’ll explain everything.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:09.916
The north-east corner…
Not that side. This way.

01:36:10.708 --> 01:36:12.958
Please ask him to stop.
He’s going to kill my son.

01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:14.750
-One good beating
and you’ll talk…

01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:18.541
-Abhi,
listen… Uncle,please save me.

01:36:18.791 --> 01:36:21.125
I swear I didn’t steal anything.

01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:22.416
Stop lying…
-I have not stolen anything…

01:36:22.416 --> 01:36:23.833
-Please let him go…
-I haven’t done anything…

01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:26.583
-I’m begging you please…
-I’ll finish you off today…

01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:29.791
-No… Please don’t hurt my
father… He doesn’t know anything.

01:36:30.041 --> 01:36:34.041
I stole it and sold it off.

01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:37.291
Mom…

01:36:46.708 --> 01:36:50.333
Mom… Mom…

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:06.791
Hey, hey, hey… Ram Prasad
Sen’s picture in the north-east corner.

01:37:07.083 --> 01:37:09.666
What are you doing, Soham?

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:15.833
My goodness!

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:20.916
I had heard about
it from Harinath.

01:37:21.291 --> 01:37:26.250
He was the librarian before me.
There’s a secret locker in this library.

01:37:26.916 --> 01:37:28.416
And it’s made of a special
gunpowder coating on the inside.

01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:33.250
-If anyone tries to break it…
-It’ll burst.

01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:37.666
Yes but how did you know ?

01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:43.541
I think Harinath and
Somnath Das did it together.

01:37:44.041 --> 01:37:48.041
Somnath Das… Who is Somnath Das?

01:37:52.916 --> 01:37:56.208
Dad, Chandu is not a thief.

01:37:57.416 --> 01:38:00.333
Why didn’t you stop Abhi when
he was going to hit Sakhhi Gopal?

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:01.750
You just stood there…

01:38:03.666 --> 01:38:06.541
How can I call my
own son a thief?

01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:16.416
This is the original.

01:38:19.666 --> 01:38:22.375
I knew Abhiraj is going
to do something like this.

01:38:22.541 --> 01:38:25.916
I made an exact replica.

01:38:27.208 --> 01:38:29.208
I replaced it a
couple of days back.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:39.416
How can I call my own son
a thief? That too in public…

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:43.291
That’s why it’s easier
to blame someone else.

01:38:44.916 --> 01:38:49.458
Throws one off the track…

01:38:50.666 --> 01:38:54.416
Especially in an
aristocatic family.

01:38:55.416 --> 01:38:58.291
We’re not going to live in
house after all the persecution.

01:38:58.833 --> 01:38:59.791
We’ll leave here.

01:39:00.208 --> 01:39:04.166
But before I leave
I’ll spill all the beans.

01:39:13.916 --> 01:39:15.291
The letters…

01:39:17.291 --> 01:39:23.500
Thanthania, one… 1

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:26.041
Nine, five, six, four, one.

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:31.750
Five,six,four,one.

01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:04.000
“The last remains of
Alinagar’s founder here lies

01:40:04.166 --> 01:40:07.041
Count the number
of grave lengthwise

01:40:07.333 --> 01:40:09.750
Now it’s time to cross the river

01:40:10.333 --> 01:40:13.208
You’ll reach the town’s north-east corner Covered
in dust, the founding father sleeps under the stair

01:40:13.416 --> 01:40:16.291
You’ll reach the town’s north-east corner Covered
in dust, the founding father sleeps under the stair

01:40:17.291 --> 01:40:20.416
Unique design of the
door you’ll find here

01:40:20.583 --> 01:40:23.791
The unique door on the west Will
lead you to a secret passageway

01:40:24.125 --> 01:40:27.291
Move past the number of rooms
You’d counted earlier in the day”

01:40:27.958 --> 01:40:31.166
What does this even mean?

01:40:57.125 --> 01:41:05.583
I’ve tolerated a lot of injustice
and disrespect Through the years…

01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:12.125
But today Sakhhi Gopal
will talk the witness stand.

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.875
You’ll reach the town’s north-east corner Covered
in dust, the founding father sleeps under the stair

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.666
Let me see… This is straight
out of the Arabian Nights.

01:41:20.458 --> 01:41:21.166
What next?

01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:23.583
We have to cross this tunnel

01:41:23.666 --> 01:41:24.416
and come here.

01:41:24.583 --> 01:41:26.541
-I’m very sure the object is here…
-Right but…

01:42:30.708 --> 01:42:35.541
Your father’s deeds… I feel
bad about sharing them with you.

01:42:38.125 --> 01:42:40.083
But today I have
to reveal everything.

01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:46.375
For many years now,
Just to keep up the appearances…

01:42:47.375 --> 01:42:50.625
Everything in this house
is mortgaged to Amirchand.

01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:54.166
He has not even
spared this house.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:03.083
And he’s not even wavered While
stabbing his friend in the back.

01:43:03.916 --> 01:43:05.458
This traitor!

01:43:06.166 --> 01:43:15.625
Look,
Asutosh… There’s no friendship in business.

01:43:16.458 --> 01:43:18.666
-Give me my money back.

01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:24.833
-Hear me out, Amirchand. How will I arrange
for so much money At such short notice?

01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:26.625
-Please give me some more time.

01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:30.875
-How much more, Asutosh?

01:43:31.208 --> 01:43:38.000
If you can’t repay the loan,
Mortgage something else.

01:43:40.875 --> 01:43:48.375
How about the nose
ring on Goddess Laxmi?

01:43:49.375 --> 01:43:50.458
You can give me that.

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:54.166
It’s an important
family heirloom.

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:57.375
Forget family history…

01:43:59.416 --> 01:44:01.083
Don’t forget you’re in debt.

01:44:01.083 --> 01:44:03.291
You have no respect.

01:44:07.166 --> 01:44:07.916
Hello.

01:44:10.291 --> 01:44:12.750
Tell me Somnath.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.208
Yeah, we can talk.

01:44:16.375 --> 01:44:22.500
What? Listen to me…
Listen to me carefully.

01:44:22.958 --> 01:44:26.833
Everyone will not
know it’s value.

01:44:27.541 --> 01:44:29.083
Don’t tell anyone else about it.

01:44:30.666 --> 01:44:31.958
Keep the object with you.

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.000
Where have you hidden it?

01:44:37.166 --> 01:44:38.375
You’ve sent me a letter?

01:44:39.916 --> 01:44:42.333
Okay, I’ll let you know… Okay.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.541
Hello,
Harinath. This is Somnath.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.250
Did Gobindo Ram
install the lock?

01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:59.458
That’s a relief!

01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:05.750
Harinath,
I’ve sent you a letter…

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.958
You’ll find the map there.

01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:11.500
Please put in the locker.

01:45:11.708 --> 01:45:13.375
I tried to contact the museum

01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:16.250
But they are tracking that too.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:22.791
Harinath,you’ll also find the text to be
etched On the Thanthania Kali Temple slab.

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.250
Please make sure it gets done.

01:45:27.208 --> 01:45:28.541
Thank you so much.

01:45:29.166 --> 01:45:32.083
What? Listen to me…
Listen to me carefully.

01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:36.250
I’ve hidden it with great
difficulty from them.

01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:41.208
One more thing… Hold on…

01:45:47.416 --> 01:45:56.708
I’ve sent my trustworthy
friends and seniors Some riddles.

01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:06.625
If ever a deserving person can
solve them he will reach the library.

01:46:07.333 --> 01:46:10.208
And he’ll deserve
the prize in the end.

01:46:11.916 --> 01:46:14.916
Write down the
numbers to unlock.

01:46:15.833 --> 01:46:17.750
It’s okay, Asutosh.

01:46:18.333 --> 01:46:21.208
I’ll waive off your loan.

01:46:21.583 --> 01:46:24.958
But in return…

01:46:44.208 --> 01:46:44.958
Mir Jafar…

01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:45.916
Somnath, stop.

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:48.708
What are you doing?

01:46:49.125 --> 01:46:50.791
Tell them where the object is.

01:46:52.166 --> 01:46:55.541
Somnath,you’ll be set for
life With the money you’ll get.

01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:58.750
Somnath, please listen to
me. I’ve sent you a letter.

01:46:59.375 --> 01:47:01.583
Find it if you can.

01:47:06.375 --> 01:47:08.333
Don’t shoot.

01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:15.166
Yes,
I’ve made mistakes. Big mistakes…

01:47:18.416 --> 01:47:25.541
I lost everything to my careless
youth. I was neck deep in debt.

01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:29.750
Only Amirchand saved me then.

01:47:31.041 --> 01:47:36.416
And I’m still paying for my sins

01:47:39.166 --> 01:47:41.458
Somnath was my best friend.

01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.208
He lived in this very house.

01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:47.791
I did everything to
protect the family’s honour.

01:47:48.041 --> 01:47:48.916
I had no other option.

01:47:49.083 --> 01:47:51.375
Brishti should know.
Soham’s real identity.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.416
What’s Soham’s real identity?

01:48:47.541 --> 01:48:55.625
The day Soham moved in,
I had a feeling…

01:48:56.750 --> 01:49:02.458
Amirchand knew
about Somnath’s letter.

01:49:05.041 --> 01:49:06.666
Amirchand knew
about Somnath’s letter.

01:49:06.666 --> 01:49:08.500
No one could solve it.

01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:17.958
Then ,one day Amirchand showed
me a photo of you and Soham.

01:49:17.958 --> 01:49:24.333
Asutosh your daughter
has found a gem.

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:32.375
The information I have about
the boy Will shake you to the core

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:38.458
Congratulations!

01:49:38.666 --> 01:49:40.458
When Somnath passed away,

01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:44.500
His wife Kusum was pregnant.

01:49:47.041 --> 01:49:49.291
Kusum died at childbirth.

01:49:52.166 --> 01:49:53.375
She had a son.

01:49:54.541 --> 01:49:56.833
He was sent to the orphanage.

01:50:00.375 --> 01:50:02.791
And when you mentioned…

01:50:04.416 --> 01:50:06.541
Soham is an orphan…

01:50:08.416 --> 01:50:10.250
The way he looked…

01:50:13.708 --> 01:50:16.250
I called the orphanage…

01:50:16.958 --> 01:50:25.875
I found out he is the
one. Somnath’s son.

01:50:28.083 --> 01:50:30.000
And his knowledge in history.

01:50:33.083 --> 01:50:35.250
That’s the power of gene!

01:50:38.333 --> 01:50:42.750
And you began
your Arabian Nights.

01:51:08.791 --> 01:51:11.708
But Sakhhi Gopal,
what was all this for?

01:51:15.666 --> 01:51:22.125
It’s the sword of
Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah!

01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:24.625
Before the Battle of Plassey,

01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:29.750
The Nawab made a
treaty with the French.

01:51:32.875 --> 01:51:44.291
And as a symbol of the treaty,
the French Gifted the Nawab a sword.

01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:49.208
Don’t you understand
the historical importance?

01:51:49.833 --> 01:51:51.458
Oh no, no, no…

01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:54.791
The price is 35 crores.

01:51:55.833 --> 01:51:58.166
No, no, not negotiable.

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:04.958
Let’s speak tomorrow
And close the deal. Okay?

01:52:07.708 --> 01:52:12.958
Believe me,
I’ve been repenting all my life.

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.958
What else could I have done ?

01:52:16.291 --> 01:52:17.541
We would have lost everything.

01:52:17.541 --> 01:52:18.958
Would you be okay with that?

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:24.250
If would have been
difficult But not impossible.

01:52:24.833 --> 01:52:27.333
That would have been
more respectful at least.

01:52:27.666 --> 01:52:30.833
Listen to me.
Please hear me out.

01:52:32.458 --> 01:52:38.583
Please don’t do this. Please
don’t misunderstand me.

01:52:38.583 --> 01:52:39.625
I’ve done everything for you.

01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:42.416
May be you should have
thought about it before.

01:53:20.416 --> 01:53:21.791
Mir Jafar.

01:53:22.333 --> 01:53:28.458
He was affected by
leprosy in his last days.

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:34.166
Time for you to suffer too.

01:53:42.291 --> 01:53:50.291
MIR JAFAR’S LEPROSY No
dishonesty will go unpunished.

01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:58.250
Everyone will pay
for their sins. You?

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:21.625
Time is a difficult riddle

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.666
Doubt digs deeper in the viens

01:54:26.666 --> 01:54:29.791
Hide and seek plays the clues

01:54:30.041 --> 01:54:33.708
History veiled in rhymes

01:54:42.916 --> 01:54:45.958
Time is a difficult riddle

01:54:46.125 --> 01:54:50.250
Doubt digs deeper in the viens

01:54:51.208 --> 01:54:54.041
Hide and seek plays the clues

01:54:54.333 --> 01:54:58.541
History veiled in rhymes

01:54:59.208 --> 01:55:06.333
Questions crowd the mind On a dark,
silent night

01:55:07.375 --> 01:55:13.916
What are they pointing at ?

01:55:14.083 --> 01:55:21.208
He’s looking for answers
hidden in the rhymes

01:55:21.666 --> 01:55:30.708
He’s looking for answers
hidden in the mysteries

01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.458
Tell me about Alinagar.

01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:15.541
What happened?

01:56:19.041 --> 01:56:20.583
What is the history of Alinagar?

01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:24.125
In 1756,
when Siraj ud-Daulah attacked Kolkata…

01:56:24.833 --> 01:56:25.875
When he seized Kolkata…

01:56:26.416 --> 01:56:30.583
He changed Kolkata’s name to Alinagar
After his grandfather, Ali Wardi Khan.

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:38.333
Taking advantage of the similarity in name with Calicut,
The English would export cotton and silk from Kolkata.

01:56:39.166 --> 01:56:41.291
Siraj wanted to
destroy that business.

01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:47.583
They treaty between Lord Clive and
Mir Jafar During the Battle of Plassey…

01:56:48.875 --> 01:56:54.125
Clearly states that the name Of the
city had to be changed back to Kolkata.

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:58.333
So Alinagar’s founder
is Siraj ud-Daulah.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:00.875
-Do you remember the riddle?

01:57:01.541 --> 01:57:03.416
-My memory is my only strength.

01:57:08.208 --> 01:57:11.166
“The last remains of
Alinagar’s founder here lies…”

01:57:11.541 --> 01:57:13.000
That means Siraj
ud-Daulah’s grave.

01:57:13.833 --> 01:57:15.541
Murshidabad’s Khushbagh.

01:57:25.833 --> 01:57:28.208
“The last remains of
Alinagar’s founder here lies…”

01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:32.291
“Count the number
of grave lengthwise.”

01:57:32.666 --> 01:57:35.625
So, we have to count
The total number of graves.

01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:38.416
Bengal’s last independent Nawab.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.250
Let’s go… Hurry up.

01:57:42.166 --> 01:57:43.750
Come on…

01:57:45.041 --> 01:57:48.791
One, two, three,
three, four, five…

01:57:49.333 --> 01:57:51.416
Keep counting… Six, seven…

01:57:51.416 --> 01:57:52.250
Come here.

01:58:30.125 --> 01:58:31.083
I counted 17 graves that side.

01:58:31.291 --> 01:58:32.791
-How many were there inside?
-Eight.

01:58:33.166 --> 01:58:33.791
This side had nine.

01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:35.458
That adds up to 34.

01:58:35.458 --> 01:58:35.875
What next?

01:58:36.083 --> 01:58:40.250
“Now it’s time to cross the river “You’ll
reach the town’s north-east corner.”

01:58:40.958 --> 01:58:41.666
Let’s go…

01:58:43.833 --> 01:58:47.541
Across the Ganges is
the city’s north-east corner.

01:58:48.416 --> 01:58:49.500
Katra Mosque.

01:58:50.250 --> 01:58:52.625
“Covered in dust,
the founding father Sleeps under the stair

01:58:52.875 --> 01:58:56.708
In 1704 AD. Murshid Quli Khan Came to
Bengal as Aurangazeb’s Prime Minister.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.916
And he named the town
after himself. Murshidabad.

01:59:02.125 --> 01:59:05.416
Murshid Quli Khan’s grave is located
Under the stairs of the Katra Mosque.

01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:13.333
He wanted the dust from the foot Of
every pilgrim who visited the mosque.

01:59:49.125 --> 01:59:52.333
“Covered in dust, the founding
father Sleeps under the stair.”

01:59:53.666 --> 01:59:55.958
“Unique design of the
door You’ll find here.”

02:00:03.416 --> 02:00:04.833
Where will we find
it in this huge place ?

02:00:06.833 --> 02:00:07.750
Come this way…

02:00:27.958 --> 02:00:30.000
There’s a unique design
here That is not repeated.

02:00:31.625 --> 02:00:32.750
You won’t find the
design for the second time.

02:00:34.041 --> 02:00:35.000
Let’s start looking.

02:01:00.708 --> 02:01:01.208
Soham!

02:01:04.208 --> 02:01:07.416
Only this design is one of it’s
kind. Did you find anything that side?

02:01:07.708 --> 02:01:09.291
I’ve checked. It’s not there.

02:01:09.291 --> 02:01:09.916
Give me your phone .

02:01:16.875 --> 02:01:19.333
The west… This way… Let’s go.

02:01:36.541 --> 02:01:39.083
“The unique door on the west Will
lead you to a secret passageway.”

02:01:40.333 --> 02:01:41.833
It’s this way…

02:01:56.250 --> 02:01:57.666
Brishti, show me the photo.

02:02:08.916 --> 02:02:09.500
Come…

02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:27.916
“Move past the number of rooms
You’d counted earlier in the day.”

02:02:29.708 --> 02:02:32.708
The total number of
graves were 34. Yes.

02:02:32.916 --> 02:02:34.125
We’ve to cross 34 rooms.

02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:35.583
So,
he’s talking about this room.

02:02:35.708 --> 02:02:36.708
Yes, should be.

02:02:36.833 --> 02:02:38.083
-One, two… -Two…

02:02:39.833 --> 02:02:41.333
-Three, four… -Three…

02:02:44.958 --> 02:02:49.625
Five,six,seven.eight,
Nine,ten,eleven…

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:56.666
The dark dawn unknowingly

02:02:57.208 --> 02:03:01.208
Invites the nocturnals

02:03:02.166 --> 02:03:12.625
The hunter is consumed by
the hunt Crime doesn’t pay.

02:03:13.125 --> 02:03:17.333
The criminal will be punished

02:03:17.333 --> 02:03:21.583
Anger and courage

02:03:21.583 --> 02:03:25.791
Will break the labyrinth

02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:42.000
The darkness will be shattered Fear is pulsating
through the veins Looking for a way out.

02:03:42.333 --> 02:03:58.625
The darkness will be shattered Fear is pulsating
through the veins Looking for a way out.

02:03:58.875 --> 02:04:05.958
The hints are hiding,
The proof is injured

02:04:06.166 --> 02:04:13.625
The morning will bring an
end to this war With the truth.

02:04:15.166 --> 02:04:22.208
The hints are hiding,
The proof is injured

02:04:22.666 --> 02:04:30.125
The morning will bring an
end to this war With the truth.

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:45.791
Amirchand, don’t touch it.

02:04:46.375 --> 02:04:48.750
Where did these
people come from?

02:04:49.791 --> 02:04:52.458
-It’s good in a way. Thank you very much.
-Amirchand…

02:04:53.583 --> 02:05:00.208
My father had worked very hard to
acquire it. You can’t just take it away.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So,
now you know who your father is ?

02:05:03.541 --> 02:05:05.416
Let me send you to your father.

02:05:05.666 --> 02:05:09.000
Asutosh’s daughter
can go along with you.

02:05:09.375 --> 02:05:11.125
This is God’s grace!

02:05:11.375 --> 02:05:13.916
When you overheard
me in the library…

02:05:14.708 --> 02:05:16.791
I don’t think you noticed
The last two lines of the poem.

02:05:17.958 --> 02:05:20.250
“Buried deep rests
Alinagar’s wealth

02:05:21.583 --> 02:05:24.875
“Careful, touching it will
be injurious to your health.”

02:05:24.875 --> 02:05:29.083
Please tell your Bengali
brothers These poems, okay?

02:05:29.875 --> 02:05:32.500
I only care about
the precious object.

02:05:34.458 --> 02:05:35.833
-Amirchand,please listen to me…

02:05:35.916 --> 02:05:37.833
-Come to me, precious…

02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:40.583
Everything my father
has said has come true.

02:05:41.875 --> 02:05:42.666
This will come true too…

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.333
I’m warning you
for the last time.

02:05:47.083 --> 02:05:47.958
Do not touch it!

02:05:48.125 --> 02:05:54.708
Watch me do it… Don’t touch it…

02:05:59.958 --> 02:06:01.583
Please don’t do it…

02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.750
This is the Katra Mosque.

02:06:21.208 --> 02:06:23.125
This is where the underground
high tension cable runs through.

02:06:24.250 --> 02:06:25.791
Repairing this is
creating a lot of trouble.

02:06:27.041 --> 02:06:28.958
We’ll cut all power supply For
the next three days to repair it.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.625
Lots of wires go
through here also…

02:06:33.583 --> 02:06:34.583
What is the matter?

02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:48.416
“Buried deep rests Alinagar’s wealth “Careful,
touching it will be injurious to your health.”

02:06:59.458 --> 02:07:02.916
I’m Barnali Sen. CID

02:07:03.208 --> 02:07:05.750
I’m the investigating officer
For the 1990 murder case.

02:07:06.125 --> 02:07:08.291
My work is done for now.

02:07:11.458 --> 02:07:13.958
I wanted to show you
a photo Before I left.

02:07:14.208 --> 02:07:15.458
Do you recognize this man ?

02:07:23.916 --> 02:07:25.458
-This is…
- My father and that’s me…

02:07:27.833 --> 02:07:29.000
Bye.

02:08:17.833 --> 02:08:22.041
Can I have a minute?

02:08:26.041 --> 02:08:34.833
I have no qualms in accepting…
I had Somnath’s manuscript.

02:08:37.166 --> 02:08:42.875
I had taken
advantage of his death.

02:08:48.791 --> 02:08:54.541
This book… …is a result
of Somnath’s hard work.

02:08:58.125 --> 02:09:01.458
The name of the author of “Bengal’s
Mirror” Will change from the next edition.

02:09:08.333 --> 02:09:10.250
I’ve heard plending guilty…

02:09:13.083 --> 02:09:14.416
Lowers the guilt.

02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:17.541
Don’t know.

02:09:20.166 --> 02:09:21.916
But whatever you go…

02:09:25.083 --> 02:09:30.000
…if you could take
her along… Will you?

02:09:32.666 --> 02:09:34.208
Then I won’t be worried…

02:09:58.541 --> 02:10:03.250
