00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:35.312
Hello?

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:37.112
Janavarta News Paper! (People's Herald)

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:37.752
Yes.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.112
Am I talking to the Editor?

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:41.232
Yes.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:44.432
Haridas, Ashok Gupta here!

00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:45.792
Yes Sir?

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:49.352
I'm calling you with some news

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:50.592
What news?

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:55.392
There've been some
Jaundice cases here in Chandipur!

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:56.232
Jaundice?

00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.912
Yes, what we call Infective Hepatitis!

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.272
Also other water
borne diseases as well...

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:07.032
...like typhoid,
gastroenteritis and others!

00:01:07.352 --> 00:01:11.272
They've occurred in our
hospital and in private ones!

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:13.592
None of them have ever
been seen in Chandipur!

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:20.072
Please print this so that
people can be made aware

00:01:20.552 --> 00:01:22.232
Know how it is happening?

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:25.112
No, not yet !

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:29.112
We can't find the source
of the contamination !

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:33.032
Should I tell you what I think
- Yes, do!

00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:36.832
The Santoshpur chemical
factory across the river...

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.872
...could be leaving chemical
impurities in the water...

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.672
...because we know the fish are dying!

00:01:42.952 --> 00:01:45.712
We've printed that too!
Haven't you read it?

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:50.232
No, chemical impurities
don't cause such diseases

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:52.432
I'm sure you know better!

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.992
Will you print it?

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:58.312
Should we say Infective
Hepatitis or Jaundice?

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:01.792
Jaundice is better understood!

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:07.752
All right, I'm sending you a reporter
- Sanat Dasgupta

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:09.912
Please give him more details

00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:14.152
All right
- I'll keep you informed

00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:15.112
Thank you, sir.

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:28.592

Home made , I presume?

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:30.472
Yes. Like it?
- Delicious!

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:34.752
In the office I just have tea.
I'm having this out of greed!

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:38.232
I was wondering how
you found time to come

00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:42.312
I thought newspaper
editors worked till midnight!

00:04:42.392 --> 00:04:43.512
True,

00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:47.592
...but as I said I had to
meet the doctor urgently on work

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:49.792
He's normally here by now...

00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:54.352
There seems to be an
epidemic about, though

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:55.872
What epidemic?

00:04:56.152 --> 00:04:59.032
Jaundice!
- Again?

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.312
So it seems

00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:04.232
We'd written about a
few cases in Janavarta.

00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:06.192
The doctor himself told us about them!

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.432
It's never happened here before!

00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:11.512
He's been worried the past few days

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:13.872
There've been quite a few cases...

00:05:13.952 --> 00:05:16.032
...in his private practice as well!

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:19.472
I hope it'll end!

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.512
After Bhargava's temple has come up...

00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:24.992
...these last 10 years
have been so different!

00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:27.632
It's still 2 months to Shivratri...

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:30.392
...yet all hotels are booked fully!

00:05:31.152 --> 00:05:32.992
Chandipur is an important place now!

00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:35.192
We love this place!

00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:38.912
We've been born and brought up here!

00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:41.592
Chandan!

00:05:43.752 --> 00:05:45.792
Of course he studied
medicine in Calcutta

00:05:46.592 --> 00:05:48.072
After our marriage,

00:05:48.152 --> 00:05:51.032
we stayed there a
while as he was practicing

00:05:51.472 --> 00:05:52.912
I didn't like it

00:05:53.432 --> 00:05:55.552
I felt at peace again when
he returned to Chandipur!

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.952
We prefer small towns

00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:02.232
Compared to Calcutta's pollu...

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:05.232
Where did the sun rise today?

00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:07.712
Never find the time, too busy

00:06:08.432 --> 00:06:11.032
The editor of Janavarta,
Haridas Bagchi...

00:06:11.232 --> 00:06:12.552
and my brother-in-law

00:06:12.632 --> 00:06:14.232
Of course,

00:06:14.472 --> 00:06:16.872
...don't I know the
Chairman of the Municipality?

00:06:16.992 --> 00:06:21.072
Hasn't he returned yet?
- Maybe with a patient!

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:25.112
Will you have tea?
- No, I've just had some

00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:28.472
It's home made
- Not between meals!

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:31.712
Still having trouble
with your digestion ?

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.152
Ashok's prescription didn't work...

00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:36.632
...so I've turned to herbal medicine.

00:06:36.672 --> 00:06:39.512
Won't you have anything?
- Just a glass of water

00:06:39.552 --> 00:06:40.512
Okay.

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.672
How's your paper doing?

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:46.512
Still running!

00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:50.192
You seem to have moved a
bit to the left lately

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:52.272
Has it improved the circulation?

00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:54.152
Do you read it?

00:06:54.752 --> 00:06:57.832
At times, its the
only daily in Chandipur

00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.112
That is why I do go over it sometimes.

00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:05.112
Hadn't your paper first
reported about jaundice?

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:07.312
Thanks to the doctor!

00:07:07.912 --> 00:07:09.192
Surprising!

00:07:09.832 --> 00:07:11.952
He didn't say anything to me!

00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:14.552
Maybe he didn't find the time.

00:07:14.632 --> 00:07:17.912
You know how absent minded he is!

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:20.272
What does he think about it?

00:07:20.872 --> 00:07:22.352
Not much...

00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:24.232
...but he's quite worried!

00:07:24.592 --> 00:07:25.952
Even if it's jaundice...

00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:29.552
...it won't stop people
coming for the festival!

00:07:30.552 --> 00:07:32.352
Even since the
Tripureshwar temples's been built...

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:34.032
...they've increase 3 fold!

00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:37.312
I needn't tell you.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.872
You're the President
of the Bhavgava Trust!

00:07:40.072 --> 00:07:41.792
Have you ever been to the temple?

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:45.832
Indeed, both of us have been there

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:50.312
I'm not like Ashok,
I believe in religion

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:53.992
A week of praying at the
temple and my spondilitis was cured!

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:57.592
Really?
- They say Shiva is Very powerful

00:07:59.872 --> 00:08:01.352
That must be my husband

00:08:02.592 --> 00:08:05.272
I hope so. I've some work with him

00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:08.272
I have to go soon!

00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:10.312
What news of your son?

00:08:11.152 --> 00:08:13.592
He decided to stay back

00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:15.312
In America?

00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:17.192
So it seems

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:22.032
Oh, Nishit? What brings you here?

00:08:22.112 --> 00:08:23.872
Sit, I'll tell you

00:08:24.632 --> 00:08:27.712
Saw Ronen coming on foot,
so I gave him a lift!

00:08:27.792 --> 00:08:28.632
Have a seat, Ronen.

00:08:29.232 --> 00:08:30.992
They've all been waiting for you

00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:34.352
I got delayed by a patient

00:08:34.432 --> 00:08:35.552
The same case of jaundice?

00:08:36.512 --> 00:08:39.992
Yes, he's out of danger now.
What news of the hospital?

00:08:40.192 --> 00:08:41.992
That's what I came to hear

00:08:42.112 --> 00:08:44.752
There's nothing wrong there,

00:08:44.832 --> 00:08:47.392
just an increase of
these jaundice cases!

00:08:47.832 --> 00:08:49.312
Bhargava wanted to know...

00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:51.912
...if you had
adequate stocks of medicine?

00:08:51.992 --> 00:08:53.752
No worry there!

00:08:54.192 --> 00:08:58.512
What worries me is the cause
of this water contamination!

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:02.512
Is it from any particular area?

00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:08.432
I think so, but it
requires investigation

00:09:10.352 --> 00:09:12.192
Some tea, Ronen?

00:09:12.632 --> 00:09:13.312
I don't mind

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:15.272
Ranu isn't back yet

00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:17.032
That's all right, I'll wait

00:09:18.952 --> 00:09:19.952
By the way...

00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:22.352
...any letters for me?

00:09:22.872 --> 00:09:23.752
None!

00:09:28.072 --> 00:09:31.512
Let me know if you need anything

00:09:31.992 --> 00:09:34.192
That won't be necessary

00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:37.832
Bhargava has done a great
service by building the hospital...

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:39.672
Chandipur has all the facilities now

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:42.592
I think among small towns... none can...

00:09:42.992 --> 00:09:44.752
...compare with Chandipur

00:09:45.832 --> 00:09:48.512
I agree with you.

00:09:49.112 --> 00:09:51.152
Even culturally we
are not lagging behind!

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:54.032
Look at Ronen, he's from here!

00:09:54.392 --> 00:09:56.232
See what he's achieved!

00:09:57.032 --> 00:09:59.072
We're doing what we can

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:01.592
We've formed a Theater group.

00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:04.032
The doctor's daughter also acts in it

00:10:04.712 --> 00:10:08.552
Brought out, a year ago, a
literary quarterly journal...

00:10:08.832 --> 00:10:11.792
Ronen works in a bank
He has a lucrative job

00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:13.032
That's good

00:10:14.192 --> 00:10:15.792
What's your journal called?

00:10:16.592 --> 00:10:17.832
The Torch (Mashal)

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.032
Which way do you lean?

00:10:22.752 --> 00:10:23.392
Right?

00:10:24.312 --> 00:10:25.152
Or left?

00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:29.992
Today most journals
lean a bit to the left

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:34.232
But we have just begun.
We have a lot to overcome

00:10:35.392 --> 00:10:36.512
Few Subscribers

00:10:37.672 --> 00:10:39.152
It's the effort that matters

00:10:41.192 --> 00:10:43.752
You've said everything
but the important thing!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.832
I leave that to you -What is it?

00:10:47.592 --> 00:10:50.192
He's our future son-in-law! -Is that so?

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:51.712
Really? Congratulations.

00:10:52.312 --> 00:10:53.032
Thanks.

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:55.392
When is the happy day?

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:57.192
This "May"!

00:10:58.312 --> 00:11:00.552
Is Ranu still teaching at school?

00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:04.712
Yes, but she needn't
any more from May...

00:11:05.392 --> 00:11:08.032
...because Ronen has
been promoted from January!

00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:10.312
Haridas, you've been sitting quiet!

00:11:10.872 --> 00:11:13.952
How're you getting along? -I'm
looking forward to your story?

00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:15.992
What about?

00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:17.752
About Chandipur!

00:11:18.752 --> 00:11:20.792
You'd written about its climate once

00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:23.032
Now write something else!

00:11:23.672 --> 00:11:27.552
This cultural scene...
it can be a good subject

00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:33.312
No... leave it for now

00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:34.472
Why not?

00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:38.392
It would be a very
good thing for Chandipur

00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:41.792
The news about jaundice
must have upset many people

00:11:42.512 --> 00:11:43.752
I've been upset too!

00:11:45.032 --> 00:11:46.192
Terribly upset

00:11:47.872 --> 00:11:49.392
I'm in no mood to write!

00:11:50.072 --> 00:11:55.232
But to refuse to write... aren't
you a well wisher of Chandipur?

00:11:55.672 --> 00:12:00.152
Of course, a hundred fold!
No one feels than I do!

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:04.912
That's fine! We're
trying to build Chandipur...

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:07.192
...into a major tourist
spot ...in West Bengal

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.552
We need your active support!

00:12:10.632 --> 00:12:12.432
As for these new viruses...

00:12:12.672 --> 00:12:16.472
...the municipality is
behind you, rest assured!

00:12:17.832 --> 00:12:20.512
Leaving? -Yes

00:12:21.432 --> 00:12:25.592
I'll come some other time!
-Don't forget!

00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:28.192
Ronen, send me a copy of your journal

00:12:28.272 --> 00:12:29.312
I will - Goodnight.

00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:30.232
Goodnight.

00:12:32.912 --> 00:12:36.472
The Chairman appeared in an affable mood

00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.472
His mood is off...

00:12:43.352 --> 00:12:45.272
...when he has indigestion!

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:48.312
I thought he'd be upset at meeting me!

00:12:48.632 --> 00:12:50.712
Heard what he asked about my journal?

00:12:51.072 --> 00:12:52.712
Don't take that seriously

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:56.712
No, I was in a fix
didn't know what to say

00:12:57.192 --> 00:12:59.232
Nishit has always been conservative

00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:02.232
We never agree on anything

00:13:03.392 --> 00:13:07.672
But we have some good points
efficiency is worth praising

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:10.552
Been Chairman of
Municipality 3 times running

00:13:10.992 --> 00:13:12.512
The idea of the temple...

00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:15.072
...is his Bhargava only
conceived of the hospital

00:13:15.192 --> 00:13:18.112
But for so many
people visiting Chandipur

00:13:18.192 --> 00:13:20.832
...he alone is responsible

00:13:21.552 --> 00:13:24.272
It's now an obsession with him

00:13:24.672 --> 00:13:28.032
He's a partner in
Bhargava's rice mill, is he?

00:13:28.832 --> 00:13:30.672
Yes, rice mill. Cold storage.

00:13:31.272 --> 00:13:32.472
He is pretty well off.

00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:36.472
You're gossiping here...

00:13:37.152 --> 00:13:38.552
While I work to death!

00:13:39.032 --> 00:13:40.392
Why so late?

00:13:41.232 --> 00:13:42.192
Meeting.

00:13:43.032 --> 00:13:44.152
Some tea?

00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:46.672
Yes, I will

00:13:47.232 --> 00:13:48.792
Seeing your mood...

00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:51.152
...may I ask you a
question without fear?

00:13:51.672 --> 00:13:54.432
Don't be dramatic! What question?

00:13:55.192 --> 00:13:56.912
Is your notebook in the bag?

00:13:57.352 --> 00:13:58.272
Yes

00:13:59.032 --> 00:14:00.792
But it's better you don't see it today

00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:03.352
If you have any proofs, give them to me,

00:14:03.432 --> 00:14:04.312
I'll correct them.

00:14:04.992 --> 00:14:05.712
Thanks.

00:14:08.872 --> 00:14:10.512
A letter for you, father

00:14:11.672 --> 00:14:12.632
When did it come?

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:15.512
The postman brought it as
I was leaving for school

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:20.312
Excuse me while I read this

00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:23.912
What news of your school?

00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:27.512
It's only 5 months old -Like it?

00:14:28.272 --> 00:14:29.392
I do!

00:14:29.992 --> 00:14:33.272
Even more at the end of
the month when I get paid!

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.912
But I've no control over what I teach

00:14:38.632 --> 00:14:41.472
I don't believe half of what I teach

00:14:42.712 --> 00:14:46.392
But it's good in a way...
everyone loves me!

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.032
I am the youngest of the teachers.

00:14:49.032 --> 00:14:52.592
Has the story I gave you
to translate been done?

00:14:54.832 --> 00:14:56.472
I've had no time.

00:14:56.552 --> 00:14:58.312
I hope you're not in a hurry for it?

00:15:01.672 --> 00:15:03.352
Within the next week....

00:15:09.912 --> 00:15:11.152
Who's letter? Father!

00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:22.392
What is it?

00:15:28.592 --> 00:15:30.872
I thought as much

00:15:33.272 --> 00:15:34.792
I was right.

00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:37.912
Nishit....

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:41.592
...if he were here, he'd have known!

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:43.672
I am quite restless to know.

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:49.312
Listen... this isn't just a letter...

00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:53.232
I had sent a sample of
Chandipur's water...

00:15:53.312 --> 00:15:55.472
...to Calcutta for analysis

00:15:56.552 --> 00:15:57.872
Here it is report!

00:15:58.232 --> 00:15:59.232
Water from where?

00:16:00.072 --> 00:16:02.752
From the most crowded part of Chandipur!

00:16:03.352 --> 00:16:06.952
Bhuvanpulli! -Bhuvanpulli!

00:16:08.232 --> 00:16:13.912
This report says that the
water is full of bacteria!

00:16:15.032 --> 00:16:18.872
Most patients came from there,
so I sent sample from there....

00:16:19.152 --> 00:16:22.032
...now its proved that
whatever waterborne disease...

00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:24.192
...are found in Chandipur's...

00:16:24.232 --> 00:16:26.472
...the entire source is Bhuvanpulli!

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.712
That means?... -What?

00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:30.832
Bhuvanpulli has our temple

00:16:31.072 --> 00:16:32.232
Exactly.

00:16:32.872 --> 00:16:34.792
At the centre of Bhuvanpulli !

00:16:34.872 --> 00:16:36.792
Everyone is using that temple water

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:38.792
Not only that, they're drinking it!

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:39.792
Holy water!

00:16:39.872 --> 00:16:40.952
Holy water!

00:16:41.672 --> 00:16:45.552
That very infested water,

00:16:45.632 --> 00:16:48.632
which faithful are drinking....

00:16:49.032 --> 00:16:52.912
...from that very water,
poison is entering people!

00:16:53.872 --> 00:16:56.392
The question is...

00:16:56.472 --> 00:17:00.432
where daily a thousand
people drink the holy water...

00:17:01.232 --> 00:17:03.952
...why is not everyone being affected?

00:17:05.032 --> 00:17:08.112
Because there is a built
in resistance in the body.

00:17:08.712 --> 00:17:10.232
We call it immunity!

00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:12.152
This is what protects
everyone from getting ill!

00:17:12.192 --> 00:17:17.072
But if even one is affected by typhoid,
cholera or jaundice...

00:17:17.512 --> 00:17:19.872
...then that is dangerous!

00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:22.752
How did such a scandal
take place? -Very simple...

00:17:23.232 --> 00:17:26.592
The laying of underground
pipes must have been negligent!

00:17:27.072 --> 00:17:30.392
The water pipe must have cracked.
The drain too cracked!

00:17:30.472 --> 00:17:32.632
Now these waters are mixing

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:34.632
This is always happening in our country

00:17:35.232 --> 00:17:37.072
What will you do?

00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:43.312
I must send this report to
my brother, with my comments

00:17:44.472 --> 00:17:47.872
As municipal Chairman, he
must take action immediately

00:17:48.832 --> 00:17:51.512
And as long as the temple
water is not purified...

00:17:51.552 --> 00:17:54.752
...till then it cannot be used!

00:17:56.592 --> 00:17:58.072
I have found out that...

00:17:58.152 --> 00:18:00.192
...there's no natural
source of water nearby!

00:18:00.632 --> 00:18:04.432
Bhuvanpulli has a
small number of tube wells

00:18:05.592 --> 00:18:08.872
So apart from complete
repair of the system,

00:18:08.952 --> 00:18:11.312
...there's no way out!

00:18:11.912 --> 00:18:12.992
Doctor Gupta.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:18.712
Can we... print this... in the papers?

00:18:19.112 --> 00:18:20.472
Must you ask?

00:18:20.792 --> 00:18:22.312
Even about the temple?

00:18:22.632 --> 00:18:24.032
You doubt it?

00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:28.392
There'll be panic everywhere...

00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:33.512
Yes. That is true.

00:18:34.752 --> 00:18:35.992
Okay.

00:18:37.472 --> 00:18:39.992
Don't mention Bhuvanpulli's name

00:18:40.072 --> 00:18:44.152
Say a thickly
populated area of Chandipur.

00:18:44.672 --> 00:18:46.432
Lets see what my brother says,

00:18:46.512 --> 00:18:49.432
then it can be given the headlines!

00:18:49.752 --> 00:18:51.952
This is just to give people a warning

00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:55.872
This is an
extraordinary thing you've done!

00:18:56.192 --> 00:18:59.712
You'll see, soon
you'll be a national hero!

00:19:03.912 --> 00:19:05.592
No, Haridas...

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.752
I don't want to be hero!

00:19:08.312 --> 00:19:10.592
I want to be an ordinary citizen

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:14.432
Whatever I've done...

00:19:15.032 --> 00:19:17.912
...is my duty as a doctor!

00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:21.832
Hail Lord. Come and
give the offering here.

00:19:21.872 --> 00:19:22.952
I will perform the veneration here.

00:19:23.552 --> 00:19:25.632
Priest. Please take my offerings.

00:19:25.952 --> 00:19:28.032
Sir. Please repeat the chant after me.

00:19:28.992 --> 00:19:32.632
Don't break the queue. Walk in a queue.

00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:35.952
Where is the coconut seller?

00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:38.792
Give me some holy water.

00:19:39.232 --> 00:19:41.752
Hey, move ahead. Come on.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:44.952
Hey, don't keep
standing here. Come on. Move.

00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:47.432
It is taking a long
time for the veneration.

00:19:47.512 --> 00:19:50.472
Father, I cannot find mother anywhere.

00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:53.592
Priest. Please perform my veneration.

00:19:55.592 --> 00:19:56.512
There are so many
waiting for their turn.

00:19:59.712 --> 00:20:01.352
Hey, move ahead. Come on.

00:20:11.472 --> 00:20:12.192
Hey, don't keep
standing here. Come on. Move.

00:20:12.672 --> 00:20:13.472
Maya. - Coming.

00:20:15.152 --> 00:20:15.872
Coffee.

00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:21.072
Back so soon?

00:20:23.632 --> 00:20:25.112
Nishit's coming!

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.232
He's got my report

00:20:29.392 --> 00:20:30.752
Haridas had phoned

00:20:32.152 --> 00:20:33.872
He needs something

00:20:37.032 --> 00:20:38.312
Any more patients?

00:20:39.472 --> 00:20:40.952
Sushanta is dead!

00:20:43.472 --> 00:20:44.472
Dead?

00:20:46.192 --> 00:20:47.192
Yes

00:20:48.992 --> 00:20:50.552
At 6:30 am

00:20:50.912 --> 00:20:51.672
But actually..

00:20:52.472 --> 00:20:54.512
..he was very critical.

00:20:58.752 --> 00:21:01.232
The first person known to us, gone!

00:21:01.472 --> 00:21:02.472
More will go!

00:21:03.152 --> 00:21:05.112
If nothing is done at once!

00:21:06.552 --> 00:21:08.592
Surely Nishit will do something!

00:21:09.752 --> 00:21:13.552
The problem is... he is jealous!

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.592
If he had discovered it himself then...

00:21:21.272 --> 00:21:25.072
He is Adhir Mukherjee,
our printer and publisher

00:21:25.392 --> 00:21:28.992
Then you will be
responsible in the eyes of the law...

00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:31.072
...if anything
objectionable is published

00:21:31.352 --> 00:21:32.432
True!

00:21:32.872 --> 00:21:34.752
He wants a few words with you

00:21:35.072 --> 00:21:37.072
Have some tea or coffee

00:21:37.312 --> 00:21:39.272
Ho, we're only here a short while

00:21:40.792 --> 00:21:41.832
Do sit!

00:21:45.232 --> 00:21:49.432
You've seen the news?
-Yes, I think it will work

00:21:50.312 --> 00:21:51.312
What is it? Tell me!

00:21:51.392 --> 00:21:55.072
I didn't come to speak
about any objectionable news

00:21:55.952 --> 00:21:58.112
I've come to depend on
you for your advice...

00:21:58.552 --> 00:21:59.872
On what?

00:22:00.432 --> 00:22:01.032
Look.

00:22:01.832 --> 00:22:04.032
This discovery you've made...

00:22:04.912 --> 00:22:07.912
...has not pleased everyone, I'm sure

00:22:08.632 --> 00:22:10.872
To believe that Chandipur
is not a healthy place...

00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:12.672
...is not what everyone agrees on

00:22:13.152 --> 00:22:15.992
Many people have told
having seen the news...

00:22:16.312 --> 00:22:19.632
...doctor Gupta is mistaken.
The water here can't be polluted

00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:21.552
Is that so?

00:22:22.712 --> 00:22:24.312
Don't worry about it!

00:22:24.992 --> 00:22:28.032
I'm Chairman of three Housing Co-ops...

00:22:28.512 --> 00:22:30.952
...and over all the
members of these co-operatives...

00:22:31.192 --> 00:22:33.112
...I have sufficient influence...

00:22:34.232 --> 00:22:37.912
I can guarantee that
everyone will back you

00:22:38.152 --> 00:22:42.272
I think after this your
position will become strong!

00:22:42.352 --> 00:22:47.032
That's good, alone one can't do much...

00:22:47.912 --> 00:22:52.032
...though a lot depends on
what decision my brother takes

00:22:52.512 --> 00:22:55.632
I've told you that all
of us are behind you!

00:22:56.352 --> 00:22:59.392
If necessary, we'll call a
meeting and pass a resolution...

00:23:00.352 --> 00:23:04.832
But, I don't like crossing my limits...

00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:07.912
Going beyond is not practical!

00:23:08.192 --> 00:23:11.552
But you've done the
citizens a great favour!

00:23:11.992 --> 00:23:16.232
They should let you know
how grateful they are!

00:23:16.752 --> 00:23:18.952
I don't think anyone will object to that

00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:22.272
This isn't the time for a reception

00:23:22.752 --> 00:23:26.352
Let the danger be over,
then we can think about it

00:23:26.552 --> 00:23:29.032
Anyway, I've expressed my desires

00:23:29.112 --> 00:23:30.312
Many thanks!

00:23:30.512 --> 00:23:32.712
May we leave?

00:23:33.032 --> 00:23:35.912
Please go ahead, I'll be with you!

00:23:39.392 --> 00:23:42.032
Okay.

00:23:42.432 --> 00:23:43.992
Can you spare 5 minutes?

00:23:45.232 --> 00:23:47.792
Yes, that much only,
My brother is coming

00:23:48.352 --> 00:23:49.792
All right, I'll be brief!

00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:51.112
Tell me.

00:23:53.072 --> 00:23:55.432
In such a situation
that has been created...

00:23:56.032 --> 00:23:59.912
...what would you do in
a progressive newspaper?

00:24:00.752 --> 00:24:02.112
I think...

00:24:02.552 --> 00:24:05.312
...to warn the
citizens is the first duty...

00:24:05.392 --> 00:24:09.752
...and immediately force a
decision of the higher authorities!

00:24:10.192 --> 00:24:11.752
Who will decide?

00:24:12.832 --> 00:24:16.752
You'll say your brother as a
Municipal Chairman will...

00:24:17.232 --> 00:24:19.552
...but apart from your brother...

00:24:19.632 --> 00:24:21.352
...there are other
influential persons I know

00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:25.152
When the news of fish dying
in the river was published...

00:24:25.592 --> 00:24:28.032
...then they came to my
office and threatened me...

00:24:28.072 --> 00:24:31.112
...that they'll see me if
Chandipur gets a bad reputation

00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:32.992
Actually,

00:24:33.272 --> 00:24:34.952
...the prosperity of Chandipur...

00:24:35.032 --> 00:24:37.272
...is being used for their own purposes

00:24:38.192 --> 00:24:39.872
The Tripureshwar temple...

00:24:39.952 --> 00:24:41.912
...is the greatest
attraction to Chandipur

00:24:42.352 --> 00:24:44.992
The daily income is mind boggling!

00:24:45.552 --> 00:24:47.872
That some of it isn't
going into their pockets...

00:24:47.952 --> 00:24:49.392
...is hard to believe!

00:24:50.032 --> 00:24:52.192
I want to expose them

00:24:57.912 --> 00:25:01.312
As a newspaper editor...

00:25:02.672 --> 00:25:04.832
...you'll do what you have to!

00:25:05.792 --> 00:25:07.632
I know all these bureaucrats!

00:25:08.712 --> 00:25:13.272
But I have to think of my own problems

00:25:14.632 --> 00:25:18.312
I can't forget my duties as a doctor

00:25:18.752 --> 00:25:20.912
But if your brother doesn't side you?

00:25:21.792 --> 00:25:22.792
Brother, look at this..

00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:25.192
We must be ready for every eventuality

00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:32.072
I..

00:25:34.272 --> 00:25:36.552
The report I had sent...

00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:39.112
...are you ready to publish...

00:25:39.192 --> 00:25:42.432
...if I wrote it as an article?

00:25:42.672 --> 00:25:46.552
Of course! This a good suggestion

00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:49.512
Then even if Nishit doesn't side me...

00:25:49.592 --> 00:25:51.752
...I'll write it today itself

00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:54.912
Ranu will copy it, when she returns,
Her handwriting is good...

00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:58.152
...and tonight I'll
drop it at your office

00:25:58.392 --> 00:25:58.992
Very good.

00:25:59.232 --> 00:26:00.352
May I go?

00:26:00.552 --> 00:26:01.112
Yes.

00:26:01.952 --> 00:26:04.912
I don't think there's
anything to worry about

00:26:05.472 --> 00:26:06.112
Greetings.

00:26:19.632 --> 00:26:21.472
What are you doing in
the kitchen all the time?

00:26:21.552 --> 00:26:22.912
Not in the kitchen.

00:26:22.992 --> 00:26:24.952
I was showing the cook a new recipe

00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:27.112
Let it be. Sit here awhile!

00:26:28.552 --> 00:26:29.672
Sit, sit.

00:26:35.072 --> 00:26:37.152
What are you thinking of?

00:26:40.472 --> 00:26:44.272
After getting the report yesterday...

00:26:46.632 --> 00:26:48.312
I'm very disturbed

00:26:49.072 --> 00:26:53.232
I quite see that. Am I less worried?

00:26:54.152 --> 00:26:57.432
I know what pressure is on you!

00:26:58.072 --> 00:27:01.272
There's no end to your
labour and then this...

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:04.672
That's why a good
decision should be taken at once

00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:07.552
And if Nishit disagrees

00:27:09.392 --> 00:27:11.432
No, I can't believe it

00:27:12.032 --> 00:27:14.072
He's as fond of Chandipur

00:27:14.712 --> 00:27:16.792
Will he oppose me in these bad days?

00:27:19.192 --> 00:27:21.112
I'm thinking of his jealousy!

00:27:21.712 --> 00:27:23.792
I've seen him these thirty years!

00:27:25.232 --> 00:27:26.952
Don't forget,

00:27:27.032 --> 00:27:28.872
...he was the one who
got me this hospital job!

00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:31.192
He told us about this house

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:37.512
But only after securing himself!

00:27:38.072 --> 00:27:39.672
Not before!

00:27:42.592 --> 00:27:44.072
If he took your side,

00:27:44.152 --> 00:27:46.752
I would be very happy ... but ...

00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:49.832
But?

00:27:50.592 --> 00:27:52.552
He's not like you...

00:27:53.232 --> 00:27:54.752
...to think you're brothers...

00:27:56.952 --> 00:27:57.712
Hello.

00:27:58.432 --> 00:28:01.152
Hey, good morning, Mr. Bhargava.

00:28:01.392 --> 00:28:02.112
Good morning.

00:28:02.832 --> 00:28:06.032
You've met Mr. Bhargava
- Of course, will you've some tea?

00:28:06.272 --> 00:28:06.832
No, thanks.

00:28:07.512 --> 00:28:08.392
Nor will I

00:28:09.632 --> 00:28:10.352
Please come and sit.

00:28:10.912 --> 00:28:12.432
Can we go to your Chamber?

00:28:12.992 --> 00:28:15.472
Of course, come.

00:28:20.792 --> 00:28:23.272
Come with me.

00:28:29.672 --> 00:28:31.312
Well, Mr. Bhargava?

00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:38.592
What have you done?

00:28:39.192 --> 00:28:40.112
Why?

00:28:40.832 --> 00:28:44.352
I've seen that report with Nishit

00:28:45.752 --> 00:28:47.792
My mind's a whirl! My head is spinning

00:28:48.592 --> 00:28:52.992
When I got the lab report,
I felt the same!

00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.792
It's a serious matter

00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:57.312
But why drag my temple into it?

00:28:57.832 --> 00:29:00.792
It's right in the heart of Bhuvanpulli

00:29:01.192 --> 00:29:03.672
The water there has been
found to be contaminated

00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:05.432
The temple water is the same.

00:29:05.472 --> 00:29:08.152
People are drinking that infected water!

00:29:14.392 --> 00:29:16.792
What's this? Do you know?

00:29:19.072 --> 00:29:21.112
This is holy water.

00:29:21.872 --> 00:29:23.072
Holy water.

00:29:23.152 --> 00:29:25.112
From my own temple.

00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.512
I give this to you

00:29:31.232 --> 00:29:32.712
Test it!

00:29:32.912 --> 00:29:36.512
If you can find one
germ of bacteria in it...

00:29:37.632 --> 00:29:39.592
I'll be deemed.

00:29:40.232 --> 00:29:41.712
What are you saying

00:29:45.592 --> 00:29:49.872
Your medical science won't
understand its properties

00:29:50.112 --> 00:29:51.352
Dr. Gupta.

00:29:54.552 --> 00:29:55.952
This holy water and all forms of
holy water are free from germs.

00:29:56.512 --> 00:29:58.432
This..

00:29:58.992 --> 00:30:02.152
This is rather strange!

00:30:11.112 --> 00:30:12.592
No, sir.

00:30:12.672 --> 00:30:15.552
It isn't strange at all.

00:30:16.712 --> 00:30:21.112
It's not only tap water,
but Ganges water too!

00:30:21.872 --> 00:30:23.712
How else can it be worshipped?

00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:28.872
We get a regular supply of
Ganges water from Calcutta.

00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:31.672
Then there is milk in it.

00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:33.912
There is the holy leaf.

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:35.552
There is sesame.

00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.912
And most important..

00:30:38.472 --> 00:30:41.472
..there are basil leaves.

00:30:46.472 --> 00:30:47.592
Do you know?

00:30:48.592 --> 00:30:51.552
All impurities are
removed by the Tulsi leaf!

00:30:55.432 --> 00:30:57.512
How can you know?

00:30:58.712 --> 00:31:01.672
But Hindus has known it
for thousands of years.

00:31:03.552 --> 00:31:06.992
After eating the `Prasad' a
patient fell ill and came to me

00:31:07.072 --> 00:31:08.712
But not holy water.

00:31:12.152 --> 00:31:13.512
Your brother told you to,

00:31:13.592 --> 00:31:17.032
but you didn't ever go to my temple

00:31:17.552 --> 00:31:20.192
In these last ten years.

00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:24.872
You won't understand the Hindu religion

00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:29.352
Then you won't do
anything about the water?

00:31:29.432 --> 00:31:31.592
There's nothing to be
done about the temple

00:31:31.792 --> 00:31:33.232
There is no necessity.

00:31:35.312 --> 00:31:37.312
Then I have nothing to say

00:31:38.552 --> 00:31:40.592
The number of patients are increasing

00:31:40.752 --> 00:31:43.112
Forget about the temple

00:31:44.112 --> 00:31:46.192
The municipality will censure that...

00:31:46.272 --> 00:31:47.832
the people of
Bhuvanpulli boil their water

00:31:48.472 --> 00:31:50.792
If necessary, more
tube wells will be dug

00:31:51.352 --> 00:31:54.832
But you will not give
my temple a bad name

00:31:55.512 --> 00:31:58.952
This is my request.

00:32:00.032 --> 00:32:03.072
Are you going?
- Yes, I have another appointment

00:32:03.152 --> 00:32:04.072
I have to go.

00:32:04.432 --> 00:32:07.272
I'll see you off!

00:32:17.912 --> 00:32:19.032
Listen Nishit

00:32:20.432 --> 00:32:26.552
I can see that your decision
won't differ from Bhargava's

00:32:28.272 --> 00:32:29.512
I have a question

00:32:29.872 --> 00:32:30.512
Well?

00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:34.792
Couldn't you have
discussed this business with me?

00:32:34.872 --> 00:32:36.992
But everything needs proof!

00:32:37.072 --> 00:32:40.592
I couldn't work on presumption
When I got proof, I told you

00:32:41.632 --> 00:32:44.472
Do you want to present this
report to the temple authorities?

00:32:44.552 --> 00:32:45.392
Immediately.

00:32:46.072 --> 00:32:48.872
Officially to the municipality as well

00:32:49.152 --> 00:32:50.472
The number of patients is increasing

00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:54.032
Bhargava may not want his
temple to have a bad name...

00:32:54.112 --> 00:32:57.232
...but I can't deny the lab report!

00:32:57.832 --> 00:32:59.072
If we agree...

00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:02.032
...that the underground pipe water...

00:33:02.792 --> 00:33:04.632
...is contaminated by drain water

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:08.232
Have you any idea how much time...

00:33:08.312 --> 00:33:11.432
...and money will be
needed to locate and repair it?

00:33:11.952 --> 00:33:14.112
And the temple must be closed

00:33:14.672 --> 00:33:17.952
Thousands of people
will know why its closed!

00:33:17.992 --> 00:33:20.272
Is there any other choice?

00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:23.592
If I say what Bhargava says...

00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:27.232
...that because of Tulsi
leaf etc. in holy water...

00:33:27.552 --> 00:33:29.152
... there can be no contamination...

00:33:29.232 --> 00:33:31.192
...and its been
happening this way for ages

00:33:31.752 --> 00:33:34.832
I'm concerned about the well
water of Tripureshwar temple...

00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:36.552
It is polluted

00:33:37.472 --> 00:33:39.632
Diseases are spreading here
which were never seen before

00:33:39.712 --> 00:33:41.272
Many have died...

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:44.952
...among those who are ill,
are residence of Bevampulli...

00:33:45.032 --> 00:33:47.112
...or visitor to the temple

00:33:48.072 --> 00:33:50.032
I accept everything

00:33:50.232 --> 00:33:51.552
But I still insist...

00:33:51.632 --> 00:33:53.792
...you don't submit this
report to the Committee

00:33:54.472 --> 00:33:56.312
I can keep quiet myself...

00:33:56.912 --> 00:33:58.512
Bhargava won't tell anyone...

00:33:58.872 --> 00:33:59.792
I know that for sure.

00:34:00.232 --> 00:34:02.312
But everyone cannot suppress this matter

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.352
And if this is now known,

00:34:04.432 --> 00:34:06.912
people will stop coming to Chandipur!

00:34:07.192 --> 00:34:08.512
That's what they'll do if
there's an epidemic also!

00:34:08.712 --> 00:34:10.112
I'll look into that

00:34:10.432 --> 00:34:14.032
Whether to boil water...
or dig more tube wells...

00:34:14.192 --> 00:34:15.352
I'll look into that.

00:34:15.432 --> 00:34:17.392
But to say the temple
water causes illness...

00:34:17.512 --> 00:34:18.952
...don't spread this rumour!

00:34:19.032 --> 00:34:22.912
But some people are thinking about it!

00:34:24.072 --> 00:34:24.912
How ?

00:34:26.192 --> 00:34:27.752
Haven't you seen Janavarta?

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:28.672
No.

00:34:38.392 --> 00:34:42.072
Chandipur endangered?

00:35:09.112 --> 00:35:10.512
When you did this...

00:35:12.432 --> 00:35:17.272
...didn't you think of yourself,
your family?

00:35:17.992 --> 00:35:19.552
What are you trying to say?

00:35:25.432 --> 00:35:28.552
Who got you the hospital job?

00:35:30.552 --> 00:35:31.632
You did!

00:35:33.112 --> 00:35:35.232
And I'm very grateful to you for that!

00:35:37.992 --> 00:35:39.872
I thought by settling you...

00:35:40.752 --> 00:35:42.952
... your ego would be satisfied...

00:35:44.592 --> 00:35:46.752
You'll be more careful

00:35:47.032 --> 00:35:48.552
Aren't I careful?

00:35:48.632 --> 00:35:51.832
As soon as you get a
new idea, you publish it!

00:35:52.632 --> 00:35:54.672
The last time. No park for children...

00:35:54.872 --> 00:35:56.552
You complained and published it

00:35:56.632 --> 00:35:59.832
When the land had already been
acquired by the Bhargava trust

00:36:00.472 --> 00:36:02.352
I didn't know that!

00:36:02.432 --> 00:36:04.272
If you'd asked me, you'd have known!

00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:06.192
Again you should have told me...

00:36:06.272 --> 00:36:08.152
...as soon as you
sent the chemical report

00:36:08.952 --> 00:36:10.392
But instead you wrote to the press

00:36:10.912 --> 00:36:13.352
But... what if people know?

00:36:13.432 --> 00:36:15.312
You've made a great mistake...

00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:17.952
... by involving the temple in it!

00:36:18.192 --> 00:36:20.072
The temple isn't mentioned in the paper,

00:36:20.632 --> 00:36:22.192
...nor in Bhuvanpulli's name!

00:36:22.352 --> 00:36:24.072
The people aren't fools!

00:36:24.152 --> 00:36:26.152
Even a stall owner knows...

00:36:26.512 --> 00:36:29.712
...that Bhuvanpulli is
the most crowded area

00:36:34.312 --> 00:36:35.912
Now it's your duty...

00:36:36.512 --> 00:36:38.832
...to contradict what you say...

00:36:39.872 --> 00:36:40.952
Or else

00:36:41.152 --> 00:36:43.512
...write to the
press that you were wrong

00:36:44.552 --> 00:36:46.432
That its not as serious matter...

00:36:47.312 --> 00:36:48.392
...as you had thought before!

00:36:49.192 --> 00:36:51.552
But I cannot lie

00:36:54.672 --> 00:36:55.872
Then ...

00:36:56.032 --> 00:36:58.112
... as municipal Chairman...

00:36:58.552 --> 00:37:00.232
...I must tell them!

00:37:02.312 --> 00:37:04.472
I will definitely protest about it!

00:37:04.992 --> 00:37:08.032
The greatest attraction
to Chandipur is its temple

00:37:08.632 --> 00:37:10.552
And the temple was my idea.

00:37:12.192 --> 00:37:15.112
I won't hear any scandal about it!

00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:20.392
Think over what I said

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:23.872
You should be seriously affected

00:37:25.072 --> 00:37:26.312
I don't want that either

00:37:27.512 --> 00:37:29.632
You're forgetting one thing...

00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:30.712
What?

00:37:31.472 --> 00:37:33.552
There's something called a court!

00:37:34.392 --> 00:37:35.832
If you tie me down,

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.072
...I'm bound to take
shelter under the law!

00:37:39.232 --> 00:37:41.952
Do you know Doctor Nandi?

00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:45.432
No, but his bother is my patient

00:37:46.552 --> 00:37:48.152
Then you ought to know...

00:37:48.592 --> 00:37:51.752
... that the doctor who goes
twice a week to the temple...

00:37:52.832 --> 00:37:56.192
...he will tear up the
petition of one so irreligious as you!

00:37:57.712 --> 00:38:00.272
I met him last week

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:02.992
He's in good health!

00:38:03.392 --> 00:38:05.472
He has not got..

00:38:05.752 --> 00:38:06.632
..infective hepatitis.

00:38:35.192 --> 00:38:36.672
What's the matter?

00:38:36.792 --> 00:38:38.792
What have both of you brothers started?

00:38:38.872 --> 00:38:40.912
I heard every word you both said

00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:45.432
Amazing

00:38:50.472 --> 00:38:52.512
My own brother...

00:38:53.592 --> 00:38:55.672
...said all this in my house!

00:38:56.472 --> 00:38:58.272
I'm not surprised in the least

00:39:02.552 --> 00:39:05.312
How little I know of him

00:39:06.632 --> 00:39:09.832
But such a violent reaction...
I didn't even dream of it...

00:39:10.952 --> 00:39:12.592
As if the temple is his own!

00:39:12.672 --> 00:39:15.312
What if your brother
dresses like an Englishman

00:39:16.112 --> 00:39:17.992
Sanctity will be finished for
ever because of his negligence

00:39:18.352 --> 00:39:20.712
Says that water is
purified by Tulsi leaves

00:39:21.352 --> 00:39:23.232
There's no contamination in Holy water!

00:39:23.832 --> 00:39:25.192
Ever heard of such things!

00:39:28.112 --> 00:39:29.072
Have you?

00:39:29.872 --> 00:39:31.272
I have...

00:39:31.752 --> 00:39:34.272
...in my childhood... from my father

00:39:37.192 --> 00:39:38.472
Amazing !

00:39:38.952 --> 00:39:40.832
Only now science has become important...

00:39:41.672 --> 00:39:42.952
It wasn't there then

00:39:49.232 --> 00:39:51.552
Don't you care to go to the temple?

00:40:03.672 --> 00:40:06.352
Maya, look at me

00:40:08.912 --> 00:40:10.352
Tell me truly

00:40:11.232 --> 00:40:13.032
Don't you care to go to the temple?

00:40:15.152 --> 00:40:17.432
Why this question?
- Tell me!

00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:21.832
Now I...

00:40:22.552 --> 00:40:25.272
I don't want anything between us!

00:40:27.752 --> 00:40:28.792
Earlier?

00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:33.512
You don't believe in religion.
I'm not upset

00:40:35.872 --> 00:40:38.472
Earlier, perhaps

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:43.792
Now I understand ...

00:40:44.872 --> 00:40:48.632
... that a man, not knowing everything,
can still be honest

00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:53.752
What's the use of being honest

00:40:56.432 --> 00:40:57.872
Use ?

00:40:58.352 --> 00:41:01.072
I understand, if you don't

00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:04.752
Be cool and think ...

00:41:04.832 --> 00:41:05.792
What to do !

00:41:06.232 --> 00:41:08.832
If Nishit sided with me
it would've been good ...

00:41:10.232 --> 00:41:11.032
... but

00:41:11.592 --> 00:41:13.712
... without him, much needs to be done

00:41:14.232 --> 00:41:15.872
How can you say this ?

00:41:18.232 --> 00:41:19.592
I'm not alone

00:41:21.152 --> 00:41:23.552
Backing me is a progressive newspaper

00:41:24.832 --> 00:41:30.032
They are publishing an
important article about this situation

00:41:31.272 --> 00:41:33.512
The printer of this paper
Adhirbabu is Chairman of

00:41:33.592 --> 00:41:35.992
... there
co-opertative Housing societies

00:41:36.632 --> 00:41:40.912
He has assured me that all his
members will support me, always

00:41:42.072 --> 00:41:44.792
Now how can I say that I'm alone?

00:41:50.872 --> 00:41:56.112
There are still obstructions to overcome

00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:02.272
"It has not gone again
and it is still here."

00:42:02.352 --> 00:42:05.312
"The darkness. Not yet."

00:42:05.672 --> 00:42:09.872
"It has not gone again
and it is still here."

00:42:09.952 --> 00:42:13.752
"The darkness. Not gone yet."

00:42:21.392 --> 00:42:28.032
"Life is not yet over."

00:42:29.512 --> 00:42:30.272
Mother,

00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:33.592
...Father has written so well
and you're singing a sad song ?

00:42:34.352 --> 00:42:34.952
Yes. Thanks.

00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:38.232
Tell me truly how it needs ?
- Very good

00:42:38.752 --> 00:42:41.912
But will Janavarta
publish this, father ?

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:42.872
Why not?

00:42:43.592 --> 00:42:45.072
They've done so before.

00:42:45.152 --> 00:42:46.752
Is this the same sort of Article?

00:42:47.072 --> 00:42:49.272
You've never written
such a bold Article before

00:42:49.672 --> 00:42:51.392
You're talking about not
drinking holy water...

00:42:51.472 --> 00:42:52.632
...closing down the temple

00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:55.032
That's to prevent the spread of disease

00:42:55.392 --> 00:42:56.952
Nothing to do with religion

00:42:57.032 --> 00:42:59.232
Janavarta won't be able to
distinguish between the two

00:43:00.872 --> 00:43:02.712
But Haridas told me he would himself

00:43:04.992 --> 00:43:07.432
I doubt even more
- Why ?

00:43:08.512 --> 00:43:10.112
I don't care for him a bit

00:43:10.832 --> 00:43:12.312
He just stares at woman !

00:43:13.432 --> 00:43:15.112
That's your impression ?

00:43:15.512 --> 00:43:17.792
I don't doubt, Haridas is a good person

00:43:18.832 --> 00:43:19.832
I hope...

00:43:20.432 --> 00:43:21.952
...that it's an error of judgement

00:43:22.192 --> 00:43:23.712
Should I sing a happy song ?

00:43:24.552 --> 00:43:26.632
Both of you are arguing

00:43:26.712 --> 00:43:29.112
Ranu's wrong, the
article will be published

00:43:30.032 --> 00:43:31.472
I hope so

00:43:32.472 --> 00:43:34.552
No one speaks the truth any more

00:43:35.032 --> 00:43:38.112
If its published, won't
your brother take revenge ?

00:43:38.712 --> 00:43:41.152
Isn't sit helpless in fear of Nishit

00:43:41.712 --> 00:43:43.112
I must do my duty

00:43:43.712 --> 00:43:44.872
I admit that ...

00:43:45.512 --> 00:43:46.992
... but I'm very scared

00:43:47.912 --> 00:43:49.672
I know Nishit well

00:43:51.312 --> 00:43:54.232
You were never close to each other

00:43:56.072 --> 00:43:58.032
I haven't forgotten anything

00:43:58.832 --> 00:44:01.392
Remember what happened
after father-in-law's death ?

00:44:01.712 --> 00:44:02.992
Yes, indeed

00:44:04.192 --> 00:44:06.072
I've never said anything to Ranu

00:44:06.872 --> 00:44:08.592
She'd just been born then

00:44:10.152 --> 00:44:11.552
What happened then ?

00:44:11.872 --> 00:44:13.152
Your grandfather ...

00:44:13.912 --> 00:44:15.552
... was very fond of good things ...

00:44:16.432 --> 00:44:19.392
... being a lawyer he
saved quite a bit ...

00:44:20.552 --> 00:44:22.552
...but spent it all

00:44:24.352 --> 00:44:28.312
At the age of 60, he
left behind a huge debt

00:44:30.112 --> 00:44:32.032
Nishit was working then

00:44:32.872 --> 00:44:36.832
But didn't spend a
farthing in repayment of that debt

00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:41.432
Your father sweated and toiled ...

00:44:41.992 --> 00:44:44.952
... to pay back, all by himself

00:44:45.472 --> 00:44:48.752
How I managed this family only I know !

00:44:49.472 --> 00:44:51.072
Am I worried for nothing ?

00:44:51.152 --> 00:44:53.352
They must publish this article

00:44:53.992 --> 00:44:55.912
I'll give it to them just now

00:44:56.152 --> 00:44:57.312
So late ?

00:44:57.392 --> 00:45:00.512
I've informed Haridas,
he'll wait at the office

00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:20.392
I'm very scared, mother
- Am I any less afraid ?

00:45:22.672 --> 00:45:25.632
The honest suffer the most !

00:45:30.872 --> 00:45:33.952
Please stand in a queue.

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:37.952
Hey, priest. Please
perform the veneration.

00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:40.952
Mother, give me another sweet.

00:45:42.632 --> 00:45:43.392
Please give me some holy water.

00:45:45.672 --> 00:45:47.952
Please give me some holy water.

00:46:12.192 --> 00:46:12.952
Read it ?

00:46:14.632 --> 00:46:18.552
I shiver to think what such an
article in our paper will do

00:46:20.272 --> 00:46:21.152
Listen ...

00:46:22.432 --> 00:46:23.672
For the last 26 years...

00:46:23.752 --> 00:46:25.952
...I have been a medical
practitioner in Chandipur

00:46:26.432 --> 00:46:30.672
I'm saying that nothing so
dangerous has been faced here before

00:46:31.312 --> 00:46:34.512
If no action is taken at once,
there'll be an epidemic

00:46:35.032 --> 00:46:38.152
This action not only
depends on this organization ...

00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:39.832
... people also have to participate

00:46:39.912 --> 00:46:41.792
Is very sad ...

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:45.592
... that the water of
Tirupeshwar temple has been proved ...

00:46:45.672 --> 00:46:47.032
... to be contaminated ...

00:46:47.352 --> 00:46:50.712
... for religious and household
work if this water is used ...

00:46:50.792 --> 00:46:53.472
... there'll be no way to
protect from these complicated diseases

00:46:53.952 --> 00:46:56.472
This water should be
immediately purified

00:46:56.832 --> 00:47:00.272
This is the only way to
safeguard Chandipur from this disaster

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:04.232
There's no
comparison to this article ...

00:47:04.552 --> 00:47:07.192
It will bring about awarness

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:12.472
That's what I doubt? How?

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:18.072
Seventeen letters have been posted to us

00:47:18.832 --> 00:47:20.032
Letters ?

00:47:20.112 --> 00:47:21.352
From readers

00:47:21.832 --> 00:47:22.792
What do they say ?

00:47:24.192 --> 00:47:25.752
Ashok Gupta is wrong ...

00:47:26.952 --> 00:47:28.792
Chandipur's water cannot be impure

00:47:28.872 --> 00:47:33.352
They're fools !
Disputing scientific evidence !

00:47:33.432 --> 00:47:34.992
Why are you listening to them ?

00:47:35.832 --> 00:47:40.512
When the article is published our
prestige will increase tenfold !

00:47:41.232 --> 00:47:43.672
We've never published
anything like this ...

00:47:43.752 --> 00:47:45.632
... nor has Dr.Gupta
ever written such things !

00:47:47.872 --> 00:47:49.552
I don't know the man ...

00:47:50.072 --> 00:47:54.512
... but reading the article
I've developed a respect for him

00:47:54.592 --> 00:47:56.072
I can hardly

00:47:56.432 --> 00:48:00.032
He's one in a million ...
Shouldn't we support him ?

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.512
Adhirbabu always says to
keep one's distance ...

00:48:05.152 --> 00:48:07.072
... but we can't
think like that any more

00:48:07.152 --> 00:48:10.872
This is like the hammer on the head.
This is today's situation

00:48:11.072 --> 00:48:11.992
Busy ?

00:48:12.232 --> 00:48:14.712
Come in Sir ! We were
just talking about you !

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:15.952
Really ?

00:48:16.512 --> 00:48:19.152
Our Assistant editor, Biresh Guha

00:48:19.592 --> 00:48:21.552
He's just read your article - I see.

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:24.592
I'm honored ...

00:48:26.032 --> 00:48:29.952
I've never read such
a good article ever!

00:48:29.992 --> 00:48:32.272
Thank you, I am happy to hear that

00:48:32.352 --> 00:48:36.752
If this is the view of the
Assistant editor, what does the Editor say?

00:48:37.232 --> 00:48:39.552
You know I'm one of your followers ...

00:48:39.632 --> 00:48:41.672
Well then ? Publish it!

00:48:42.072 --> 00:48:45.672
Let me tell you something ...

00:48:46.392 --> 00:48:49.792
The morning post has brought
these seventeen letters ...

00:48:49.992 --> 00:48:51.392
Letters ?

00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:54.512
They can't believe that
Chandipur's water can be contaminated

00:48:57.752 --> 00:48:58.752
I see !

00:49:00.552 --> 00:49:03.352
They think Chandipur is Heaven!

00:49:04.352 --> 00:49:06.712
They refuse to bear
anything bad about it

00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:10.352
But there are other
people as well Haridas...

00:49:10.872 --> 00:49:13.032
Even among your readers itself

00:49:13.712 --> 00:49:17.432
Even if they believe that
Chandipur is an ideal town...

00:49:17.912 --> 00:49:20.392
...a disaster is not impossible here!

00:49:20.832 --> 00:49:24.992
They don't refute scientific
evidence unlike illiterates

00:49:25.872 --> 00:49:29.072
They are aware of the
disaster an epidemic can cause!

00:49:29.752 --> 00:49:32.392
That this will be a great
disaster for the city...

00:49:32.432 --> 00:49:36.152
...and that it must be
prevented they firmly believe

00:49:37.352 --> 00:49:39.352
These are my readers, Haridas!

00:49:39.992 --> 00:49:43.192
I don't believe that if
you publish my article...

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:45.272
...they'll refuse it

00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:46.992
You print it

00:49:47.072 --> 00:49:48.312
Greetings, doctor.

00:49:49.072 --> 00:49:51.632
Hearing your voice I thought I'd stop by

00:49:51.832 --> 00:49:53.352
Have you read my article?

00:49:53.432 --> 00:49:56.912
Not yet, I will in a while

00:49:58.152 --> 00:50:00.272
I hope this won't spoil everything

00:50:00.992 --> 00:50:03.792
If you've thought of me while writing

00:50:04.032 --> 00:50:05.832
I wouldn't worry at all

00:50:06.792 --> 00:50:07.792
Of you?

00:50:08.392 --> 00:50:10.832
The question of limit

00:50:11.632 --> 00:50:13.792
I'll be in trouble, if
it exceeds that limit

00:50:14.992 --> 00:50:16.472
Listen to me

00:50:17.072 --> 00:50:22.152
The danger for Chandipur is a
thousand times more than that for you

00:50:22.832 --> 00:50:24.832
Can't think of oneself anymore!

00:50:25.352 --> 00:50:28.112
There's shadow of a
calamity over the city today

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:32.232
And the only way to protect it,
is by publishing my article

00:50:35.272 --> 00:50:36.592
If you say so...

00:50:36.672 --> 00:50:39.112
I loudly say so Ajit

00:50:39.192 --> 00:50:42.392
I need your support for this article

00:50:43.392 --> 00:50:44.352
All right

00:50:45.072 --> 00:50:47.752
I'll just come back to
collect your article

00:50:49.712 --> 00:50:51.672
Then I'll go. I have a patient.

00:50:52.152 --> 00:50:53.552
Give the article for composing

00:50:53.632 --> 00:50:55.192
I'll check the proof in the evening

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:56.152
Come on.

00:50:56.232 --> 00:50:56.912
Now..

00:50:58.392 --> 00:50:59.072
What is it?

00:51:00.072 --> 00:51:03.032
We have to take a
great risk doing this...

00:51:03.312 --> 00:51:04.992
...hope you appreciate it

00:51:05.472 --> 00:51:09.352
If you don't take any risk,
why call yourself progressive?

00:51:10.432 --> 00:51:14.112
You say your readers
decide what should be said...

00:51:14.792 --> 00:51:16.792
It's also your duty to enlighten them up

00:51:17.152 --> 00:51:19.072
To influence their thinking!

00:51:20.112 --> 00:51:21.152
Remember that!

00:51:31.992 --> 00:51:33.872
Ajit babu will shiver at the article

00:51:35.512 --> 00:51:37.392
Yes, he's very cowardly

00:51:38.672 --> 00:51:41.472
And he's become whimsical
about keeping safe distance!

00:51:43.272 --> 00:51:45.632
Can't we exist without him?

00:51:46.832 --> 00:51:48.312
How can we?

00:51:48.992 --> 00:51:51.832
When in trouble, who will
finance our printing costs?

00:51:53.432 --> 00:51:54.752
That's true!

00:51:56.272 --> 00:51:59.272
But don't support him at all
with regard to this article

00:51:59.312 --> 00:52:00.832
...it is only...

00:52:04.032 --> 00:52:04.832
Come in

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:09.712
Come in.

00:52:15.952 --> 00:52:18.792
Your father was just here? -is it?

00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:22.792
Thought I'd return your
book during the break!

00:52:24.512 --> 00:52:26.312
The translation?

00:52:26.992 --> 00:52:28.832
Have you read the book

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:32.472
No, but I've heard it, its very popular

00:52:32.552 --> 00:52:34.752
That's why I thought
we'd publish it on Sunday

00:52:35.312 --> 00:52:38.032
I read it last night
It's a terrible story

00:52:39.032 --> 00:52:41.352
It has no link to your values

00:52:42.672 --> 00:52:45.072
Why? What does it say?

00:52:45.792 --> 00:52:47.992
Nothing in it rings true

00:52:48.072 --> 00:52:50.112
It says there's
supernatural force on earth...

00:52:50.752 --> 00:52:55.992
...Which protects the good
and punishes the wrongdoers

00:52:56.672 --> 00:52:58.952
Can you imagine anything so foolish?

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.472
You're laughing?

00:53:04.792 --> 00:53:05.832
Indrani.

00:53:06.992 --> 00:53:08.152
Unfortunately..

00:53:08.632 --> 00:53:10.272
..our readers want this.

00:53:11.712 --> 00:53:14.232
We have to earn some money
to increase our circulation

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:16.952
Would we publish this
if we had a strong base?

00:53:17.752 --> 00:53:20.312
You keep saying, your
circulation is poor...

00:53:21.152 --> 00:53:23.632
...but seeing your office
its difficult to believe

00:53:24.512 --> 00:53:25.632
Anyway...

00:53:26.272 --> 00:53:28.032
I won't translate it!

00:53:28.472 --> 00:53:30.832
Because I don't believe a word of it

00:53:31.272 --> 00:53:33.912
I can't imagine how you're
thinking of publishing this!

00:53:34.272 --> 00:53:37.312
Especially when you're
publishing an article like this

00:53:38.392 --> 00:53:39.912
Are you speaking of
your father's article?

00:53:40.792 --> 00:53:44.352
Aren't you printing that?
- We're thinking about it

00:53:45.952 --> 00:53:48.032
Here you will be doing a
service to everyone...

00:53:49.472 --> 00:53:51.472
...If it's printed...

00:53:52.512 --> 00:53:54.312
Do you know why?

00:53:54.712 --> 00:53:56.472
...I do... -What?

00:53:57.072 --> 00:53:59.232
My father speaks the truth, boldly...

00:53:59.832 --> 00:54:01.792
and writes well, that's why

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:03.432
...That's true...

00:54:05.072 --> 00:54:06.672
there's one more reason

00:54:07.752 --> 00:54:08.672
What?

00:54:10.272 --> 00:54:11.152
He is...

00:54:12.712 --> 00:54:14.352
...your father!

00:54:16.032 --> 00:54:17.712
What are you saying?

00:54:18.472 --> 00:54:20.192
It's the truth

00:54:20.912 --> 00:54:24.552
I've been so often to your
father's place to collect writing

00:54:25.192 --> 00:54:29.032
...one reason was to see you,
which you don't understand

00:54:30.112 --> 00:54:32.352
I don't understand nor do I want to know

00:54:32.432 --> 00:54:34.272
Don't be angry Indrani

00:54:35.712 --> 00:54:38.272
It's not that I
don't respect your father

00:54:38.752 --> 00:54:39.912
Respect?

00:54:40.192 --> 00:54:43.312
You're cheating my father!

00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:45.392
What sort of a man are you?

00:54:47.752 --> 00:54:50.152
You're talking a bit angrily

00:54:52.312 --> 00:54:53.752
Is this the right time

00:54:54.952 --> 00:54:56.152
Why not now?

00:54:57.392 --> 00:55:00.232
If Janavarta does
not help your father...

00:55:00.792 --> 00:55:02.592
he won't have any support

00:55:04.512 --> 00:55:06.472
I see! ... I'm leaving!

00:55:17.712 --> 00:55:19.712
I couldn't tell you as you had a visitor

00:55:19.912 --> 00:55:21.872
The Municipal Chairman is here!

00:55:27.592 --> 00:55:29.472
Sorry, sir. I made you wait!

00:55:29.832 --> 00:55:31.752
I was seeing your office
- Come

00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:36.712
Was that my niece?
- I had given her a book to translate

00:55:39.112 --> 00:55:39.712
Sit down.

00:55:40.872 --> 00:55:41.752
Sit down.

00:55:46.432 --> 00:55:47.712
How can I help?

00:55:48.472 --> 00:55:50.952
Today there's been an unwanted incident

00:55:51.512 --> 00:55:52.352
Like?

00:55:53.792 --> 00:55:55.672
It's my brother

00:55:56.832 --> 00:56:00.512
He has sent a report to the
authorities and the municipal

00:56:01.472 --> 00:56:02.672
Despite of my warning

00:56:03.712 --> 00:56:05.432
The report is dangerous

00:56:06.752 --> 00:56:08.112
I know about it

00:56:09.832 --> 00:56:10.552
How?

00:56:10.872 --> 00:56:12.832
He has sent a report based on that

00:56:12.912 --> 00:56:14.072
Have you read it?

00:56:15.632 --> 00:56:16.512
Yes.

00:56:23.232 --> 00:56:27.112
I have -Will it be published?

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.712
I can't decide yet!

00:56:32.792 --> 00:56:33.712
Actually.. - No!

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:38.872
Do you realise the danger
of publishing this report?

00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:42.432
He says stop giving holy
water close the temple

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.752
Dig out the underground
pipe and fix a new pipe line

00:56:45.832 --> 00:56:48.752
Can't you see? This is
the ranting of a mad man ?

00:56:49.592 --> 00:56:51.232
Will your readers agree to this?

00:56:51.552 --> 00:56:53.472
The doctor's article... -Just a minute

00:56:53.872 --> 00:56:57.232
Has he come to take the
article to compose it?

00:56:57.752 --> 00:57:00.952
He's our printer and publisher

00:57:01.712 --> 00:57:03.152
Printer and publisher?

00:57:04.192 --> 00:57:05.592
Greetings, Mr. Chairman.

00:57:06.872 --> 00:57:08.632
Have you read Ashok's article?

00:57:09.352 --> 00:57:12.232
You mean Dr. Gupta's article?

00:57:12.712 --> 00:57:13.952
Yes, he's my elder brother

00:57:14.392 --> 00:57:15.992
No. I haven't, I'll now

00:57:16.592 --> 00:57:21.552
Do you know, you'll be in
trouble if you publish this

00:57:21.832 --> 00:57:25.272
I'm not aware of this

00:57:25.952 --> 00:57:27.632
Do you go to the temple?

00:57:28.312 --> 00:57:32.152
I do
- sometimes!

00:57:33.192 --> 00:57:35.552
Do you take holy water?

00:57:36.192 --> 00:57:37.672
Is that wrong?

00:57:39.352 --> 00:57:40.392
From now...

00:57:41.832 --> 00:57:44.472
You can't -Why not?

00:57:45.272 --> 00:57:47.152
By the ordering Ashok Gupta

00:57:47.832 --> 00:57:51.512
And by his order the temple
will be closed indefinitely

00:57:52.032 --> 00:57:52.712
What?

00:57:53.472 --> 00:57:55.832
Is all this in his article? -It is

00:57:57.272 --> 00:57:59.672
Are you telling me to publish this?

00:58:01.832 --> 00:58:03.552
Listen, Haridas

00:58:04.352 --> 00:58:07.512
I've brought a circular...
from the municipality

00:58:08.352 --> 00:58:10.112
I'll read it to you

00:58:12.672 --> 00:58:15.592
On behalf of Chandipur municipality,
we inform you...

00:58:15.832 --> 00:58:19.152
...that with regards to water,
in part of this town...

00:58:19.432 --> 00:58:22.992
Some person are
spreading false rumours...

00:58:24.032 --> 00:58:29.032
We notify the public not to be
alarmed by malignant rumours

00:58:29.792 --> 00:58:34.232
We've engaged specialist to test
the water in many parts of the town

00:58:34.472 --> 00:58:38.712
And understand that this
water is harmless for drinking

00:58:39.632 --> 00:58:45.912
We condemn the vicious attempt
to spread such false rumours....

00:58:46.472 --> 00:58:49.032
Chairman Chandipur municipality!

00:58:50.032 --> 00:58:53.352
Dr. Gupta's here He's
getting out of his car

00:58:54.432 --> 00:58:58.472
Please escort the chairman
to your room, sir please...

00:58:58.672 --> 00:58:59.512
Why?

00:59:00.112 --> 00:59:02.792
Why should I go? I'll stay here

00:59:11.232 --> 00:59:13.872
Am I seeing my youngest brother?

00:59:14.912 --> 00:59:19.672
Are you here to see my
article is not published?

00:59:20.392 --> 00:59:22.112
That's the main idea!

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:24.752
You won't succeed

00:59:26.112 --> 00:59:29.672
You may not be aware that I
came by here some time ago

00:59:30.472 --> 00:59:33.592
I came again to make a correction!

00:59:33.872 --> 00:59:37.432
Give me the article please.
-I haven't got it yet

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:45.392
Janavarta is publishing my article

00:59:46.952 --> 00:59:51.032
People not aware that the
epidemic is spreading in the city...

00:59:51.392 --> 00:59:52.752
...they will know tomorrow

00:59:59.912 --> 01:00:02.552
I believe people will take my advice...

01:00:03.552 --> 01:00:06.832
...and that ... will
be good for Chandipur

01:00:10.832 --> 01:00:13.432
Is Haridas given you his word?

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:14.632
Of course!

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:15.992
Well?

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:19.712
What do you say, Haridas?

01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:22.512
No. I mean...

01:00:22.592 --> 01:00:24.272
Speak up, clearly!

01:00:25.952 --> 01:00:28.272
I thought I'd support Dr.Gupta...

01:00:29.472 --> 01:00:31.712
...before reading the article!

01:00:32.392 --> 01:00:34.752
Now it's not possible

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:36.312
Then say so!

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:55.472
What?

01:00:56.752 --> 01:00:58.432
What's this Haridas?

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:03.032
You came in suddenly and I
couldn't tell you! Openly!

01:01:04.072 --> 01:01:06.912
We can't publish your article. Dr. Gupta

01:01:07.552 --> 01:01:10.232
We are running Janavarta...

01:01:11.112 --> 01:01:13.072
...the way you've
brought up the temple...

01:01:13.152 --> 01:01:15.872
You mean what I said
about the temple is all lies?

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.392
It's not what I mean....

01:01:18.832 --> 01:01:20.552
It's public opinion

01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:23.392
We can't ignore that in a newspaper

01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:25.312
Whether this is public opinion...

01:01:25.392 --> 01:01:26.632
...or not how to know in advance?

01:01:27.192 --> 01:01:28.552
Are you God?

01:01:29.072 --> 01:01:30.912
Do you know the pulse of the people

01:01:31.592 --> 01:01:33.632
We are running the
paper for 12 years now,

01:01:33.712 --> 01:01:35.312
....we've some experience

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.752
Print this and see what happens!

01:01:37.832 --> 01:01:39.312
I'll take the entire responsibility

01:01:40.352 --> 01:01:42.112
If we do so,

01:01:42.192 --> 01:01:44.632
...then our circulation
will down to one quarter

01:01:45.312 --> 01:01:46.872
Then we'll have to close down

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:57.912
But you said a while ago...

01:02:00.952 --> 01:02:03.392
...you spoke so much
yesterday at my house...

01:02:08.352 --> 01:02:08.992
Hello.

01:02:11.152 --> 01:02:12.552
Call after half an hour

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:17.232
Omit the part about the temple...

01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:18.912
and I'll publish it!

01:02:23.512 --> 01:02:28.272
I'm a doctor, haven't
I a duty to society?

01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:32.072
The water contains bacteria...

01:02:32.872 --> 01:02:35.312
...can't I say it in a daily paper?

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:39.512
I am very sorry, Dr. Gupta.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:42.272
Are you human?

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:51.312
And you?

01:02:52.432 --> 01:02:54.352
If you write like this,

01:02:54.952 --> 01:02:56.792
how can I give you moral support?

01:02:57.832 --> 01:02:59.512
My members themselves will...

01:02:59.672 --> 01:03:01.672
...how can I ask them to print it?

01:03:08.752 --> 01:03:09.792
I've left the matter,

01:03:10.392 --> 01:03:11.832
...see that is printed
on tomorrow's front page

01:03:11.912 --> 01:03:12.752
Okay.

01:03:13.192 --> 01:03:16.072
What do you think? You
can't stop my mouth so easily?

01:03:17.152 --> 01:03:18.912
I'll read it out at the meeting

01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:20.792
People will hear about it,

01:03:20.832 --> 01:03:22.352
even if they don't read about it!

01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:23.352
Meeting?

01:03:24.632 --> 01:03:26.152
Where will it be?

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:27.512
Why?

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.472
Ramanar Hall... Vivekananda Hall!

01:03:31.192 --> 01:03:32.752
You won't get either

01:03:34.272 --> 01:03:36.152
Is that what you'll arrange?

01:03:39.712 --> 01:03:40.672
All right

01:03:41.592 --> 01:03:43.072
I don't need a hall

01:03:43.912 --> 01:03:45.432
I'll call a meeting in the open air!

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:47.952
I'll be present there!

01:03:49.232 --> 01:03:51.592
You want to ruin my speech...

01:03:52.232 --> 01:03:54.632
...but what if the
epidemic spreads in Chandipur?

01:03:55.192 --> 01:03:56.112
In that case...

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.672
...it will not be because of holy water

01:04:06.792 --> 01:04:07.912
Very well.

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:12.392
I'm inviting all of you to my lecture

01:04:13.072 --> 01:04:14.552
I'll see what you do!

01:04:35.752 --> 01:04:36.832
You want to say something?

01:04:38.592 --> 01:04:40.672
What have you done?

01:04:42.752 --> 01:04:43.672
Meaning?

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:45.992
You won't publish this article?

01:04:46.672 --> 01:04:48.352
You've gone back your word!

01:04:50.032 --> 01:04:51.312
Look Biresh

01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:53.952
I am the editor of this paper

01:04:54.512 --> 01:04:56.912
I'll decide what to
publish and what not to!

01:04:58.232 --> 01:04:59.672
By publishing the article...

01:05:00.992 --> 01:05:03.352
I believe, Janavarta would
have gained a good name...

01:05:03.992 --> 01:05:06.112
...and supported a true human!

01:05:07.192 --> 01:05:09.152
How are you denying the crisis?

01:05:09.432 --> 01:05:11.472
The epidemic is there!

01:05:11.552 --> 01:05:13.952
I don't want to
discuss this with you anymore

01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:15.752
Go back to your room!

01:05:49.672 --> 01:05:51.952
What's this? You're here at this hour?

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:54.232
Your father phoned me

01:05:55.032 --> 01:05:56.392
Where's he? Hasn't he returned?

01:05:56.992 --> 01:05:59.032
He has, he's with a patient

01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:02.472
Why did he phone? -It's a long story

01:06:03.232 --> 01:06:05.712
Janavarta will not
publish your father's article.

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.072
They have refused.

01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:09.032
I knew it!

01:06:09.472 --> 01:06:12.112
I went there to return
their book this afternoon

01:06:13.272 --> 01:06:15.112
Haridas is an awful man...

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.472
...and so is their paper!

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:21.872
Now your father wants to
spread his article by lecturing!

01:06:22.352 --> 01:06:23.992
But no hall is available

01:06:24.552 --> 01:06:25.592
Why?

01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:28.712
Your uncle, has made such arrangements!

01:06:30.752 --> 01:06:32.032
What injustice!

01:06:32.512 --> 01:06:34.352
Think of it....

01:06:34.792 --> 01:06:36.952
The brothers are like opponents!

01:06:37.192 --> 01:06:41.592
He range me to arrange the
meeting in our Drama hall!

01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:44.112
I talked to your uncle.

01:06:44.832 --> 01:06:45.792
He agrees on one condition

01:06:46.272 --> 01:06:48.272
Do you know what your
uncle says of your father?

01:06:49.032 --> 01:06:50.352
When is the lecture?

01:06:51.152 --> 01:06:52.992
Sunday evening at six!

01:06:54.392 --> 01:06:57.072
The posters are being printed,
they'll be parted all over!

01:06:57.632 --> 01:07:00.192
You won't get into any trouble will you?

01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:02.432
I don't care,

01:07:02.912 --> 01:07:04.672
...don't you know me by now?

01:07:05.952 --> 01:07:07.112
Then I do!

01:07:07.752 --> 01:07:09.952
Is that you Ranu?
- Yes father

01:07:10.552 --> 01:07:12.392
I heard it all from Ronen

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.752
You were right

01:07:16.392 --> 01:07:17.672
I didn't know...

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.392
...Haridas at all!

01:07:22.232 --> 01:07:26.752
He pretends of a
progressive ...but he's no courage!

01:07:27.392 --> 01:07:28.872
No back bone!

01:07:29.552 --> 01:07:31.272
It's good in a way

01:07:31.992 --> 01:07:33.352
If it was published,

01:07:33.712 --> 01:07:36.032
...your father would have lost his job

01:07:36.112 --> 01:07:40.512
Anyway you've arranged the
lecture...like a true friend!

01:07:41.272 --> 01:07:44.712
My only aim is to let
people know the situation...

01:07:44.832 --> 01:07:46.992
Tomorrow there'll be
a notice in the paper

01:07:47.232 --> 01:07:48.312
What notice?

01:07:49.672 --> 01:07:52.472
That people shouldn't be worried...

01:07:52.512 --> 01:07:55.112
..that there's nothing
wrong with the water

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.192
I should have guessed it long ago....

01:07:57.832 --> 01:08:00.112
That by taking holy
water you'd fall ill...

01:08:00.432 --> 01:08:02.112
...no Hindu would agree

01:08:02.632 --> 01:08:04.392
But it is true that...

01:08:05.432 --> 01:08:09.712
...keeping the matter hanging
will banning about one thing...

01:08:11.832 --> 01:08:13.552
...an epidemic!

01:08:16.032 --> 01:08:19.272
Lecture. Time : 15 January, 1989, Sunday

01:08:21.032 --> 01:08:24.672
Subject: Health Hazard in Chandipur

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:31.712
Speaker: Dr. Ashok Gupta
Venue: Halder Drama Hall

01:08:40.112 --> 01:08:44.032
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8..

01:08:44.112 --> 01:08:46.232
..9, 10. Hello. Hello.

01:08:46.272 --> 01:08:47.472
Hello. Hello.

01:08:47.552 --> 01:08:50.992
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8..

01:08:51.232 --> 01:08:53.752
..9, 10. Hello. Hello.

01:08:54.392 --> 01:08:56.312
So you have come?
-Yes! - Come and sit down.

01:08:56.392 --> 01:08:59.032
I attend all public meetings!

01:09:00.152 --> 01:09:02.592
What's the subject? I
entered seeing the crowd!

01:09:02.632 --> 01:09:03.912
Don't ask me!

01:09:03.992 --> 01:09:07.752
He'll talk something about health !

01:09:08.112 --> 01:09:09.552
The health of Chandipur?

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:12.472
I think its about that
water problem we had here

01:09:12.832 --> 01:09:15.272
That came in the papers,
didn't you read it?

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:19.752
No. -That was refused by the Chairman

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:23.352
I'm here to listen to what he says

01:09:53.072 --> 01:09:56.192
Did you see? My
opponents are present also!

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.232
Where?

01:09:59.272 --> 01:10:00.912
Look ahead

01:10:07.192 --> 01:10:08.512
How are they here?

01:10:09.632 --> 01:10:11.512
I called them

01:10:14.072 --> 01:10:16.512
The things you get upto....

01:10:17.272 --> 01:10:17.912
Mother.

01:10:18.752 --> 01:10:19.952
Here's uncle

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.112
Did you call him as well?

01:10:26.872 --> 01:10:28.432
He himself said he'd come!

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:30.832
It's a public meeting...

01:10:31.232 --> 01:10:33.072
...I can't stop people from coming

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.832
I'll propose you as president

01:10:45.192 --> 01:10:46.272
President?

01:10:47.232 --> 01:10:50.952
With you here? -I have a problem.

01:10:51.512 --> 01:10:54.992
Haridas. You'll second my proposal

01:10:55.512 --> 01:10:56.232
All right !

01:10:56.552 --> 01:11:01.472
I wish to say something
before Ashok, please announce it

01:11:03.312 --> 01:11:05.552
If there's time, I'll
request you to speak also

01:11:06.592 --> 01:11:07.512
Me? -Yes

01:11:07.592 --> 01:11:11.112
You've read the article
and can give your opinion

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.552
They're discussing some plans!

01:11:22.592 --> 01:11:24.312
It doesn't look good!

01:11:26.712 --> 01:11:27.872
Just a minute

01:11:33.512 --> 01:11:36.192
Listen, I don't like the looks of things

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:40.032
The opponents are all here.
I am depending on you

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:43.272
Don't worry! We are ready.

01:11:43.552 --> 01:11:44.512
Good.

01:12:01.272 --> 01:12:03.432
Dr. Gupta, isn't it time?

01:12:04.952 --> 01:12:07.352
Yes, it is. -Start then!

01:12:22.232 --> 01:12:23.232
Just a minute

01:12:27.392 --> 01:12:30.272
I think we should elect a Chairman first

01:12:30.752 --> 01:12:31.832
Why?

01:12:32.472 --> 01:12:34.072
I'm only going to read a paper

01:12:34.152 --> 01:12:35.832
Who knows how people will react?

01:12:36.072 --> 01:12:37.992
You can't have a
meeting without the Chairman

01:12:38.552 --> 01:12:42.672
I propose the name of Adhir Mukherjee

01:12:43.072 --> 01:12:45.512
I second it

01:12:47.152 --> 01:12:47.952
Mr. Adhir.

01:12:48.752 --> 01:12:49.632
Come !

01:13:03.272 --> 01:13:09.632
Friends, as Chairman of this meeting....

01:13:10.192 --> 01:13:12.272
I will say only one thing

01:13:12.352 --> 01:13:14.792
Who are you?

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:21.392
I am the printer and
publisher of Janavarta. - I see.

01:13:21.552 --> 01:13:23.312
Carry on

01:13:27.632 --> 01:13:29.832
I will only say one thing

01:13:31.272 --> 01:13:33.392
I am a peace loving person

01:13:33.712 --> 01:13:38.272
I request the meeting
to be a peaceful one

01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:44.832
Before Dr. Gupta speaks ... our
Chairman of the Municipality...

01:13:44.872 --> 01:13:49.232
Dr. Nishit Gupta would
like to say a few words

01:13:49.432 --> 01:13:52.512
May I request him to do so

01:14:04.032 --> 01:14:05.232
Friends...

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:11.712
Today's speaker is
knows to me intimately

01:14:12.832 --> 01:14:15.552
I also know what he wants to say

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:20.352
I would like to ask,
if any one of you...

01:14:20.392 --> 01:14:25.912
...is willing to hear
words said against our temple

01:14:28.032 --> 01:14:30.792
No. Certainly not!

01:14:30.872 --> 01:14:34.232
We don't want to listen to
anything bad about the temple.

01:14:34.912 --> 01:14:41.872
But that is exactly what Dr.
Gupta wants to do!

01:14:42.832 --> 01:14:48.232
I propose that Dr. Gupta
should not be allowed to speak !

01:14:48.512 --> 01:14:51.672
We don't want to hear him!

01:14:51.952 --> 01:14:53.032
What?

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.632
We want to hear Dr. Gupta

01:14:59.712 --> 01:15:02.952
Speak Dr.Gupta. -Why isn't
he being allowed to speak?

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:05.912
Give the mike to Dr. Gupta, we
don't want to listen to you!

01:15:05.992 --> 01:15:08.352
Order. Order. Order!

01:15:13.632 --> 01:15:16.992
You've seen the notice of
Municipality in the papers

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.272
Many of you may have read it

01:15:19.912 --> 01:15:22.232
What I've said there is the truth

01:15:23.112 --> 01:15:26.272
Dr. Gupta says the
temple water is contaminated

01:15:26.752 --> 01:15:30.432
And the same water is
being drunk as holy water!

01:15:30.712 --> 01:15:34.912
I say that the holy
water can never be impure

01:15:35.992 --> 01:15:39.512
Dr. Gupta suggested that the
sample should've closed now...

01:15:39.592 --> 01:15:41.592
...and its water purified

01:15:42.072 --> 01:15:46.432
Do you accept such a proposal?

01:15:46.512 --> 01:15:48.312
No, no!

01:15:48.392 --> 01:15:52.072
You can't shut the temple down!

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:57.672
The editor of Janavarta is present here

01:15:59.072 --> 01:16:03.272
Gupta submitted the
article to the paper!

01:16:04.672 --> 01:16:09.072
The editor justifiably
refused to permit it

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:14.392
I request him to say a
few words on the subject

01:16:14.472 --> 01:16:16.312
We don't want to hear him?

01:16:16.392 --> 01:16:18.472
We've come to hear Dr. Gupta....

01:16:18.512 --> 01:16:20.592
...not the editor of Janavarta

01:16:21.392 --> 01:16:22.512
Friends,

01:16:27.232 --> 01:16:30.632
at first I believed
what Dr. Gupta said...

01:16:31.832 --> 01:16:34.592
...but later I was
forced to change my opinion

01:16:36.352 --> 01:16:40.752
I realised that if I am
to print his article ...

01:16:41.272 --> 01:16:43.112
...my readers will strongly object

01:16:44.832 --> 01:16:48.232
I had a cordial
relationship with Dr. Gupta

01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:55.192
I'd been to his house, had
tea and discussed many matters

01:16:56.512 --> 01:17:00.472
In fact, our paper has
carried many of his articles

01:17:02.232 --> 01:17:04.552
But, in this latest piece,

01:17:04.592 --> 01:17:07.472
he has remarked about our temple...

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:11.272
...which no one can approve of

01:17:12.872 --> 01:17:15.192
As the editor of a paper...

01:17:15.872 --> 01:17:18.832
...I cannot ignore public opinion!

01:17:20.472 --> 01:17:22.632
It was due to this....

01:17:23.752 --> 01:17:28.152
...that I turned
down Dr. Gupta's article

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:31.992
I personally feel...

01:17:33.112 --> 01:17:36.792
...that what Dr.
Gupta says is not correct

01:17:38.672 --> 01:17:39.512
What is he saying? -
What is happening here?

01:17:49.152 --> 01:17:55.392
I propose that we take
a vote on the proposal

01:17:55.592 --> 01:17:58.952
I wish to ask a question first

01:18:06.832 --> 01:18:07.912
Go ahead!

01:18:13.312 --> 01:18:15.432
Is this a meeting...

01:18:15.832 --> 01:18:17.592
...or a farce?

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:19.712
I called the meeting!

01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:22.552
It was my notices
which brought the people...

01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:24.032
...to hear me speak

01:18:25.112 --> 01:18:27.552
Let them hear me
first and then decide...

01:18:27.632 --> 01:18:29.432
...if I'm right or wrong

01:18:30.192 --> 01:18:32.552
Let the municipal
chairman say what he wishes!

01:18:33.232 --> 01:18:35.592
Why must you take his
word as gospel truth?

01:18:36.072 --> 01:18:38.192
You've taken the trouble to come here.

01:18:38.352 --> 01:18:40.072
Listen to me first...

01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:42.152
Let me be allowed to speak

01:18:42.232 --> 01:18:44.192
We don't want to hear
talk against the temple.

01:18:44.272 --> 01:18:45.992
Dr. Gupta keep quiet.

01:18:47.832 --> 01:18:49.392
Yes, yes. Dr. Gupta.
Please be quiet. - Yes, yes.

01:18:49.472 --> 01:18:52.272
I refused to be silenced so easily

01:18:53.152 --> 01:18:54.672
I love this town,

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:58.992
...the place of my birth most dearly!

01:18:59.752 --> 01:19:03.992
Whatever I've done as a
doctor is for the town's welfare !

01:19:04.472 --> 01:19:06.992
I've been practicing
here for 26 years now!

01:19:07.312 --> 01:19:09.712
It is possible...

01:19:09.792 --> 01:19:12.592
...that some of my
patients are amongst you!

01:19:13.072 --> 01:19:15.352
I wish to say that Dr.
Gupta is an eminent doctor...

01:19:15.512 --> 01:19:17.352
...he saved my life
when I was facing death

01:19:17.432 --> 01:19:19.072
I'm eternally grateful!

01:19:19.872 --> 01:19:21.472
Thank you Abani babu

01:19:22.392 --> 01:19:26.512
I wish to say that until quite recently,

01:19:26.592 --> 01:19:29.552
...our climate was healthy

01:19:30.152 --> 01:19:31.792
But no longer!

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:34.272
I have proof of that!

01:19:34.472 --> 01:19:36.752
And I want to tell you...

01:19:38.032 --> 01:19:41.072
Chandipur has never been
threatened with such disaster

01:19:41.312 --> 01:19:44.032
It is not that a healthy
climate cannot be restored...

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.952
...to avert disaster.

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:50.632
You must be told or how would you know?

01:19:50.672 --> 01:19:52.592
Tell me do you want to hear?

01:19:52.672 --> 01:19:54.352
Yes, we want to hear!

01:19:54.432 --> 01:19:57.312
Yes, speak up, we want to hear you!

01:20:25.552 --> 01:20:26.552
Friends,

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:30.552
what I'm trying to tell you tonight...

01:20:30.632 --> 01:20:31.872
Mr. Chairman...

01:20:33.752 --> 01:20:37.912
I wish to put a question to Dr.Gupta

01:20:38.472 --> 01:20:39.312
Please do...

01:20:47.712 --> 01:20:52.032
Do you call yourself a Hindu?
-What kind of question is that?

01:20:52.072 --> 01:20:54.072
There's a reason, answer

01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:57.872
Yes I'm one, I emphatically say so!

01:20:57.952 --> 01:21:00.592
There can be no doubt about that

01:21:01.032 --> 01:21:04.712
Have you been to our
temple in the last 10 years?

01:21:05.832 --> 01:21:07.952
Not in the manner that you mean!

01:21:08.032 --> 01:21:10.072
In other words, you don't pray!

01:21:10.152 --> 01:21:11.992
No -Why not?

01:21:12.352 --> 01:21:14.272
Don't you believe in such rituals?

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:19.032
I'll tell you the truth

01:21:20.152 --> 01:21:26.032
Certain customs of Hinduism,
I don't follow...

01:21:26.112 --> 01:21:28.272
Science has snapped my beliefs

01:21:28.872 --> 01:21:30.832
But that is personal

01:21:31.432 --> 01:21:34.792
I can't dream of
opposing the faith of someone...

01:21:34.872 --> 01:21:38.432
...who worships at the
temple and drinks the holy water!

01:21:39.432 --> 01:21:43.112
It has been proved that
the temple water has bacteria

01:21:43.192 --> 01:21:45.952
So I say that to drink
holy water at this stage..

01:21:46.032 --> 01:21:49.592
...or to drink any
water there is dangerous

01:21:49.632 --> 01:21:52.512
This is a question of hygiene,
not of religion

01:21:53.312 --> 01:21:58.112
I insist that the water
supply must be purified at once

01:21:58.632 --> 01:22:01.952
Then there can be no danger
in restoring temple rituals

01:22:05.472 --> 01:22:08.792
Do you know how many
people drink holy water?

01:22:09.352 --> 01:22:11.152
Do you?

01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:16.312
I find from the crowd
I see at the temple...

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:18.432
...about a thousand!

01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:23.472
How many cases of water
borne diseases have come to you?

01:22:23.552 --> 01:22:27.392
You can't look at it like that!
I'm not the only doctor here!

01:22:27.472 --> 01:22:29.192
Answer my question!

01:22:30.072 --> 01:22:34.632
In the last fortnight, I've
treated about 150 patients

01:22:34.712 --> 01:22:36.472
Many of them have died

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:38.192
I'm only talking of myself

01:22:38.272 --> 01:22:41.112
You must add what other doctors say

01:22:43.352 --> 01:22:46.752
Shall we say about 500 in all?

01:22:46.912 --> 01:22:48.712
Yes, certainly

01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:53.992
In the last fortnight, 15000
have consumed the holy water...

01:22:54.432 --> 01:22:57.352
and 500 have fallen ill!

01:22:58.072 --> 01:23:03.792
Do you still believe that drinking
holy water causes these ailments

01:23:10.872 --> 01:23:12.912
We don't believe Dr. Gupta!

01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:15.192
Don't speak rubbish, Dr.
Gupta. - We will not accept it.

01:23:24.872 --> 01:23:26.112
Run. Come on. Come on, run. - Run. Run.

01:23:27.192 --> 01:23:31.472
Dr. Gupta, let's get
away There's a back door!

01:23:33.192 --> 01:23:37.032
Come on. Come on.

01:23:45.752 --> 01:23:49.352
Down with Dr. Gupta. -
Down with Dr. Gupta.

01:23:58.792 --> 01:24:05.312
Dr. Ashok Gupta is a Public Enemy

01:24:27.032 --> 01:24:29.512
You can't get out at all!

01:24:30.552 --> 01:24:32.752
How can we stay like this

01:24:34.392 --> 01:24:35.632
Run away?

01:24:36.152 --> 01:24:37.432
What else?

01:24:39.072 --> 01:24:40.152
No!

01:24:41.912 --> 01:24:44.192
What about the poisonous water?

01:24:46.352 --> 01:24:48.152
And my patients?

01:24:49.552 --> 01:24:52.072
In this darkest hour....

01:24:53.952 --> 01:24:55.512
Shall I run away?

01:24:56.272 --> 01:24:59.032
The people won't let you stay here

01:24:59.672 --> 01:25:02.872
I can see that, Maya!

01:25:04.352 --> 01:25:06.232
I haven't done any wrong

01:25:07.752 --> 01:25:09.112
Why must this happen?

01:25:10.392 --> 01:25:14.912
Won't the people realize
what a mistake they are making?

01:25:16.272 --> 01:25:17.552
May I come in?

01:25:19.352 --> 01:25:20.592
Come in

01:25:21.832 --> 01:25:22.792
Sit down.

01:25:24.672 --> 01:25:27.472
I'm sorry this is
happening to your house

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.112
What can you do?

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.512
This is the work of hired hoodlums!

01:25:33.072 --> 01:25:33.752
I know.

01:25:34.952 --> 01:25:36.072
Tell me...

01:25:38.112 --> 01:25:42.352
It's not my task doctor, but...

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.552
I will make it easy for you

01:25:47.672 --> 01:25:51.872
You want me to leave, right?

01:25:52.552 --> 01:25:54.712
I'd never say so myself

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:56.472
You know me.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.392
You've been my tenant
for the last 5 years...

01:25:59.712 --> 01:26:01.792
...to be honest

01:26:02.672 --> 01:26:05.152
I hesitate to say `tenant'

01:26:05.432 --> 01:26:09.432
Our relationship
doesn't call for such a term!

01:26:10.112 --> 01:26:12.952
There has never been
any friction between us

01:26:14.352 --> 01:26:18.072
You cured my daughter of her illness...

01:26:19.032 --> 01:26:21.872
...I'm grateful to you for it, but...

01:26:24.432 --> 01:26:25.552
Go on

01:26:26.072 --> 01:26:28.792
The neighbours have pressurised me...

01:26:29.112 --> 01:26:31.232
They don't want you here

01:26:31.672 --> 01:26:33.512
I speak for that

01:26:34.912 --> 01:26:36.712
I'm helpless, doctor

01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:40.072
I wouldn't say anything to defend you

01:26:42.312 --> 01:26:43.272
Is that it?

01:26:43.512 --> 01:26:44.592
Yes

01:26:46.512 --> 01:26:47.912
All right

01:26:49.032 --> 01:26:51.392
Let me see which way to turn...

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:55.032
...then I'll decide what to do

01:26:56.672 --> 01:26:58.392
Don't hold it against me

01:26:58.792 --> 01:27:03.032
I was left with no choice but to come

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:06.912
My feelings towards you
have not changed at all...

01:27:07.232 --> 01:27:08.872
...whatever people say!

01:27:09.512 --> 01:27:11.472
I sympathies with you

01:27:12.192 --> 01:27:13.472
May I leave?

01:27:14.512 --> 01:27:16.512
Yes. - Okay, greetings.

01:27:23.632 --> 01:27:27.232
How come you're back so early?

01:27:27.312 --> 01:27:29.272
I'll tell you

01:27:30.672 --> 01:27:32.912
She has been asked to quit

01:27:34.032 --> 01:27:34.832
Because she is a
daughter of Ashok Gupta.

01:27:35.672 --> 01:27:38.672
Isn't it?

01:27:39.832 --> 01:27:40.552
Yes.

01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:43.912
Lost your job?

01:27:46.432 --> 01:27:51.352
5 parents have written
that I shouldn't teach anymore

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:55.352
Kamaladi told me

01:27:55.712 --> 01:27:57.232
Who liked you so much?

01:27:57.912 --> 01:27:59.832
She felt very unhappy

01:28:00.432 --> 01:28:01.592
What else could she do?

01:28:02.792 --> 01:28:05.632
The committees make the decisions

01:28:07.232 --> 01:28:09.352
My job wasn't confirmed yet

01:28:20.992 --> 01:28:21.592
Hello.

01:28:22.192 --> 01:28:25.032
This is Nishit -Good morning !

01:28:26.632 --> 01:28:28.712
I presume I'm no longer in the hospital?

01:28:29.312 --> 01:28:30.912
The committee has suspended you...

01:28:30.952 --> 01:28:32.592
...and is serving a show cause notice

01:28:33.032 --> 01:28:36.032
If you can't answer
satisfactorily you'll be dismissed

01:28:37.032 --> 01:28:38.152
Thanks!

01:28:38.392 --> 01:28:40.512
There's one thing -What?

01:28:41.112 --> 01:28:44.232
If you admit your fault,
you won't lose your job!

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:50.112
You know very well, that
is the last thing I will do

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:52.752
Then let things stand

01:28:53.032 --> 01:28:54.032
Very well

01:29:01.592 --> 01:29:02.672
What's this?

01:29:03.352 --> 01:29:04.592
We have a proposition...

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:06.672
...which could turn you
in the public's favour!

01:29:07.232 --> 01:29:08.032
Get out!

01:29:09.952 --> 01:29:11.672
At once!

01:29:12.512 --> 01:29:14.472
Or I'll have you thrown out

01:29:43.032 --> 01:29:44.072
What is it?

01:29:52.792 --> 01:29:54.232
I have lost!

01:30:01.272 --> 01:30:03.152
No more fight left in me!

01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:10.952
Did Nishit call?

01:30:15.232 --> 01:30:16.712
Your job?

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:28.472
Chandan?

01:30:29.432 --> 01:30:30.152
Yes.

01:30:31.912 --> 01:30:34.592
Say I can't meet him now!

01:30:35.152 --> 01:30:37.352
Ronen was to come!

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.832
He has something to tell you

01:30:40.992 --> 01:30:41.712
I see.

01:30:43.152 --> 01:30:44.752
If it's Ronen, let him in

01:31:00.952 --> 01:31:02.552
Because of this wretch...

01:31:04.072 --> 01:31:06.112
...you lost everything !

01:31:08.792 --> 01:31:11.152
I don't know how to console you

01:31:13.672 --> 01:31:16.072
Why do you take it so much to heart?

01:31:16.312 --> 01:31:18.312
You have your private practice

01:31:18.672 --> 01:31:21.232
There's no better doctor
than you in this town!

01:31:22.552 --> 01:31:25.512
If need be, I can always private lesson

01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:27.152
Surely that will see us through

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:28.232
What's this?

01:31:29.152 --> 01:31:30.592
Are you ill?

01:31:32.352 --> 01:31:34.992
The way my world is crumbling...

01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:38.472
...how can I not be ill?

01:31:40.152 --> 01:31:42.512
Biresh had phoned me

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:47.512
He had something to say to you

01:31:48.632 --> 01:31:50.232
He hesitated to come alone

01:31:51.352 --> 01:31:54.392
Your editor was here a while ago

01:31:55.992 --> 01:31:57.552
I sent him away

01:32:00.232 --> 01:32:01.952
Not my editor, doctor...

01:32:03.112 --> 01:32:04.472
...I'm no longer with Janavarta

01:32:05.712 --> 01:32:06.672
What?

01:32:07.192 --> 01:32:07.792
Yes.

01:32:08.752 --> 01:32:10.912
I'm on my own. Independent!

01:32:11.872 --> 01:32:12.912
Really?

01:32:13.352 --> 01:32:16.112
Sir let's hear about it

01:32:23.232 --> 01:32:27.312
The way Janavarta behaved with you...

01:32:28.592 --> 01:32:30.912
I couldn't tolerate it!

01:32:31.832 --> 01:32:35.232
And last night's meeting was a farce!

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:40.872
I want to send a report of the
meeting to all Calcutta papers

01:32:41.872 --> 01:32:47.352
Along with a candidate to be interviewed

01:32:49.072 --> 01:32:52.032
But that's....admirable!

01:32:52.272 --> 01:32:53.792
It's just what I want!

01:32:53.992 --> 01:32:56.312
To let people know my view and judge!

01:32:56.392 --> 01:32:58.552
Please get some tea

01:33:00.592 --> 01:33:02.552
I am most willing to
give an interview....

01:33:02.832 --> 01:33:06.472
Call it the
Confessions of a Public Enemy!

01:33:07.592 --> 01:33:08.832
See what is scrawled outside?

01:33:09.112 --> 01:33:13.792
Before the interview starts,
may I speak to you?

01:33:15.392 --> 01:33:17.352
If you could just go
through these proofs

01:33:19.472 --> 01:33:20.552
What proofs?

01:33:20.632 --> 01:33:23.472
The article you wrote
which Janavarta turned down

01:33:24.512 --> 01:33:26.792
Ranu had a copy
- gave it to me

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.832
We're publishing it as a pamphlet!

01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:30.472
Distribute it door to door!

01:33:32.352 --> 01:33:33.072
I see.

01:33:34.432 --> 01:33:37.912
So ... there is hope? -Certainly!

01:33:38.392 --> 01:33:40.432
There'll be pure water in
the temple again, you'll see

01:33:40.792 --> 01:33:43.992
We'll campaign for you, till
people come to their senses

01:33:44.832 --> 01:33:48.552
I thought ... the ground
had slipped under my feet!

01:33:49.832 --> 01:33:51.792
The thought of leaving this house

01:33:52.552 --> 01:33:54.792
Ranu has no job, I....

01:33:55.912 --> 01:34:01.672
Long live Dr.Gupta

01:34:01.752 --> 01:34:07.952
Long live Dr.Gupta

01:34:08.032 --> 01:34:13.192
Long live Dr.Gupta

01:34:13.272 --> 01:34:14.472
Who are they?

01:34:14.952 --> 01:34:15.952
They're coming to you

01:34:16.032 --> 01:34:18.192
Long live, Dr. Gupta!

01:34:18.272 --> 01:34:19.392
Who are they?

01:34:19.672 --> 01:34:23.392
My theatre group, and
other educated boys and girls

01:34:23.872 --> 01:34:27.872
They met last night, and are
coming to tell you today...

01:34:27.952 --> 01:34:29.272
...that they are behind you!

01:34:29.352 --> 01:34:30.832
Hail Dr. Gupta. - Hail.

01:34:30.912 --> 01:34:32.472
This is unbelievable!

01:34:33.752 --> 01:34:35.352
Long live, Ashok Gupta!

01:34:35.432 --> 01:34:40.712
Long live Dr. Gupta

01:34:40.792 --> 01:34:42.472
Long live Dr.Gupta

01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:45.872
Long live Dr. Gupta
- Who are they?

01:34:45.952 --> 01:34:50.752
I'm not alone!
- Long live Dr. Gupta

01:34:51.872 --> 01:34:54.072
I may be a public enemy,

01:34:54.472 --> 01:34:56.352
but I have a lot of friends.

01:34:56.792 --> 01:35:00.072
We'll stay here, our work is here!

01:35:00.152 --> 01:35:03.472
Long live Dr. Gupta

01:35:03.552 --> 01:35:06.552
Long live Dr. Gupta

01:35:06.632 --> 01:35:09.912
Long live Dr. Gupta
