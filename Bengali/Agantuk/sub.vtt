WEBVTT

00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:36.123
Who is it from?

00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:38.563
I can't guess from
the handwriting.

00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:41.003
M. Mitra

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:44.403
Must be someone on your
mother's side.

00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:47.451
I don't know of any
M. Mitra.

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.203
They say, there'll be no power
cuts during the holidays.

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:09.283
Well? Who's it from?

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.283
Whose letter is it, Mummy?

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:26.003
- Just a moment.

00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:29.819
Ok. Like a massive...

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:34.043
Well?

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.003
Is it some bad news?

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:45.803
I don't know.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.163
Don't know?

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:51.723
Who's that from, Mummy?

00:01:53.803 --> 00:01:55.283
Your great uncle!

00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:58.588
The one who ran away
from home?

00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:00.323
But he's been missing
for ages!

00:02:01.803 --> 00:02:05.239
35 years! He left in 1955.

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:08.083
I was only two then.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.923
And your uncle?

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.763
He left immediately
after graduation.

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.763
I don't remember him at all.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:20.883
Later, my mother told me
everything.

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:25.763
Last time we heard from him
was in 1968.

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:29.763
He never wrote to any of his
relatives.

00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:34.324
Only to Mr. Sital. A post
cover every 6 months or so.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.003
From various places in Europe.

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:41.083
It was not possible to reply
because he gave no address.

00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:45.003
This Sital was a family friend,
wasn't he?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.172
Yes.
He was grandpa's neighbour.

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.923
He has been to see us also.

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:56.403
Oh yes. He was in the
Governor's accounts department.

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.723
He has retired and is living in
Shanti Niketan, isn't it?

00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:02.403
It was from him that
uncle learnt about us.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:03.763
Where has he written from?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.923
New Delhi.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.163
Qutub Hotel.

00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.643
Any way, just read me
the letter, will you?

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:26.403
I must say his command of
Bengali is admirable.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.142
My dear Baby.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.403
Baby? Who is baby?

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.923
Let me read it, will you?

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.861
My dear Baby.

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.812
I don't know your real name.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.243
Oh! I'm addressing you
in this fashion.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.923
I hope you won't mind.

00:03:45.694 --> 00:03:47.323
That's very florid style.

00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:52.403
When I left home, you were
no more than a baby.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.217
I have finished my travels
in the West...

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:57.403
... and have only just
arrived here.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:01.303
... learnt from
Mr. Sital that...

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:04.923
... you're my only
close relation left...

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.923
... and are settled happily.
Your husband and son ...

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:14.403
I shall soon resume
my wanderings.

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:18.232
In the meantime,
I dearly wish...

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.915
to spend a week as the
guest of my niece...

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.523
... in the city of
my birth.

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:26.810
Won't know this uncle
of yours by sight...

00:04:26.887 --> 00:04:28.683
... as I won't know you.

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.363
I realize that in the
instances my request...

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.923
... amounts to an
imposition.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.923
In our country,
in the old days, ...

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.817
...hospitality was
extended even...

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:43.923
... to total strangers.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.829
It is the thought
of this tradition...

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:50.243
... that gives me the courage
to make this request.

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:51.918
I have decided.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:55.403
We leave by the Rajdhani
Express on the 16th ...

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.403
... and arrive in Calcutta
on the 17th morning.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.516
I shall then turn up at
your house in a taxi.

00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:04.923
It is certainly up to you
to accept me...

00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:08.403
...as a guest or not.

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:09.870
Let me assure you.

00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:15.403
I'm used to experiences
both bitter and sweet.

00:05:15.838 --> 00:05:17.341
Yours affectionately, ...

00:05:17.418 --> 00:05:20.283
Uncle Manmohan Mitra.

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.923
You have no memories
of your uncle.

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:27.923
You even recall whether he is
stout or thin or tall or short.

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:30.403
No.

00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:35.923
So there is only one thing.
Send an immediate reply...

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.483
... by telegram,
A letter won't do.

00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:54.063
Tell him a bare faced lie?

00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:56.222
What do you mean a lie?

00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:58.243
That people go on holidays...?

00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:00.403
... doesn't know
I'm an executive...

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.403
... as if I were a professor?

00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:04.633
We are enjoying a long holiday
on autumn, wouldn't I?

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.592
That you're not professor.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.403
How can you be sure that
this man isn't lying?

00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:11.683
You know how common fraud
is these days?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.323
There's a priceless art collection...

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.826
... in that sitting room alone.
Subjects worth a million rupees.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.123
Take just one bronze
figurine...

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:24.657
.... from the top
of the book shelf...

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:25.923
... and you can make
a fortune...

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.323
... by selling it to a
foreign tourist.

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:31.403
You mean he is coming
to commit a theft

00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:38.643
Uncle was a great
favourite of my mother.

00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:40.923
Dad too was very fond on him.

00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:43.447
Did not without reason.

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:45.058
Uncle was very gifted.

00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:47.403
Never stood second in his life.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:55.619
Here a person can change
beyond recognition.

00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:58.123
It doesn't seem so
from the letter.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:03.639
I'll assume that he is
indeed your uncle...

00:07:04.013 --> 00:07:05.603
... and a model of virtue.

00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:08.563
Won't you give your husband
a little thought?

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:10.923
What do you mean?

00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:19.403
Says he's coming on
the 17th, Friday.

00:07:20.078 --> 00:07:21.756
That he'll stay for a week.

00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:24.683
Means, the whole weekend
would be ruined.

00:07:25.203 --> 00:07:27.403
The autumn festival
starts on 21st.

00:07:28.403 --> 00:07:30.365
I thought I'd relax
during the holidays.

00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:32.225
Now comes this old man...

00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:33.803
...claiming to be your uncle.

00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:43.923
Come in dear sir. Sit down in.
Have a meal dear, sir.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:46.264
Don't like it at all.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.483
What?

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:49.243
Your attitude, what else?

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:51.403
You can't send this telegram
in answer to this letter.

00:07:51.563 --> 00:07:54.403
As a thoroughly decent letter!
- I don't deny that.

00:07:55.547 --> 00:07:59.923
In fact, its a little too
decent. - That's the trouble.

00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:01.865
How can a man who's been
away from home so long...

00:08:01.942 --> 00:08:03.923
... write such elegant Bengali?

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:09.196
May be he got someone else
to write for him.

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:10.923
But the sentiment is
surely his own.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.403
No. There's a snag in it.

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:19.563
Very well.

00:08:24.923 --> 00:08:26.843
Is grand uncle coming, mummy?

00:08:28.832 --> 00:08:30.203
Ask Daddy.

00:08:35.158 --> 00:08:36.123
What is it now?

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:40.963
Are you cross with me
or something?

00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:57.110
A fake uncle is better than
no uncle.

00:08:57.187 --> 00:09:00.923
Is that what you wish to say?
- Wish to say only one thing.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.923
What's the need for a
letter or a telegram?

00:09:04.123 --> 00:09:06.243
He says he is coming here
on the 17th.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.140
Let him come.

00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:08.577
If I find him a fake...

00:09:08.653 --> 00:09:10.354
... or is real, but has come
with an ulterior motive, ...

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.683
... then you won't have
to do anything.

00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:14.923
I'll myself whisk him
away with a broom.

00:09:19.105 --> 00:09:22.923
Just think - a fake
great uncle!

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.363

00:12:17.163 --> 00:12:19.763
Sweep well under the cupboard.
There's a lot of dust there.

00:12:20.243 --> 00:12:22.203
Madhu, when you've done
the bed...

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.243
... bring a flask of cold
and put it on the table.

00:12:40.523 --> 00:12:43.163
You stay there and call,
but when he comes...

00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:34.394
Mummy!

00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:43.243
Come down for the luggage,
You there.

00:13:59.843 --> 00:14:01.763
What is your name?

00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:04.243
Satyaki

00:14:04.557 --> 00:14:09.439
Lord Krishna's pupil
or Sudhindra Bose's son?

00:14:16.081 --> 00:14:18.163
Your name?
- Anila.

00:14:21.462 --> 00:14:23.763
Did you get my letter?
- Oh, yes.

00:14:24.742 --> 00:14:26.243
I didn't get a reply.

00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:28.327
I hope you didn't write
asking me not to come.

00:14:28.404 --> 00:14:29.275
No, no.

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:40.243
You think I don't know
I've put you in a spot?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.763
Asking you to accept someone
you've hardly seen...

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.158
... as your uncle...

00:14:45.482 --> 00:14:46.763
Why do you say that?

00:14:46.963 --> 00:14:49.403
It's good to find back a thing
one had taken for lost

00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:52.672
I presume your
husband is...

00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:55.243
...in the office - There's no
work tomorrow and day after ...

00:14:55.778 --> 00:14:57.763
... and the Durga festival
starts on the 21st.

00:14:58.161 --> 00:14:59.163
I see.

00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:02.203
Can I get you a
cold drink?

00:15:02.453 --> 00:15:04.523
A little rest and then
you can have your bath.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.923
Very well, but no
ice please.

00:15:23.043 --> 00:15:26.363
Half a mind to buy some
sweets for you and the boy.

00:15:26.523 --> 00:15:29.523
Then I realized I didn't
know where to go for these...

00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:32.523
... would probably end up
buying inferior stuff.

00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:46.043
The old confectioners Ganguram...
still there?

00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:48.683
Oh yes, there are many
new ones.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.523
Why this tastes a lot
like Coca Cola?

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:54.043
Is this made here?
- Yes.

00:15:56.184 --> 00:16:00.523
Good Lord! - This isn't how you
spell Thumbs up, Satyaki?

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.665
Oh, no.

00:16:04.843 --> 00:16:06.203
That's better.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.363
You go to school, I suppose?

00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:13.243
Yes, now we have a month's
holiday for festivals.

00:16:13.778 --> 00:16:16.043
On the way, I saw some houses
with decorations...

00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:19.043
... which suggested I'd come
during the festival.

00:16:19.243 --> 00:16:20.573
Have you watched a Durga festival
in all these years...

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.043
you've been away?
- No.

00:16:23.363 --> 00:16:25.043
But I've seen
Lord Krishna's Chariot.

00:16:25.243 --> 00:16:26.848
D'you know where?

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:29.243
Madison Avenue in New York

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:32.054
It's the same here.

00:16:32.131 --> 00:16:34.523
Swarming with white skinned
followers of Krishna.

00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:37.443
They are the men that
ring out the Chariot, not we

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:43.163
Do you know the 108 names
of Lord Krishna?

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:44.843
No.

00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:06.963
My grandma used to sing it.

00:17:07.123 --> 00:17:08.686
I'll teach you.

00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:13.043
You'll have a bath,
won't you?

00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:17.638
If it isn't too much
trouble.

00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:20.523
Not at all. Your room's
upstairs.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.243
Satyaki will show you.

00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:24.384
You have a lovely house.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:26.022
My father-in-law built it.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.043
And your husband
has inherited it?

00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:29.803
Come, Satyaki

00:17:37.127 --> 00:17:39.669
By the way, I know nothing
about your taste in food

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:43.723
Dear, I'm Omnivorous
and a small eater.

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:45.683
So, you have nothing
to worry about.

00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:56.963
Has he come?
- Yes, just 10 minutes ago.

00:17:59.201 --> 00:18:01.763
What shall I say?
Seems a jovial person.

00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:04.683
He uses endearing terms when
talking to me. I quite like it!

00:18:05.107 --> 00:18:08.123
But you haven't addressed
as dear uncle, already?

00:18:10.295 --> 00:18:11.603
I'm not so gullible.

00:18:12.433 --> 00:18:15.266
Goodness! Does he
resemble your mother?

00:18:16.314 --> 00:18:18.123
No, but one thing he
shares with her.

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.123
What?
- A singing voice.

00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:24.306
He's already been singing
for you?

00:18:25.323 --> 00:18:27.980
Oh, no. Just a couple
of lines.

00:18:29.423 --> 00:18:30.323
How's his Bengali?

00:18:31.115 --> 00:18:32.523
Better than yours or mine.

00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:37.483
What? I find that
very suspicious.

00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:39.683
Listen.
- What now?

00:18:40.506 --> 00:18:41.963
Ask to see his passport.

00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:46.495
There's no sound proof
of identity than that.

00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:49.283
Are you out of your mind?
You think a woman can do that?

00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:51.123
You do that when you meet him.

00:18:51.323 --> 00:18:52.963
I can't be bothered.
I'm hanging up.

00:19:14.363 --> 00:19:15.683
We've come.

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:19.188
Kurta Pyjama. I hope
this dress will do.

00:19:19.265 --> 00:19:20.483
Certainly!

00:19:20.883 --> 00:19:22.883
I had nothing that
I could wear here.

00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.883
So I bought these
in Delhi.

00:19:25.249 --> 00:19:26.563
Come in.

00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:34.283
That's fish.

00:19:35.068 --> 00:19:36.363
Sit down, please.

00:19:39.683 --> 00:19:42.683
Since you're omnivorous,
you mustn't skip any items.

00:19:43.363 --> 00:19:47.363
But I also said 'small eater,'
remember?

00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:53.363
I suggest you put aside
the meat for dinner.

00:19:53.883 --> 00:19:55.683
I'll have the fish now.

00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:06.122
Do you know what this is?

00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:08.283
I told you how long I
don't taste Bengali dishes.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.817
You wouldn't believe me.

00:20:10.014 --> 00:20:11.134
This is curried spinach.

00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:14.963
You know Popeye the sailor,
Satyaki?

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.883
Oh yes, it's spinach that
gives him strength.

00:20:25.003 --> 00:20:26.883
Here's something new.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:30.363
Good Lord! What are these?
- Fancy crisps.

00:20:30.523 --> 00:20:32.883
The women of Midnapore
prepare them at home.

00:20:36.158 --> 00:20:38.753
Edible embroideries.
This could only happen in Bengal.

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:40.683
Give me one, mummy.

00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:45.717
Won't you join us, dear?

00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:47.565
I'll eat,
when you've finished.

00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:49.883
That means, you haven't
become a Memsahib yet.

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.797
You say you haven't tasted
Bengali cooking all these years.

00:21:00.994 --> 00:21:02.883
But there are any number of
Bengalis in the West.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.203
In New York alone,
we know so many of them.

00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:07.363
Haven't you had anything
to do with them?

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.363
Once I've broken free
of my moorings...

00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:13.883
...why hobnob with Bengalis
anymore?

00:21:15.244 --> 00:21:16.987
But you haven't forgotten
the language.

00:21:17.064 --> 00:21:19.083
You speak it well,
write it well.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.643
I'll take lentil first
then fish.

00:21:21.805 --> 00:21:23.243
So do we.

00:21:24.612 --> 00:21:25.883
You know what, dear?

00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:30.363
Unless you wish to forget your
mother tongue, you don't forget it.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.883
But if you do, you can
do so in 3 months.

00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:37.363
And for that you didn't have
to leave the country.

00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:41.363
In Delhi, I find children
addressing their parents...

00:21:42.283 --> 00:21:45.363
... as Mummy and Daddy.

00:21:46.083 --> 00:21:48.363
Do you do the same, Satyaki?

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:49.883
- Certainly not!

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.203
The crisps are eaten
with lentil.

00:21:52.474 --> 00:21:55.883
Shall I give you one?
- Very well. Fancy Crisps

00:22:09.689 --> 00:22:11.883
Why did you leave home?

00:22:13.363 --> 00:22:16.794
Mother told me
everyone loved you.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.363
And you were a fine student
with a bright future.

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:23.363
But yet why I left home?
- Yes.

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:28.363
There's a lovely word in
German, 'Wanderlust'.

00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:31.883
It means the irrepressible
urge to travel.

00:22:32.363 --> 00:22:34.283
Is that the only reason?

00:22:34.443 --> 00:22:36.323
It's true that I've always
felt that urge.

00:22:36.633 --> 00:22:38.283
But there was another reason.

00:22:39.248 --> 00:22:40.371
Will you take the fish now?

00:22:41.608 --> 00:22:43.283
I'd rather have the mutton.

00:22:43.645 --> 00:22:45.883
Fish bones will hamper
my speech.

00:22:56.365 --> 00:22:57.883
Enough. Enough.

00:23:03.523 --> 00:23:05.523
You haven't said
what the other reason was.

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:11.081
So you are listening to me,
are you?

00:23:11.883 --> 00:23:14.363
I'll tell you.
It'll amuse you!

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:17.610
I used to draw very well
as a small boy

00:23:17.743 --> 00:23:19.690
Yes, mother used
to say so.

00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:23.363
I had decided to join
an art school...

00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:26.363
... after finishing
my studies.

00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:29.883
One day, in my first year
at college...

00:23:31.505 --> 00:23:34.643
... a foreign journal fell
into my hands.

00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:39.883
I opened it and found a
full page picture of a bison.

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.883
Not a photo,
but a painting.

00:23:43.642 --> 00:23:44.883
You know what a bison is?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.130
Yes, they have horns
on their heads.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.176
Yes, this bison was
charging...

00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:49.445
...with head bent and
horns sticking out.

00:23:50.883 --> 00:23:53.883
You know, dear? It was an
extraordinary painting.

00:23:54.883 --> 00:23:58.363
Such poise!
Such a bold stance!

00:23:59.514 --> 00:24:01.643
As if it was painted
by Da Vinci.

00:24:01.959 --> 00:24:03.363
Who was this painter?

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:05.883
Who was that
unique draughtsman?

00:24:06.548 --> 00:24:08.363
Then I read the caption
underneath.

00:24:08.523 --> 00:24:10.883
It said the bison was painted
2000 years ago...

00:24:11.043 --> 00:24:12.363
...in the stone age...

00:24:12.523 --> 00:24:14.363
... in a place called
Altamita Spain ...

00:24:14.523 --> 00:24:16.883
... by a cave dwelling
primitive man.

00:24:18.003 --> 00:24:21.363
I found it so astonishing
that I said to myself...

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.883
...Salutes to you Mr. Bison.

00:24:24.275 --> 00:24:27.880
Whatever else I may become,
I shall never become a painter.

00:24:28.565 --> 00:24:30.363
Because there is no art
school in the world...

00:24:31.096 --> 00:24:33.203
... where you can learn
to draw a bison like this.

00:24:34.523 --> 00:24:39.883
This gave me the urge
to explore the question ...

00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:44.363
... of savagery
and civilization.

00:24:45.363 --> 00:24:47.883
And to this was added
wanderlust.

00:24:48.594 --> 00:24:50.883
The two together made me
leave home.

00:25:02.642 --> 00:25:04.335
You've said you were planning
to set off again.

00:25:04.661 --> 00:25:07.123
This visit to Australia.

00:25:07.283 --> 00:25:08.215
I haven't been to
that part at all.

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:14.883
This is Greek coin, a Drachma

00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:18.583
This is Polish - Zloty.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.047
This is Mexican - Peseta.

00:25:28.763 --> 00:25:31.683
This is a Sol - from Peru

00:25:33.683 --> 00:25:36.803
Anish's uncle also collects coins,
I know what they're called.

00:25:36.879 --> 00:25:37.697
What ?

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:45.363
I don't collect coins.

00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:48.683
It's not my hobby.

00:25:50.051 --> 00:25:51.683
These were lying with me.

00:25:52.647 --> 00:25:56.883
And now they belong to you.
- To me, really?!

00:25:57.218 --> 00:25:58.739
You can show these
to your friends.

00:25:58.815 --> 00:26:01.283
I've already told
my friends.

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:04.883
Some of them, not all.
- What?

00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:07.403
That we have now a guest
in our house, ...

00:26:07.883 --> 00:26:11.837
... who may or may not be
my great uncle.

00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:15.083
They're going to see you
in a little while.

00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:22.363
Come along now.
Don't you want him to rest ?

00:26:22.733 --> 00:26:23.883
I'm going.

00:26:25.553 --> 00:26:26.563
What?

00:26:29.883 --> 00:26:32.883
A German word.
It means, we'll meet again.

00:26:39.883 --> 00:26:45.883
Just think - Andes, the highest
mountain in South America.

00:26:47.487 --> 00:26:51.363
On this mountain, at a height
of 8000 feet ...

00:26:51.938 --> 00:26:53.883
... a city built of stone.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.660
For 4000 years the city
had laid hidden ...

00:26:58.044 --> 00:26:59.363
... from human eyes,

00:27:00.297 --> 00:27:02.883
Then, in 1911, ...

00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:05.363
... the year Mohun Bagan beat
the British football team ...

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:07.363
... and won the IFA shield,...

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.363
... that very year an explorer
called Hiran Bingham,...

00:27:13.487 --> 00:27:17.883
... suddenly chanced upon
this city.

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:21.643
What name did I say ?
- Machu Pichhu

00:27:25.883 --> 00:27:26.898
Here you are.

00:27:30.513 --> 00:27:32.712
Have you been to this city?

00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:35.883
Of course, the picture
is taken by me.

00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:40.883
I went twenty years ago
on mule back.

00:27:41.772 --> 00:27:43.363
I was struck dumb.

00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:46.363
Everything there is
made of stone.

00:27:46.883 --> 00:27:49.363
Yet there are no stones
for miles around

00:27:49.883 --> 00:27:51.643
Where they found the stone ...

00:27:51.883 --> 00:27:54.883
... and how they carried it
up to the hill side, ...

00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:56.563
... nobody knows.

00:27:57.015 --> 00:27:59.403
It was truly wonderful,
the Inca Civilization.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.363
Tell us another story!
- No, not a story.

00:28:03.774 --> 00:28:05.883
This time I'll show you
a trick.

00:28:13.159 --> 00:28:15.363
I'll ask you a few questions.

00:28:16.355 --> 00:28:18.363
Let's see if you can
answer them correctly.

00:28:21.643 --> 00:28:25.883
Tell me, "Which is large,
Moon or Sun?"

00:28:26.175 --> 00:28:27.283
Sun?

00:28:28.363 --> 00:28:29.883
How do you know?

00:28:30.532 --> 00:28:31.603
Just a moment.

00:28:37.363 --> 00:28:38.883
Suppose this is Moon...

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:40.883
.. and this is Sun.

00:28:42.643 --> 00:28:45.523
In the sky, they look the
same size, don't they?

00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:47.883
That's because the sun is
much further away?

00:28:48.189 --> 00:28:49.043
How much?

00:28:50.017 --> 00:28:51.283
I'll tell you.

00:28:51.658 --> 00:28:54.363
The sun is 95 million
miles away.

00:28:55.363 --> 00:28:57.883
While the moon distance is
only five hundred thousand miles.

00:28:58.706 --> 00:29:00.883
That's why, Sun looks bigger.

00:29:01.363 --> 00:29:07.798
Suppose the moon had been
200000 miles away, ...

00:29:08.083 --> 00:29:10.363
...then it would have
looked bigger.

00:29:12.053 --> 00:29:14.363
Like this. Isn't that so?
- Yes.

00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:18.643
And suppose the moon had been
800000 miles away...

00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:20.860
Then it would have looked
smaller.

00:29:20.937 --> 00:29:23.363
Somewhat like this, isn't it?

00:29:26.363 --> 00:29:27.883
But neither happens.

00:29:28.243 --> 00:29:31.667
The moon is just so far away
that makes it look the ...

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.883
... the same size of Sun.

00:29:37.219 --> 00:29:40.363
That's why, when the Moon
takes it position, ...

00:29:41.253 --> 00:29:43.363
... in front of the Sun
and slowly covers it, ...

00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:47.637
... disc matching disc.

00:29:48.285 --> 00:29:49.523
Solar Eclipse!

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:52.883
Yes, total eclipse
of Sun.

00:29:53.363 --> 00:29:56.323
And when the earth's shadow
falls on the Moon ...

00:29:56.483 --> 00:29:58.283
... then also the two
discs match perfectly.

00:29:58.443 --> 00:29:59.768
Lunar Eclipse!

00:29:59.844 --> 00:30:01.883
Total eclipse of Moon!

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.883
What d'you think
made that possible?

00:30:13.487 --> 00:30:14.363
You don't know.

00:30:15.293 --> 00:30:17.323
Ask the wisest man on earth
and even he will say...

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.843
... he doesn't know.

00:30:19.003 --> 00:30:20.083
Nobody knows.

00:30:20.883 --> 00:30:22.363
It's a mystery!

00:30:22.883 --> 00:30:25.883
I say it's one of the greatest
mysteries of the universe.

00:30:26.883 --> 00:30:28.883
Sun and Moon.

00:30:29.083 --> 00:30:31.123
King of the day!
Queen of the night!

00:30:31.883 --> 00:30:36.363
And the shadow of Earth on Moon,...
all exactly the same size.

00:30:38.052 --> 00:30:39.111
Magic!

00:30:53.203 --> 00:30:54.203
Listen!

00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:55.637
What?

00:30:55.714 --> 00:30:56.883
Come here a moment.

00:31:01.043 --> 00:31:04.043
I'm convinced.
- That he's your uncle?

00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:06.043
Yes, and a very nice man.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.523
So you are gullible,
after all.

00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:13.843
In these few hours, you found out
everything about a man?

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:15.523
Women are capable of that.

00:31:16.043 --> 00:31:18.043
They take people on trust.

00:31:18.853 --> 00:31:20.250
And surely you can tell a lot,...

00:31:20.327 --> 00:31:23.043
... from the way a man acts and
walks and the look in his eyes.

00:31:24.843 --> 00:31:27.243
And there is no doubt that
he has been abroad.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.043
He knows German.

00:31:29.658 --> 00:31:31.523
And he has given my son
some foreign coins.

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:34.043
Foreign coins?

00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:39.523
I suppose you know one can
buy foreign postage stamps.

00:31:40.223 --> 00:31:42.043
There are dealers in
coins too.

00:31:43.043 --> 00:31:47.043
Tell me what coin you want.
I'll get you one tomorrow.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.523
Anyway, I only said
what I felt.

00:31:54.523 --> 00:31:56.443
Has he given any reasons
for leaving home?

00:31:56.603 --> 00:31:58.723
It was in that connection that
he used a German word

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:00.203
Which means an urge to travel.

00:32:03.043 --> 00:32:04.043
Wanderlust?

00:32:04.567 --> 00:32:07.043
Yes, but he pronounced it
differently.

00:32:10.524 --> 00:32:11.043
Yes.

00:32:11.243 --> 00:32:12.900
The word is used in
English too.

00:32:12.977 --> 00:32:15.043
And pronounced in the
English way.

00:32:16.243 --> 00:32:19.043
I studied German at the Goethe
Institute for a couple of months.

00:32:19.284 --> 00:32:21.043
Then lost patience!

00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:24.523
I still have a stock of 5
or so German words.

00:32:26.383 --> 00:32:27.443
What else did he say?

00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:29.643
About what?

00:32:30.793 --> 00:32:32.683
Leaving home, what else?

00:32:32.883 --> 00:32:35.043
He said a lot. I'll take a long
time to tell you everything.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.523
I'm interested to know.

00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:40.043
Bison. Does that mean
anything to you?

00:32:48.757 --> 00:32:51.953
There's a guest in the house.
You are the host.

00:32:52.523 --> 00:32:55.003
Do go and say hello to him.
- Where's he?

00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:56.643
Must be in his room.

00:32:56.803 --> 00:32:58.443
He's been out with
Satyaki's friends.

00:32:58.606 --> 00:32:59.643
Came back a little while ago.

00:33:00.043 --> 00:33:02.523
Come on, get up.

00:33:04.594 --> 00:33:07.044
You'd better see about
the broom.

00:33:07.406 --> 00:33:10.043
Listen.
- What is it now?

00:33:10.203 --> 00:33:13.043
I have one favour to ask of you.
- What?

00:33:13.356 --> 00:33:15.523
Please pay your respects to
him and touch his feet.

00:33:32.453 --> 00:33:33.523
Sudhindra Bose.

00:33:36.348 --> 00:33:38.523
No. no, most certainly not.

00:33:40.209 --> 00:33:46.523
When your mind is free of doubt,
then you can touch my feet.

00:33:48.043 --> 00:33:49.523
Not before then.

00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:55.523
I have said in my letter
a line telling you how ...

00:34:00.243 --> 00:34:02.043
... I know who you are.

00:34:03.285 --> 00:34:06.043
But you don't know who I am.

00:34:08.032 --> 00:34:10.636
Unfortunately, there's no
quick way of finding out.

00:34:10.713 --> 00:34:18.795
If I am the real person
or a fake one,...

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:23.236
... only time will tell you.

00:34:24.126 --> 00:34:27.443
You decide whether you're
prepared to wait.

00:34:28.403 --> 00:34:33.267
But why do you say
there is no quick way to know?

00:34:34.122 --> 00:34:35.683
I feel.

00:34:42.043 --> 00:34:44.324
Well. It actually bears
your name ...

00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:49.523
... and your picture too

00:34:57.203 --> 00:35:00.645
Then it's all right.
Why are you... ?

00:35:01.771 --> 00:35:03.775
What does this prove?

00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:10.018
My identity, you'll say.
I say, not even that.

00:35:12.324 --> 00:35:14.523
In these days of
global corruption, ...

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.523
... do you know how easy it is
to forge a passport?

00:35:24.228 --> 00:35:29.043
Therefore, you have every
right to disbelieve me.

00:35:30.977 --> 00:35:33.523
I can't say that
to your wife.

00:35:34.777 --> 00:35:42.833
She is looking after the guest
in an exemplary fashion.

00:35:44.043 --> 00:35:46.043
And it is a question of
blood relationship.

00:35:47.137 --> 00:35:50.213
It applies to her,
not to you.

00:35:54.437 --> 00:35:56.788
Look there. I haven't opened
my suitcase yet.

00:36:00.647 --> 00:36:02.945
If it comes to that, I can be
out in the street in five minutes.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.523
But why do you say that ...

00:36:07.243 --> 00:36:09.043
... my wife likes you

00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:16.523
Forget it.

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.523
I am curious only about one thing.
- What?

00:36:20.794 --> 00:36:25.523
Why did you decide to come
back after so many years?

00:36:27.043 --> 00:36:29.523
Well, you're free to believe me
or not.

00:36:34.601 --> 00:36:36.720
It wasn't my wish to
come back home.

00:36:38.003 --> 00:36:39.723
I've done my job
in the West.

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:42.803
Now I want to travel East.

00:36:44.146 --> 00:36:46.243
I have to stop in Delhi anyway.

00:36:46.816 --> 00:36:53.013
Till now, I haven't felt any ties
of affection for my relatives.

00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:58.723
Perhaps of the fact that I'm
getting on in years.

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:02.243
That's all right.
You may rest now.

00:37:02.391 --> 00:37:04.043
I'll just go and have
a shower.

00:37:10.723 --> 00:37:13.723
You win for the time being.

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:17.043
Passport?
- It's okay.

00:37:17.855 --> 00:37:22.443
Did he show it to you?
- Yes, almost without my asking.

00:37:23.243 --> 00:37:25.243
Then why say for the time being?

00:37:25.819 --> 00:37:27.243
He must be the real uncle.

00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:31.723
That man can twist me
around his little finger.

00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:35.243
D'you know what he said?
- What?

00:37:35.782 --> 00:37:39.243
He says that passport
proves nothing.

00:37:40.172 --> 00:37:42.723
He says passports are being
forged everyday now.

00:37:44.723 --> 00:37:47.243
Ask to see his passport. - Ask
to see his passport now what?

00:37:47.863 --> 00:37:51.982
How could I know that
your so called uncle...

00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:54.723
... was such a shrewd customer?

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:01.723
What it is,
I don't know yet.

00:38:03.723 --> 00:38:06.243
I think I'll find out...

00:38:07.525 --> 00:38:09.243
... tomorrow evening.

00:38:10.102 --> 00:38:11.163
What do you mean?

00:38:12.759 --> 00:38:16.723
I have asked Pritish to
come tomorrow evening.

00:38:17.269 --> 00:38:19.243
Why him?

00:38:20.996 --> 00:38:23.363
We need someone who can
talk straight.

00:38:24.489 --> 00:38:25.944
You know very well ...

00:38:26.502 --> 00:38:28.363
... that your husband is not
such a man.

00:38:29.285 --> 00:38:34.563
I suffer from a chronic liability
to come out into the open.

00:38:34.963 --> 00:38:36.443
Pritish has no such
complaints.

00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:40.963
I have told him everything
and he is most intrigued.

00:38:42.051 --> 00:38:45.003
He has handled such cases
of impersonation before.

00:38:46.003 --> 00:38:47.683
Is he going to
cross question him?

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.603
He can be very blunt,
this friend of yours.

00:38:51.763 --> 00:38:53.683
What d'you mean?
Cross question?

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.843
The man claims to be your
great uncle.

00:38:58.224 --> 00:39:00.363
That's why, we've taken him
as a guest.

00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:02.843
We have to feed him,
don't we?

00:39:03.363 --> 00:39:06.843
It'll cost us atleast
Rs.5 a day.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.843
And yet we know next to
nothing about the man.

00:39:11.177 --> 00:39:13.843
There are certain essential things
we must know about him.

00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:18.363
Pritish will find out and do it
as decently as possible.

00:39:19.363 --> 00:39:20.744
To me it seems
perfectly feasible.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.363
That a man who had left his
home when his niece was two,...

00:39:23.563 --> 00:39:26.152
... now wants to see her again
after so many years.

00:39:26.229 --> 00:39:28.329
I see nothing wrong
in that.

00:39:29.065 --> 00:39:30.363
Very well.

00:39:30.563 --> 00:39:33.575
If he has come for sentimental reason
then I have nothing to say.

00:39:34.684 --> 00:39:38.484
But if I find your uncle's
up to no good ...

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.963
... and if he turn out not to
be my uncle?

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.203
Well, you know
what to do.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.843
Sweep him away with a broom!

00:40:07.683 --> 00:40:09.203
Chanda here.

00:40:11.138 --> 00:40:12.603
Can't you recognise my voice?

00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:15.963
It sounds so different.

00:40:17.401 --> 00:40:21.203
It's nothing but excitement.
Has he come?

00:40:21.403 --> 00:40:22.883
Yes, he has.

00:40:23.717 --> 00:40:24.946
Of course, it's true.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:27.283
Well, how do you find him?

00:40:27.683 --> 00:40:29.523
He's only arrived today.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:36.430
My husband and I are bursting
with curiosity.

00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:41.203
Ever since you told us, we've been
able to think of nothing else.

00:40:42.003 --> 00:40:43.763
I hope you haven't told
any one else.

00:40:43.936 --> 00:40:47.403
Believe me.
We've been itching to...

00:40:47.563 --> 00:40:49.683
... but we haven't said a word.

00:40:50.203 --> 00:40:51.883
Well, now that you know,
Goodbye then.

00:40:52.245 --> 00:40:54.476
No. no, wait, Mr. husband
wants to talk to you.

00:40:54.553 --> 00:40:56.163
I'm handing him the phone.

00:41:01.113 --> 00:41:04.043
I have a request which
you must keep.

00:41:04.552 --> 00:41:05.643
What is it?

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.243
We'd like to drop in
for just half an hour.

00:41:10.737 --> 00:41:14.163
I see. But what if he finds
out that...

00:41:14.403 --> 00:41:16.523
Listen.
I give you my word.

00:41:16.843 --> 00:41:18.843
He won't find out.

00:41:19.083 --> 00:41:20.843
It'll be just one of your
usual social calls.

00:41:21.321 --> 00:41:24.843
We'll go causally.
Have a casual chat

00:41:25.406 --> 00:41:27.323
And then come away casually.

00:41:28.043 --> 00:41:32.323
All you have to do is tell Sudhin
not to introduce me as an actor

00:41:32.952 --> 00:41:35.843
At least he mustn't know
in the early stages.

00:41:36.209 --> 00:41:37.843
Do you want to come
this evening?

00:41:38.323 --> 00:41:41.003
We've double shows on
weekend, don't you see?

00:41:42.323 --> 00:41:43.921
All right, then come
this evening.

00:41:51.456 --> 00:41:54.323
Listen...

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.618
What's up?

00:41:57.695 --> 00:41:59.077
Ranjan and Chanda are coming
in a little while.

00:41:59.154 --> 00:42:00.706
They say they won't let him
know they've come to see him.

00:42:00.782 --> 00:42:05.658
Jolly Good. Ring up all your
other friends too.

00:42:05.843 --> 00:42:06.838
Don't be silly.
- Why not?

00:42:07.002 --> 00:42:09.437
They can share the responsibility
of entertaining the old man.

00:42:09.514 --> 00:42:10.680
And listen.

00:42:10.757 --> 00:42:12.843
Please introduce him
as my uncle.

00:42:16.625 --> 00:42:17.843
May I come in?

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.843
I hope I'm not intruding?

00:42:24.043 --> 00:42:26.200
Not at all.
Let me introduce you.

00:42:26.582 --> 00:42:28.575
Mr. and Mrs. Rakhit

00:42:29.133 --> 00:42:30.323
Manmohan Mitra.

00:42:38.163 --> 00:42:40.063
I don't think we've...

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.083
You haven't. He is
Anita's maternal uncle.

00:42:42.315 --> 00:42:43.563
Maternal...

00:42:57.219 --> 00:42:59.844
No. I'm making a mistake.

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:01.843
Another friend of ours.

00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:08.323
I think it was
Manju's uncle.

00:43:09.255 --> 00:43:10.843
Manju never had an uncle.

00:43:16.585 --> 00:43:19.283
You have three maternal
uncles, don't you?

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:20.443
No, two.

00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:23.323
Two. The elder one
is dead.

00:43:23.483 --> 00:43:26.002
The younger one left
35 years ago.

00:43:38.294 --> 00:43:40.283
I'm getting all mixed up.

00:43:40.395 --> 00:43:42.323
You mix up things
all the time.

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:49.603
Anila's uncle left home
35 years ago.

00:43:49.932 --> 00:43:51.163
He came back this morning.

00:43:52.323 --> 00:43:53.323
Where from?

00:43:53.784 --> 00:43:54.843
The West.

00:43:59.008 --> 00:44:02.323
But this is sensational.
Another Bhawal Sanyasi!

00:44:03.845 --> 00:44:05.643
Do you know of the
Bhawal Sanyasi great case?

00:44:05.847 --> 00:44:07.843
I do.
- World famous case.

00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:10.843
Do you know how long it went on?
Ten years.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.763
There is no question of
a court case.

00:44:12.923 --> 00:44:14.234
No?
- No.

00:44:14.957 --> 00:44:18.843
You mean the fact that
he's Mrs. Bose's uncle...

00:44:19.054 --> 00:44:20.309
... is undisputed.

00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:24.843
Well, you don't know
the lawyers these days.

00:44:25.452 --> 00:44:29.022
They'd have wrung you dry.

00:44:29.845 --> 00:44:31.283
And you'd find yourself out...

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.323
... on the streets again
with a begging bowl.

00:44:51.083 --> 00:44:54.563
I see these are your famous
home made biscuits.

00:44:55.156 --> 00:44:56.851
Famous?

00:44:58.271 --> 00:44:59.563
Delicious!

00:45:01.094 --> 00:45:05.085
Now that he is back, shouldn't
you announce it to the press?

00:45:05.319 --> 00:45:06.100
I'll not.
I'm not.

00:45:06.239 --> 00:45:09.521
And if I find that a single
journalist has got on to the fact...

00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:12.083
I think you're at the
bottom of it.

00:45:12.238 --> 00:45:15.563
They won't get a
single fact out of me.

00:45:17.443 --> 00:45:21.563
But I could see a headline
before my eyes.

00:45:27.563 --> 00:45:30.563
Do you know that prodigal has
two meanings, Mr. Rakhit?

00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:33.563
Two meanings?

00:45:34.165 --> 00:45:40.442
One is wasteful.
And the other is repentant.

00:45:41.274 --> 00:45:42.883
I'm neither.

00:45:43.563 --> 00:45:46.083
I'm happy to hear this.

00:45:46.934 --> 00:45:50.083
May I ask you something?

00:45:50.621 --> 00:45:51.723
Certainly.

00:45:52.323 --> 00:45:56.718
We didn't know a thing.

00:45:57.787 --> 00:46:00.444
Now that we are here,
you know?

00:46:00.823 --> 00:46:02.323
Are you back here alone?

00:46:03.372 --> 00:46:04.603
There is no one else
to keep me company.

00:46:06.807 --> 00:46:08.563
You mean you never married?

00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:12.563
Wife would mean a family
and a house.

00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:15.723
The whole point is, I didn't wish
to be tied down to a home.

00:46:15.927 --> 00:46:18.083
I see, I get it.

00:46:30.919 --> 00:46:33.563
If you've come back to
Calcutta after ages...

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.906
... did you start your journey
from Calcutta?

00:46:35.983 --> 00:46:37.563
Yes.

00:46:37.726 --> 00:46:40.563
Well, how d'you find the city
after such a long time?

00:46:40.723 --> 00:46:42.563
Mind you, I'm in and out
of Calcutta.

00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:44.740
But I'm used to hearing
the city denounced.

00:46:45.006 --> 00:46:47.563
Why? It's certainly a
civilized city!

00:46:48.563 --> 00:46:51.083
You think so?
- Why not?

00:46:51.482 --> 00:46:54.283
Oh, the people are happier
in the streets.

00:46:54.563 --> 00:46:56.483
The high rises ascending
proudly...

00:46:56.559 --> 00:46:58.563
... and in the midst
of these,...

00:46:59.144 --> 00:47:04.083
... even after 35 years.
I find men pulling rickshaws.

00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:07.563
How can you have a civilization
without these contradictions?

00:47:08.012 --> 00:47:11.083
You seem rather bitter
about civilization?

00:47:11.798 --> 00:47:13.363
What would you say
about a city like New York?

00:47:13.523 --> 00:47:15.403
Why, its colossal?

00:47:15.563 --> 00:47:17.563
Judging from what we
see in the movies,...

00:47:18.918 --> 00:47:24.902
... family after family with
long faces squatting on it, ...

00:47:25.583 --> 00:47:27.003
... while a placard says,...

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.403
... we are homeless.

00:47:32.331 --> 00:47:34.083
Are you coming straight
from New York?

00:47:35.354 --> 00:47:37.083
No. South America.
Brazil.

00:47:39.843 --> 00:47:42.483
Brazil. Great heavens!

00:47:44.563 --> 00:47:45.563
What's the matter?

00:47:46.083 --> 00:47:48.843
He's probably
thinking of Pele.

00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:50.563
Pele?

00:47:51.691 --> 00:47:53.563
You've been in Brazil and
you haven't heard of Pele?

00:47:54.636 --> 00:47:56.363
Oh yes, foot baller,
isn't he?

00:47:56.439 --> 00:47:59.083
He scored a goal
with a back kick.

00:48:00.313 --> 00:48:02.563
Mr. Rakhit my knowledge
of football...

00:48:02.723 --> 00:48:04.513
...is shockingly limited.
I only know about...

00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:07.726
... two Bengal teams,
Mohan Bagan and East Bengal.

00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:19.563
Football and another thing,...

00:48:20.271 --> 00:48:22.483
... something you must have
missed in the West.

00:48:23.237 --> 00:48:24.083
What?

00:48:24.852 --> 00:48:26.563
Something which is the
monopoly of Bengal.

00:48:27.083 --> 00:48:29.083
In fact you may call it
an invention of the Bengalis.

00:48:29.735 --> 00:48:30.483
The sweetmeat "Rasogolla"

00:48:33.354 --> 00:48:34.563
Talk sessions.

00:48:35.254 --> 00:48:41.563
There are simple sessions
on park benches and by the lakes...

00:48:41.963 --> 00:48:43.563
... and in coffee houses.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.563
That which Bengalis
thrive on.

00:48:46.977 --> 00:48:49.083
Talk sessions made in
Bengal.

00:48:54.251 --> 00:48:57.563
D'you know 25 years ago,
in Greece,

00:48:58.574 --> 00:49:00.879
... there were gymnasiums.

00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:03.669
Health gymnasiums,
weren't they?

00:49:04.083 --> 00:49:05.563
Not just looking macho...

00:49:06.385 --> 00:49:08.083
... and juvenile's dictum.

00:49:08.763 --> 00:49:10.563
We learnt it at school.

00:49:11.492 --> 00:49:14.083
Mens Sana in
corpore sano.

00:49:18.675 --> 00:49:21.563
The Greek thus exercise both
the mind and the body.

00:49:22.297 --> 00:49:25.563
And there was a time when both
took place in the gymnasium.

00:49:26.852 --> 00:49:30.563
All these leading much of
Athens.

00:49:32.883 --> 00:49:39.563
Plato, Socrates, Alicibiades
used to come.

00:49:40.302 --> 00:49:42.083
There were discussions...

00:49:43.403 --> 00:49:46.483
... on Philosophy, Politics,
Mathematics...

00:49:46.643 --> 00:49:49.563
... Art, Literature.

00:49:49.818 --> 00:49:52.083
They were known as Dialogue,
You can still read them.

00:49:53.451 --> 00:49:54.683
Now how would you describe
such an activity?

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.483
Why they sound very much
like our talk sessions?

00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:07.970
No gossip no backbiting,
no braggado.

00:50:09.952 --> 00:50:13.083
I don't wish to discuss the talk
sessions that the Bengalis indulge in.

00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:17.083
There must be some examples
of productive discourse.

00:50:18.992 --> 00:50:21.083
But what happens in
most cases?

00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:25.563
At least what happens
in our time...

00:50:26.283 --> 00:50:27.948
... and the norms have gone down
these days,...

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:33.083
... could only be described as
empty twaddle.

00:50:34.443 --> 00:50:36.563
Its discourse was at that
level here.

00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:38.643
Then Tegore would have
joined in them too.

00:50:39.947 --> 00:50:41.083
True enough.

00:50:41.763 --> 00:50:43.523
Tagore may get indulged in
talk sessions.

00:50:43.714 --> 00:50:46.043
Did he, Sudhin?

00:50:46.225 --> 00:50:48.083
Did Tagore ever indulge
in talk sessions?

00:50:49.432 --> 00:50:51.563
I haven't really introduced
him to you.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.083
He is a well known actor.

00:50:55.575 --> 00:50:58.274
Stage, Screen, TV,
everything.

00:51:00.485 --> 00:51:02.563
Won't you call that civilized?

00:51:03.525 --> 00:51:05.563
Do you find material
for comedy here?

00:51:06.182 --> 00:51:08.563
Read nothing but tales of
woe in the paper today.

00:51:09.683 --> 00:51:12.369
I think there's room
for satire.

00:51:12.919 --> 00:51:15.046
As long as our politicians
are there,...

00:51:15.938 --> 00:51:22.083
- ... don't mean anything
as classy as Aris... - Aris?

00:51:23.619 --> 00:51:25.083
Not.

00:51:26.898 --> 00:51:27.786
Sorry?

00:51:27.863 --> 00:51:28.723
Aristophanes?

00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:31.563
Yes. - Well, it's not
quite at that level.

00:51:31.873 --> 00:51:34.563
More like skits.

00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:39.563
For instance, a certain
gentleman.

00:51:40.195 --> 00:51:41.563
I'm giving you an example.

00:51:41.908 --> 00:51:43.483
A Bengali gentleman.

00:51:43.942 --> 00:51:46.243
Actually, someone
from East Bengal.

00:51:46.443 --> 00:51:47.896
Mind you, I'm also
East Bengali

00:51:48.363 --> 00:51:53.189
Really?
Well, so am I.

00:51:53.604 --> 00:51:56.203
So is my wife.

00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:57.403
And you?

00:51:57.662 --> 00:51:58.563
East.

00:51:59.229 --> 00:52:00.403
And you Sudhin?

00:52:01.222 --> 00:52:02.488
West with a vengeance.

00:52:02.883 --> 00:52:04.403
Sorry. You don't count.

00:52:04.563 --> 00:52:05.778
Anyway, this gentleman...

00:52:05.855 --> 00:52:07.563
Stand up, stand up.

00:52:08.393 --> 00:52:10.003
Very well.

00:52:12.058 --> 00:52:15.679
This gentleman has gone
to the Writers Building...

00:52:15.756 --> 00:52:17.883
... to see the
Chief Minister

00:52:18.347 --> 00:52:21.564
He feels that on
certain occasions,...

00:52:21.989 --> 00:52:24.883
... English works are better
than Bengali.

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.404
Well, there he is.
In front of the lift...

00:52:28.631 --> 00:52:29.638
... the police stops him.

00:52:29.804 --> 00:52:31.247
The police asked
where do you want to go?

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.883
The man said I've come
to see C.M.

00:52:34.603 --> 00:52:37.505
CCM? You mean
CPM? (Communist Party Marxist).

00:52:46.054 --> 00:52:47.403
Do you have
an appointment?

00:52:47.603 --> 00:52:52.239
Yes, right now.
4 cm - I mean, pm.

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:57.403
Why sorry?

00:52:59.154 --> 00:53:00.882
What's there to be
sorry about?

00:53:05.718 --> 00:53:08.883
Left so soon?
- Right.

00:53:13.593 --> 00:53:16.883
Well. Mr. Rakhit, can I
ask you something now?

00:53:17.046 --> 00:53:20.288
Certainly.
- How do you find me?

00:53:25.607 --> 00:53:28.205
You've come to see me,
haven't you?

00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:32.941
What's the use of a new paper
... where there's a telephone?

00:53:35.818 --> 00:53:37.844
It must be very hard to keep it
to yourself. Isn't that so, Anila?

00:53:40.095 --> 00:53:41.470
It's full of the stuff
of drama.

00:53:42.565 --> 00:53:46.883
Suspense, suspicion,
conflict...

00:53:51.348 --> 00:53:52.963
I hope you don't mind
my saying so, Mr. Rakhit.

00:53:53.095 --> 00:53:58.883
No, no, in fact, it won't be
easy to keep up the pretense.

00:53:59.637 --> 00:54:02.803
Now that it is no longer
necessary, I feel...

00:54:03.137 --> 00:54:05.495
... much relieved,
is that it?

00:54:50.826 --> 00:54:51.963
What's the matter?

00:54:57.768 --> 00:55:00.643
I can't get it out of my mind.
- What?

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.403
Ranjan's expressions.

00:55:03.628 --> 00:55:06.123
I've never seen him
deflated like that.

00:55:10.091 --> 00:55:15.123
I must say I'm beginning
to like your uncle.

00:55:16.068 --> 00:55:17.728
There's no doubt he's
a learned man.

00:55:17.805 --> 00:55:19.628
One can see he was
a good student.

00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:26.283
What I like most about him
is his sense of humour.

00:55:26.962 --> 00:55:30.043
He knows how to laugh and
how to make people laugh.

00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:38.123
We know next to nothing
about the man.

00:55:40.043 --> 00:55:42.643
What he's been doing
all these years?

00:55:43.643 --> 00:55:46.123
Where he's been? Why?

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:47.643
Nothing.

00:55:54.389 --> 00:55:55.465
Very surprising.

00:55:58.999 --> 00:56:04.123
Listen, your uncle may be
an early riser.

00:56:05.123 --> 00:56:08.370
I'm not going to stir
before nine.

00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:25.640
What's the matter?

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:27.560
What's in your mind?

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.160
Will you please tell me
what's the matter?

00:56:55.265 --> 00:56:58.840
It's wrong to hide anything
from your husband at bed time.

00:56:59.332 --> 00:57:00.720
Do you know that?

00:57:01.792 --> 00:57:03.640
This is not marriage counsel.

00:57:04.346 --> 00:57:06.160
I made it up.

00:57:07.376 --> 00:57:09.160
Now come on,
out with it.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.560
Come on.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.640
Why did it come to my mind
Why? Why? Why?

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.480
What came to your mind?

00:57:21.345 --> 00:57:22.520
What?

00:57:23.867 --> 00:57:25.559
If a man disappears,...

00:57:26.057 --> 00:57:30.920
... how much time is given
before he's taken for dead?

00:57:31.733 --> 00:57:33.160
7 years.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.640
Uncle left in 55.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.160
He sent that card to
Mr. Sital till '68.

00:57:45.912 --> 00:57:48.160
Grandpa died in '70.

00:57:50.675 --> 00:57:52.640
He had made a will.

00:57:54.183 --> 00:57:57.160
My mother got a share.
So did my elder uncle.

00:57:58.418 --> 00:58:01.160
Grandpa was very fond of
my younger uncle.

00:58:01.967 --> 00:58:04.160
Now I see.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.640
This surely calls
for applause!

00:58:14.016 --> 00:58:17.160
Your grandpa must have
provided in his will...

00:58:17.236 --> 00:58:21.104
... for your younger uncle.
Isn't that what you believe?

00:58:21.181 --> 00:58:23.640
Then if he did, how would
uncle know?

00:58:24.031 --> 00:58:26.640
We can think of it later.

00:58:28.287 --> 00:58:32.360
We have to find out now whether
he did make such provision.

00:58:33.061 --> 00:58:34.480
How will you find out?

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.160
Isn't there anyone,
who'll know?

00:58:37.004 --> 00:58:41.320
I don't know.
I can't think of anything else.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.400
Listen.

00:58:42.754 --> 00:58:46.636
That lawyer friend of your grandpa's.
He came to our wedding.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.480
A bit deaf and stinking rich.

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.790
Yet he gave us a book of
verse as present.

00:58:52.956 --> 00:58:54.840
Remember what a laugh
we had over it?

00:58:55.717 --> 00:58:57.640
Tridib Mukherji?
- Right!

00:58:58.311 --> 00:59:00.160
He was 70 or 80
at that time.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.480
What makes you think
he's still alive?

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.113
He may be.

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:06.360
And if he is,
he'd certainly know.

00:59:07.516 --> 00:59:09.322
Why did I have
to think of it?

00:59:09.488 --> 00:59:11.360
Why, why?

00:59:12.094 --> 00:59:15.160
Are you regretting it?
- Yes, I am. Very much so.

00:59:16.089 --> 00:59:18.632
I have no doubt in my mind
any more that he is my uncle...

00:59:18.709 --> 00:59:20.640
... and the only reason
he's come is to see me.

00:59:21.631 --> 00:59:23.640
There can't be
any other reason.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.782
You refer to him
as your uncle.

00:59:25.859 --> 00:59:28.160
But have you ever
addressed him as uncle?

00:59:28.595 --> 00:59:29.840
I haven't heard
you doing so.

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.446
Do you know, why I haven't?
It's because of you.

00:59:32.523 --> 00:59:35.160
You put such doubts
in to my mind.

00:59:35.902 --> 00:59:38.160
I want so much
to call him uncle.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.226
I try to so hard.

00:59:41.303 --> 00:59:43.640
The word comes to the tip
of my tongue, but...

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.320
... good thing
it hasn't come out.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.160
Listen, you must try
to be strong now.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.160
The pill may prove bitter.
And you may have to swallow it.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.160
You must be ready for that.

01:00:04.422 --> 01:00:06.600
You're saying he is here
because of ties of blood.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.640
What if I say he's come
to fill his pockets?

01:00:10.877 --> 01:00:14.160
All these travels cost
a lot these days.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.323
I'm convinced he's come
to claim his share.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.441
That's the only reason.

01:00:19.517 --> 01:00:23.560
How can you be so mean?
So ruthless?

01:00:27.379 --> 01:00:29.160
Who thought of it first?

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:32.640
This is what put it into
my head - crime fiction-

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.160
The thought of a will
wouldn't have struck me at all.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.640
First, we must make sure if
your uncle had a share. Right?

01:00:54.301 --> 01:00:56.600
We must verify that.

01:00:57.901 --> 01:01:00.640
We've to find out the truth,
however bitter it may be.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.831
TC, isn't it?

01:01:05.363 --> 01:01:08.160
Are you out of my mind?
Phoning him at this hour?

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.640
Tell me, TC or TR?

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.640
Address?

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.360
Ballygunge Circular Road.
I don't know the number.

01:01:31.378 --> 01:01:33.160
He hasn't come for his share.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.640
I have no doubt about
this any more.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.320
He's come only to...

01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:48.160
Is this
Mr. Mukherrji's bungalow?

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:52.640
The lawyer, Mr. Mukherji?

01:01:54.894 --> 01:01:56.160
I see.

01:01:56.668 --> 01:02:00.160
But he's alive, isn't he?

01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:04.640
I see, I see.

01:02:05.595 --> 01:02:08.033
All right.

01:02:14.343 --> 01:02:16.640
What I want to know is...

01:02:16.717 --> 01:02:20.040
... who were Mr. Mitra's
warishan (heirs)?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.640
Who went to Washington?

01:02:23.528 --> 01:02:26.040
Warishan - heirs!

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:28.120
Oh, air.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.640
- H-E-I-R-S -

01:02:33.564 --> 01:02:36.080
I see, heirs (Warishan).

01:02:36.388 --> 01:02:38.640
Yes, Mr. Mitra's heirs.

01:02:39.771 --> 01:02:42.640
Were his three children.

01:02:44.037 --> 01:02:46.640
Did he provide for
all 3 in his will?

01:02:47.772 --> 01:02:48.880
Bromide?

01:02:53.718 --> 01:02:55.348
In Mr. Mitra's will.

01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:59.458
Yes, yes. The elder son
got his share.

01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:04.120
The daughter Nila got hers.
Sizable amount.

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:08.640
You see, he was the
leading ENT specialist then.

01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:14.640
I met him in his chamber.

01:03:16.468 --> 01:03:18.640
I'd been to Delhi.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:22.120
It was before the
time of jets.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.400
At the time of landing,...

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:33.842
... my ears got blocked.
They refused to open.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.120
I came back to Calcutta...

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.400
... to meet Mr. Mitra.

01:03:42.558 --> 01:03:44.120
He was on the rise then.

01:03:47.944 --> 01:03:50.120
He inserted a tube
into the nostrils.

01:03:51.441 --> 01:03:53.120
Blew air through it.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.440
His youngest son
Mr. Mitra.

01:03:59.517 --> 01:04:00.640
Yes, Monu.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.640
Manmohan.
- Did he have a share too?

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.640
Certainly.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.640
But he was missing at
the time.

01:04:11.524 --> 01:04:14.451
All that we knew was that...

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.640
... he was still alive.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.348
D'you know that
he's come back?

01:04:23.906 --> 01:04:25.640
No, I don't.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:30.280
Will he get his share now?
- What?

01:04:35.861 --> 01:04:39.120
Will he get his share if
he comes back?

01:04:40.106 --> 01:04:42.040
Why not?

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.040
Money is not camphor
that it will evaporate.

01:04:47.245 --> 01:04:49.080
He'll get it if he
stakes his claims.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.076
Of course, he'll have to
prove his identity.

01:04:56.151 --> 01:04:58.640
Will a passport do?

01:04:59.317 --> 01:05:00.120
Oh yes.

01:05:03.137 --> 01:05:07.120
Where is the money now?
With whom?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.862
With the executor Mitra
has appointed.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.805
It's in the Bank
in his account.

01:05:18.643 --> 01:05:22.120
Is he likely to be a
friend of Mohini?

01:05:23.469 --> 01:05:27.640
Why French? More likely
to be a Bengali.

01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:30.909
When Mitra died,...

01:05:32.041 --> 01:05:35.640
...I was away in Singapore,
at my son-in-law's.

01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:52.480
What is that?

01:05:54.655 --> 01:05:57.395
Savage Music.
- How did you come by it?

01:05:58.568 --> 01:05:59.640
Magic!

01:06:01.878 --> 01:06:04.120
I have found out.
- What?

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:07.043
Who are you?
- Well, who am I?

01:06:07.389 --> 01:06:08.640
My great uncle.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.640
Real or fake?
- Real.

01:06:12.505 --> 01:06:14.640
How did you know?
The others don't.

01:06:18.151 --> 01:06:18.920
Magic.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.240
So I'll call you
great uncle from now?

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.800
And more than a great uncle.
- What are you?

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.422
Hopping great uncle
- Hopping great uncle?

01:06:29.588 --> 01:06:33.160
Yes, I'm always ready to
go hopping.

01:06:33.687 --> 01:06:35.240
All my life I've been hopping
from place to place.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.800
I'll rest here a few days
and then go hopping again.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.480
Do you like it here?

01:06:41.378 --> 01:06:43.598
I'll stay as long as I do.

01:06:44.221 --> 01:06:45.570
Then you'll go
hopping again?

01:06:47.145 --> 01:06:51.385
Wait, I'll teach you a new word.
Very funny word.

01:06:52.514 --> 01:06:54.385
"Kupa-munduk".

01:06:55.825 --> 01:06:57.682
"Kupa-munduk?"

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.705
Kupa is a well and munduk
is a frog.

01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:04.958
A frog in the well?

01:07:05.035 --> 01:07:08.216
Yes, just this,
how terrible it is!

01:07:08.393 --> 01:07:11.704
Dark, Dank, Smelly, Slimy...

01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:14.025
... and yet the frog never
moves from there.

01:07:14.385 --> 01:07:16.530
There are such frogs
among people also.

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:20.385
They are called stay at homes.
I'm not one of them.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.465
That's why, I am on the move
so much of the time.

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:25.385
What if I go out too?
- You must.

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:27.905
If you don't, how can
you eat armadillo meat.

01:07:28.103 --> 01:07:29.465
What meat?

01:07:29.764 --> 01:07:32.585
Meat of the ant eater
armadillo.

01:07:32.772 --> 01:07:34.246
Who eats such meat?

01:07:35.907 --> 01:07:39.684
If I tell you everything I'll
run out of stock of stories.

01:07:39.861 --> 01:07:41.025
Wait.

01:07:41.459 --> 01:07:43.585
And then you'll have
your reward.

01:07:53.405 --> 01:07:58.865
God! Both my pharynx and
larynx are gone.

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:03.585
A hearing aid that serves
no function at all.

01:08:04.157 --> 01:08:05.385
Share?

01:08:07.121 --> 01:08:10.385
He believes your uncle
did have a share.

01:08:11.604 --> 01:08:15.785
But he was away in
Singapore at the time...

01:08:16.129 --> 01:08:17.905
... of your grandpa's death,...

01:08:19.056 --> 01:08:23.905
... in case your grandpa,...

01:08:24.025 --> 01:08:27.705
... thinking his youngest son
wouldn't return,...

01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:29.905
... has changed his will
at the last moment.

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.385
Mr. Mukherji was in
no position to know.

01:08:35.619 --> 01:08:36.865
That must have been it.

01:08:38.307 --> 01:08:39.905
It didn't strike me
that way at all.

01:08:40.974 --> 01:08:43.196
If uncle had a share,...

01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:45.145
... Mr. Sital would
certainly would have known...

01:08:45.385 --> 01:08:47.161
... and informed uncle...

01:08:47.237 --> 01:08:50.990
... and uncle wouldn't
hide the good news.

01:09:03.517 --> 01:09:04.385
Why not?

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:10.865
A man whose hand is
tied,...

01:09:11.385 --> 01:09:14.207
... is also likely to
have a closed mind.

01:09:14.549 --> 01:09:15.905
Tight fisted.

01:09:16.324 --> 01:09:19.905
A man who comes to see his
niece after 35 years...

01:09:20.025 --> 01:09:21.316
...empty handed,...

01:09:21.742 --> 01:09:23.545
...he is bound to be
tight fisted.

01:09:23.921 --> 01:09:25.463
Anyway, we'll surely know...

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.865
... what kind of a man he is
after tonight's grilling.

01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:41.905
What are you doing?

01:09:48.563 --> 01:09:50.865
Whatever else uncle
may be he's no thief.

01:09:57.546 --> 01:09:58.301
Beautiful!

01:10:01.315 --> 01:10:03.265
Was this here yesterday?

01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:06.865
No, it wasn't.

01:10:08.015 --> 01:10:09.025
Pal bronze.

01:10:10.822 --> 01:10:12.025
Rajput miniatures.

01:10:13.618 --> 01:10:14.545
Ivory.

01:10:15.761 --> 01:10:17.545
Is it your collection,
Sudhin?

01:10:17.945 --> 01:10:20.025
No, my father's.

01:10:21.498 --> 01:10:23.185
I noticed this instrument
yesterday.

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:26.345
Is that a Sitar or a Tanpura?
- Tanpura.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:29.545
So you sing, do you?
- Occasionally.

01:10:29.817 --> 01:10:35.156
She not only sings
but dances too.

01:10:35.372 --> 01:10:37.008
A dance recital would be
too tall an order.

01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:39.034
But it would be nice, if you
could give us a song.

01:10:39.316 --> 01:10:40.753
What about it, dear?

01:10:40.829 --> 01:10:43.225
Haven't heard a Bengali song
ever since I left home.

01:10:43.385 --> 01:10:45.153
I'll sing when you've
finished your tea.

01:10:45.337 --> 01:10:46.665
Very well.

01:10:49.347 --> 01:10:50.545
Where is Bablu?

01:10:50.808 --> 01:10:55.025
He's gone to his friends house.
Where the Durga festival is on.

01:10:55.192 --> 01:10:58.545
By the way, if you wish to smoke,
please go ahead.

01:10:59.025 --> 01:11:00.599
Some people don't smoke
in the presence of elders.

01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:04.545
I don't believe in such
show of respect.

01:11:07.912 --> 01:11:10.945
Is it the Durga Festival that
has brought you at this time?

01:11:11.021 --> 01:11:13.185
I didn't even know the
festival season was on.

01:11:15.364 --> 01:11:17.985
Do you know how many times
the Goddess Durga...

01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:22.545
... slew the Buffalo Demon?
- I thought only once.

01:11:26.025 --> 01:11:29.025
D'you know Ganesh has the
head of an elephant?

01:11:29.445 --> 01:11:31.545
I did, but I've
forgotten.

01:11:32.025 --> 01:11:36.166
I heard all the mythologies
from my grandma.

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:37.705
I still remember them.

01:11:37.999 --> 01:11:39.905
How do you think our
country is shaping?

01:11:40.324 --> 01:11:41.545
D'you read the papers?

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.025
Caste and religion, which
create serious problems.

01:11:47.584 --> 01:11:49.265
The newspapers bear
testimony to that.

01:11:52.825 --> 01:11:54.985
Do you believe
in Dharma?

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.985
By Dharma you mean
religion I suppose.

01:11:58.171 --> 01:12:01.025
But in our scriptures, Dharma
means something quite different.

01:12:01.545 --> 01:12:03.545
I mean religion.

01:12:05.025 --> 01:12:07.025
I'll answer your
question later.

01:12:07.185 --> 01:12:10.025
Have you finished your tea?
- Yes.

01:12:10.185 --> 01:12:11.815
Ready, dear?
- Yes.

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:13.545
Silence please.

01:12:16.884 --> 01:12:22.348
"Who plays the Veena.."

01:12:23.269 --> 01:12:33.025
"Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?"

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:37.856
"Who plays the Veena.."

01:12:38.305 --> 01:12:45.213
"Showering melody upon
my secluded life."

01:12:45.437 --> 01:12:55.800
"Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?"

01:12:55.966 --> 01:13:00.897
"Who plays the Veena.."

01:13:02.334 --> 01:13:08.943
"My heart opens up like
the morning lotus."

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:15.619
"My heart opens up like
the morning lotus."

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:22.734
"And wait for a pair of
damp feet to approach me."

01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:33.353
"Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?"

01:13:33.635 --> 01:13:38.924
"Who plays the Veena.."

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:46.428
"Grace and beauty awakens..."

01:13:46.818 --> 01:13:52.850
"... and my heart
fills with joy."

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:59.545
"Grace and beauty awakens..."

01:14:00.196 --> 01:14:06.025
"... and my heart
fills with joy."

01:14:07.136 --> 01:14:10.169
"A fresh breeze flows..."

01:14:10.396 --> 01:14:13.545
"... and stirs everything
to a new life."

01:14:13.622 --> 01:14:16.785
"A fresh breeze flows..."

01:14:16.862 --> 01:14:20.012
"... and stirs everything
to a new life."

01:14:20.353 --> 01:14:27.545
"Reaching the depth
of my being,..."

01:14:28.526 --> 01:14:37.883
"... who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?"

01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:42.910
"Who plays the Veena.."

01:14:44.774 --> 01:14:52.025
"My heart has known pain.
Both the happiness and sorrow."

01:14:52.185 --> 01:15:00.406
"But I have had no song
to express it."

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:08.060
"My heart has known pain.
Both the happiness and sorrow."

01:15:08.401 --> 01:15:16.606
"But I have had no song
to express it."

01:15:17.092 --> 01:15:23.465
"And all my desire
comes out into the open."

01:15:23.757 --> 01:15:30.025
"And all my desire
comes out into the open."

01:15:30.406 --> 01:15:37.735
"And the river and forest
trembles in sympathy."

01:15:38.546 --> 01:15:47.545
"Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?"

01:15:48.016 --> 01:15:52.849
"Who plays the Veena.."

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:02.025
Lovely!

01:16:03.745 --> 01:16:05.105
Reminds me
of my sister.

01:16:16.065 --> 01:16:17.745
What was the question?

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:21.745
Whether you believe
in religion or not?

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.945
Oh yes, religion.

01:16:30.985 --> 01:16:35.985
Mr. Sen Gupta. I happen to be
a bit unorthodox in my views.

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.545
That's all right.

01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:45.705
I don't believe in something which
creates barriers between people.

01:16:46.671 --> 01:16:51.425
Religion does that.
Particularly organised religion.

01:16:52.412 --> 01:16:55.745
For the same reason,
I don't believe in caste.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.345
What about God?

01:17:08.644 --> 01:17:18.985
"Gives light to the blind,
life to the dying."

01:17:26.872 --> 01:17:30.425
Who will give "light" ?

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:33.425
Who will give life?

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:40.985
The trouble is, it is
extremely difficult...

01:17:41.468 --> 01:17:45.992
..to believe in a
benevolent God these days.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:54.425
The daily papers alone make us
question that belief.

01:17:54.927 --> 01:17:56.425
What can you do?

01:18:00.814 --> 01:18:03.425
I am of the same
opinion as you are.

01:18:04.172 --> 01:18:07.985
But, what about science?

01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:11.985
Voyager has sent
pictures of Neptune.

01:18:12.185 --> 01:18:13.985
What do you think of that?

01:18:14.516 --> 01:18:17.646
For a change,
let's hear what you think.

01:18:18.781 --> 01:18:20.046
Nothing special.

01:18:20.123 --> 01:18:24.425
Mine is the opinion of
an average educated person.

01:18:24.652 --> 01:18:26.046
And what is that?

01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:28.985
The advance in technology
has been phenomenal.

01:18:29.062 --> 01:18:32.841
Something we couldn't
dream of a few years back.

01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:41.105
Now look at something else.

01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:47.094
Millions of people mostly
young are injecting...

01:18:47.171 --> 01:18:49.560
... the deadliest of drugs...

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.814
... into their system by means
of hypodermic needles...

01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:56.425
...and signing their
death warrants.

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:00.745
What technology is there to put
a stop to this, Mr. Sen Gupta?

01:19:04.414 --> 01:19:08.387
You've been living in the
West, haven't you?

01:19:08.679 --> 01:19:10.025
Yes.

01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:14.386
Why? The West is ruled
by technology.

01:19:14.614 --> 01:19:16.754
If it is something
so unsavory to you,...

01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:18.603
... why don't you go and
stay with the jungle folk?

01:19:18.679 --> 01:19:20.791
But that is Clairvoyance.

01:19:20.868 --> 01:19:23.105
It certainly doesn't come
under the purview of science.

01:19:26.105 --> 01:19:31.025
You mean, you have actually
lived with these jungle folks?

01:19:34.284 --> 01:19:38.625
After leaving home, I spent 5 years
in the country in tribal areas.

01:19:39.343 --> 01:19:40.948
Starting with the Santhals,...

01:19:41.025 --> 01:19:45.385
... I studied the Kols,
Bhils, Nagas, Mundas...

01:19:45.905 --> 01:19:48.748
...Murias, Marias,
Oraons, Todas...

01:19:48.825 --> 01:19:50.265
It's an endless list...

01:19:50.342 --> 01:19:53.625
You actually spent time
with these tribals?

01:19:54.105 --> 01:19:57.343
Have you ever tasted
rat-meat?

01:19:58.024 --> 01:20:00.625
Snake meat?
Bat meat?

01:20:00.894 --> 01:20:04.576
I told you I was omnivorous.
I'm not using a figure of speech.

01:20:04.653 --> 01:20:06.105
It's plain truth.

01:20:08.338 --> 01:20:16.105
It doesn't seem likely that in
these 5 years you earned anything.

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:19.625
On the contrary, I reached
the end of my resources.

01:20:21.944 --> 01:20:24.745
You must be wondering where
the resources came from.

01:20:25.349 --> 01:20:29.647
I don't imagine your father
sponsored your disappearance.

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:36.625
I'll tell you
what happened.

01:20:38.242 --> 01:20:41.305
My grandmother,
the late "Giribala Dasi",...

01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:44.625
... whom I mentioned
a little while ago,...

01:20:44.859 --> 01:20:47.065
... was extremely
fond of me.

01:20:47.225 --> 01:20:49.625
Went to the length
of spoiling me.

01:20:50.226 --> 01:20:52.625
I stood first in my
matriculation exam,...

01:20:52.702 --> 01:20:54.604
... as well as in my
intermediate exam.

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.985
When I got first class
in B.A.,...

01:20:57.199 --> 01:21:00.637
...my grandma made me a gift
of large sum of money,...

01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:05.470
Saying, you've brought
great honour to our family.

01:21:05.547 --> 01:21:08.145
May God bless you.

01:21:09.604 --> 01:21:13.665
3000 rupees was no joke
in those days.

01:21:14.324 --> 01:21:17.227
So, I left home
with my own resources.

01:21:17.437 --> 01:21:20.385
I didn't have to beg,
borrow or steal.

01:21:21.625 --> 01:21:22.625
I get it.

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:27.265
But you said you had
run out of your resources.

01:21:27.994 --> 01:21:31.105
Here a question naturally
arises.

01:21:32.341 --> 01:21:34.265
Who paid for
your trip abroad...

01:21:42.103 --> 01:21:45.105
... and then,
after you arrived in London?

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:48.105
And the 5 years not
just in London,...

01:21:48.412 --> 01:21:49.825
...but in various
cities in Europe.

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:52.025
What did you do there?

01:21:52.677 --> 01:21:54.625
I struggled to make
both ends meet.

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:58.625
Struggle - a favourite
word with the Bengalis.

01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:01.625
But I don't call it struggle.

01:22:02.325 --> 01:22:06.025
I think of it as nutrition for
the brain and for the muscle...

01:22:07.579 --> 01:22:10.865
... and as the first step in
getting to know your fellow beings.

01:22:12.286 --> 01:22:15.192
When did you return
to the jungles?

01:22:15.827 --> 01:22:18.073
All these experiences,
it seems to me,...

01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:20.134
... took place
in civilized cities.

01:22:37.375 --> 01:22:44.251
Have patience,
dear beloved.

01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:48.207
I may go to Mathura soon.

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.494
My autobiography won't get you
much nearer the truth my friend.

01:23:00.052 --> 01:23:02.686
You're trying to reach
the core of the person...

01:23:02.763 --> 01:23:04.625
... by peeling the layers
of the onion, aren't you?

01:23:05.786 --> 01:23:07.625
The task is not an easy one.

01:23:08.743 --> 01:23:11.625
Even so, for the sake of
the record, let me tell you...

01:23:12.338 --> 01:23:15.105
... and by the time I had started
writing for various journals,...

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:17.985
... as a result
I had a bank balance,...

01:23:19.057 --> 01:23:21.425
... which again led me to my
second phase of scholarship.

01:23:21.845 --> 01:23:23.625
A degree in anthropology...

01:23:25.685 --> 01:23:27.028
... and then on to
the United States.

01:23:27.762 --> 01:23:29.985
United States?
- United States of America.

01:23:30.537 --> 01:23:33.106
Reason?
- Indians.

01:23:33.365 --> 01:23:36.971
Oh, I see - American Indians.

01:23:38.658 --> 01:23:40.145
A cabin boy again?

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:43.025
No, Sir.
Don't mind.

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:47.465
I may sound I am beating
my own drum.

01:23:47.842 --> 01:23:51.145
But there too I stood
first in the examination.

01:23:52.279 --> 01:23:54.305
As a result, I didn't
have to struggle anymore.

01:23:54.465 --> 01:23:59.115
A well known Anthropological Society
paid for my travels in the USA...

01:24:00.204 --> 01:24:01.255
...on condition that...

01:24:01.332 --> 01:24:04.465
...I regularly send them written
accounts of my experiments...

01:24:04.888 --> 01:24:06.465
... along with photographs.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.465
I fulfilled the condition.

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.625
In North and South
Americas,...

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:15.025
...I spent time studying
43 different tribes.

01:24:16.044 --> 01:24:19.465
It was this experience,
which really opened my eyes.

01:24:20.248 --> 01:24:21.298
Very well.

01:24:25.503 --> 01:24:26.945
You sit down.

01:24:27.065 --> 01:24:29.025
You're beginning
to sound hoarse.

01:24:29.145 --> 01:24:30.145
As you wish.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:33.745
You listen while I talk.

01:24:34.038 --> 01:24:35.265
Correct me if I am wrong.

01:24:38.025 --> 01:24:40.385
The upshot is...

01:24:41.085 --> 01:24:44.926
all these experiences
has led you to believe...

01:24:45.102 --> 01:24:48.465
...that the so called urban
civilization is an eye wash.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.905
Real civilization is to be
found among the tribals.

01:24:52.225 --> 01:24:56.025
Let me tell you that although
I am city born and bred,...

01:24:56.269 --> 01:24:58.305
... I am not ignorant
about tribal life.

01:24:58.465 --> 01:25:00.625
I have read quite
a few books on the subject.

01:25:01.064 --> 01:25:05.145
I know they have their own
language, their own religion,...

01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:09.085
...their art, their culture,
their music, etc., etc.,

01:25:16.423 --> 01:25:17.465
What is etc. etc.?

01:25:18.465 --> 01:25:21.465
You must tell these people what
you're hiding behind that word

01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:23.465
Otherwise how
will they know me?

01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:25.745
How will they know about
tribal civilazation?

01:25:26.025 --> 01:25:28.025
You tell me what
I have left out!

01:25:28.145 --> 01:25:31.233
My good man,
the main things!

01:25:32.025 --> 01:25:34.564
Science, technology

01:25:35.177 --> 01:25:38.705
You're thinking only of
Neptune and voyager

01:25:39.214 --> 01:25:41.705
Just turn your
thoughts to Man

01:25:42.307 --> 01:25:45.742
In the most primitive
barbaric state...

01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:51.823
try to figure out how they
could learn hunting, pottery...

01:25:52.384 --> 01:25:55.716
...and everything needed to
lead a decent human existence

01:25:56.204 --> 01:25:58.225
Then there's architecture

01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:01.825
Even a simple mud hut shows
evidence of architecture

01:26:02.105 --> 01:26:05.025
Do you know the igloo?
The dwelling of the Eskimos?

01:26:05.908 --> 01:26:08.025
Do you know that two kinds of
ice are used to build it?

01:26:08.844 --> 01:26:12.777
One is opaque, which
is used in the roofing.

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.819
And the other is
transparent.

01:26:16.399 --> 01:26:18.505
Which is used to build
rectangular windows.

01:26:18.963 --> 01:26:20.625
How will you describe
such a kind of activity?

01:26:20.934 --> 01:26:23.385
Isn't this science?
Isn't this technology?

01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:24.785
Nonsense!

01:26:30.918 --> 01:26:34.613
Do you send for a shaman to
treat you when you are unwell?

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.465
I have had recourse to that.

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:40.625
I had no option.

01:26:42.117 --> 01:26:44.385
Where would you find a
doctor in a jungle?

01:26:46.248 --> 01:26:48.385
But d'you know the kind of
the shaman he is?

01:26:48.926 --> 01:26:52.505
The properties of 500 medicinal
plants are on his finger tips.

01:26:53.025 --> 01:26:54.465
He was able to cure me.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.225
Normally, I wouldn't
send for a shaman.

01:26:59.066 --> 01:27:02.625
Not when I sit on a sofa
having tea and biscuits with you.

01:27:04.389 --> 01:27:06.145
Why do you insist on twist
around something,...

01:27:06.305 --> 01:27:07.866
...which is basically
very simple?

01:27:08.032 --> 01:27:11.705
Why don't you see that
I'm not a savage myself?

01:27:12.705 --> 01:27:16.705
It's my greatest regret
that I'm not a savage.

01:27:17.225 --> 01:27:20.225
That I can't draw bisons
like a cave hunter.

01:27:22.198 --> 01:27:24.225
But how can I help it?

01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:33.705
I've Shakespeare and Tagore
Marx & Freud in my blood stream.

01:27:35.225 --> 01:27:37.705
That's why, I can't do
without field notes.

01:27:38.705 --> 01:27:41.002
I wouldn't need them,
if I was a savage, would I?

01:27:47.225 --> 01:27:51.225
You claim to have
studied the Murias.

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:53.385
I do.

01:27:54.122 --> 01:27:56.225
What do you think of what
goes on in the Ghotuls?

01:27:56.425 --> 01:27:59.269
The sexual freedom that
the young Murias enjoy,...

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:00.665
Sorry, Nili.

01:28:00.825 --> 01:28:02.705
What do your field notes
say about that?

01:28:03.158 --> 01:28:05.192
Doesn't that amount to
extreme promiscuity?

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.225
Or would you call that
civilized too?

01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:16.865
What you feel in your
heart, I feel in mine.

01:28:18.455 --> 01:28:23.225
What I feel in my heart,
you feel in yours.

01:28:24.865 --> 01:28:26.705
Holy wedlock.

01:28:27.764 --> 01:28:29.850
That is civilized.

01:28:30.266 --> 01:28:35.545
A little while ago you
called yourself omnivorous.

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.065
Have you tasted
human flesh?

01:28:39.544 --> 01:28:41.705
No, I haven't had
the good fortune.

01:28:41.905 --> 01:28:43.025
Good fortune?

01:28:44.425 --> 01:28:48.785
I've heard human flesh is tasty!
But I haven't eaten it.

01:28:50.607 --> 01:28:55.225
My claim was a fake one
Anila - I'm sorry.

01:28:55.806 --> 01:28:57.530
Where in the scale of
civilized behaviour...

01:28:57.606 --> 01:29:00.225
... would you
place cannibals?

01:29:00.798 --> 01:29:03.825
Civilized?

01:29:04.705 --> 01:29:07.225
It's barbaric!

01:29:07.845 --> 01:29:09.225
Do you know who is
really civilized?

01:29:09.963 --> 01:29:13.788
It's the man who by using his thumb,
presses a button...

01:29:13.865 --> 01:29:17.560
which releases a weapon which
obliterates an entire city...

01:29:17.637 --> 01:29:19.705
... with all its
inhabitants...

01:29:20.871 --> 01:29:22.705
...and you know where
who's more civilized?

01:29:22.865 --> 01:29:25.225
It's those who take
the decision...

01:29:25.697 --> 01:29:27.425
to use the weapon,
without turning a hair.

01:29:32.705 --> 01:29:34.985
Well, Mr. Sen Gupta.

01:29:35.588 --> 01:29:37.705
The surname doesn't come
easily, does it?

01:29:38.058 --> 01:29:43.145
Still you are so unsure
of my identity.

01:29:44.068 --> 01:29:46.350
May I request something?
I have used a pen name.

01:29:46.527 --> 01:29:50.705
A name very dear to me
in my early years.

01:29:51.135 --> 01:29:52.225
Nemo.

01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:54.154
I suggest that you use that.

01:29:57.305 --> 01:30:02.305
Yes, Latin expression
meaning 'No One'!

01:30:03.309 --> 01:30:05.025
And apt name for me,
isn't it?

01:30:05.426 --> 01:30:06.858
That's exactly what
we're trying to decide.

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:09.705
Whether you are 'No One'
or 'Some One'.

01:30:10.813 --> 01:30:13.185
Do you know what
a serious problem...

01:30:13.385 --> 01:30:15.705
...you've set for
my friends here?

01:30:17.025 --> 01:30:18.234
Do you know, they've lost...

01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:19.656
their peace of mind
since you came here?

01:30:21.025 --> 01:30:22.945
It's just because
they're decent people...

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:25.785
...that they have been too
generous with their hospitality.

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:28.665
But you've refused to
make it clear to them,...

01:30:28.742 --> 01:30:31.385
whether you're welcome
or unwelcome as a guest.

01:30:32.225 --> 01:30:35.225
You've said your passport
proves nothing.

01:30:35.887 --> 01:30:38.825
Surely, you yourself know
if its genuine or fake.

01:30:39.063 --> 01:30:41.574
Then why can't you come out
and tell them the truth?

01:31:18.262 --> 01:31:20.494
I'll be off now.

01:31:25.163 --> 01:31:26.225
Listen, listen.

01:31:27.633 --> 01:31:29.985
Did you really have
to be so harsh?

01:31:30.062 --> 01:31:32.545
He is unfit for
civilized society.

01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:34.705
He has no right to encroach
on your hospitality.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.785
Why talk of encroachment,

01:31:37.783 --> 01:31:39.585
...when he is only here
for a short while?

01:31:40.014 --> 01:31:42.398
And you swore not to grill him,
but go about it gently.

01:31:42.475 --> 01:31:44.625
He should know
where he stands.

01:31:45.526 --> 01:31:47.025
I know your wife and
I know...

01:31:47.197 --> 01:31:48.785
...what she is serving him
for lunch or dinner.

01:31:48.862 --> 01:31:51.597
Not field rat meat, surely.

01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:53.468
If I hadn't kicked him off.

01:31:53.545 --> 01:31:56.392
He'd have a stuck
to you like a leech.

01:31:56.983 --> 01:31:59.475
You don't know these
parasites, I do.

01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:21.207
I don't know how to...

01:32:29.282 --> 01:32:31.046
I feel miserable.

01:32:33.122 --> 01:32:35.883
Even at dinner,
he didn't say a word.

01:32:43.748 --> 01:32:45.945
If I knew Pritish
would talk like that,...

01:32:47.464 --> 01:32:50.665
I'd certainly not
have asked him to come.

01:32:51.553 --> 01:32:54.635
He mentioned traditional
hospitality in his letter.

01:32:56.119 --> 01:32:57.425
Is this a sample of that?

01:33:02.596 --> 01:33:04.425
What we have to do
now is...

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:07.425
... to wipe out from his
mind the feeling of hurt...

01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:10.065
... that tonight's behaviour
has caused him.

01:33:12.133 --> 01:33:15.818
Shall I ask you something?
- What?

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:19.825
Did you have the least idea
that...

01:33:21.398 --> 01:33:24.945
... he's spent half his
life in this fashion?

01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:29.425
None at all.

01:33:32.036 --> 01:33:35.523
Extraordinary life,
full of strange experience.

01:33:38.128 --> 01:33:40.425
It's certainly been an
education listening to him.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.425
But at the same time,...

01:33:43.597 --> 01:33:45.425
...I felt a distance
growing between us...

01:33:48.682 --> 01:33:51.837
... and uncle is someone
you can warm to.

01:33:52.274 --> 01:33:54.865
In this case,

01:33:56.580 --> 01:34:00.949
...you feel for him is
reverence and respect.

01:34:02.983 --> 01:34:04.425
The problem is...

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:09.945
erudition works
on the brain,...

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:14.774
... not on the heart.

01:34:18.396 --> 01:34:20.425
You can't bring yourself
to behave like a savage.

01:34:22.308 --> 01:34:24.425
If you could, you could've
easier access to your uncle.

01:34:27.073 --> 01:34:28.425
That can never be.

01:34:29.822 --> 01:34:34.005
But there is no doubt that
we have to make peace with him.

01:34:36.661 --> 01:34:38.945
More than anything else,
he is our guest.

01:34:39.609 --> 01:34:41.644
As such, we have no right
to hurt his feelings.

01:34:43.605 --> 01:34:45.425
You can address him as
uncle if this would help.

01:34:46.303 --> 01:34:47.425
I won't mind...

01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:54.067
... that I will,
if it comes from my heart.

01:34:55.769 --> 01:34:58.405
I refuse to be a hypocrite.

01:35:27.848 --> 01:35:29.634
Listen.

01:35:32.489 --> 01:35:33.838
What is it?
- He's gone.

01:35:34.035 --> 01:35:35.622
His room is empty.
- What?

01:35:35.883 --> 01:35:37.518
He's gone away with
all his belongings.

01:35:37.595 --> 01:35:38.825
This key was the
only thing left.

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:43.665
This is just what
I feared.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.945
What shall we do now?
- Wait a minute.

01:35:48.503 --> 01:35:50.360
Let us put two and two
together.

01:35:51.346 --> 01:35:52.727
Should we inform the police?

01:36:00.894 --> 01:36:02.202
Give me the directory.

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.425
Who do you want me
to phone?

01:36:06.467 --> 01:36:10.650
I'm working on a hunch.
Give me the book.

01:36:21.235 --> 01:36:22.371
Who is it?

01:36:23.529 --> 01:36:24.850
The main door is open, Sir.

01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:28.770
Since when?

01:36:28.847 --> 01:36:29.985
More than an hour.

01:36:30.172 --> 01:36:32.370
Your door was shut, so I
couldn't come and tell you.

01:36:32.490 --> 01:36:33.850
It's all right.
You may go now.

01:36:34.022 --> 01:36:35.370
Mummy.

01:36:37.956 --> 01:36:40.210
There is no one
in Great-uncle's room.

01:36:41.453 --> 01:36:44.451
I know.
- Where has he gone?

01:36:45.595 --> 01:36:46.197
I don't know.

01:36:48.968 --> 01:36:50.451
What's that?

01:36:51.615 --> 01:36:55.251
Subscriber Trunk Dialing - STD.

01:36:55.973 --> 01:36:57.930
Do you know
Mr. Sital's number?

01:37:00.613 --> 01:37:02.076
Then you tell him.

01:37:02.153 --> 01:37:03.550
What'll I say?

01:37:04.255 --> 01:37:06.250
Listen carefully.

01:37:07.339 --> 01:37:10.815
Ask him first, if he had
been the executor...

01:37:10.892 --> 01:37:13.191
...of your
grandfather's will.

01:37:14.405 --> 01:37:18.450
If he says yes,
then ask him...

01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:21.450
...if your uncle had
a share and...

01:37:22.012 --> 01:37:25.054
... if the money
is still with him.

01:37:26.818 --> 01:37:35.921
Has he informed your uncle
about his share?

01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:41.204
If he says yes,
then tell him.

01:37:41.484 --> 01:37:42.822
We'll be soon on our way
to Shantiniketan.

01:37:43.228 --> 01:37:44.981
And will arrive around
two in the afternoon.

01:37:45.698 --> 01:37:46.798
We'll have lunch
on the way.

01:37:46.875 --> 01:37:48.209
So he mustn't
worry on that count.

01:37:49.164 --> 01:37:50.109
Come on, ring him up.

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:30.429
Come, dear.

01:38:39.198 --> 01:38:40.930
How are you, young man?

01:38:41.804 --> 01:38:43.620
Hasn't he come?
- Oh, yes.

01:38:43.962 --> 01:38:45.716
The train arrived
more than an hour ago.

01:38:46.339 --> 01:38:49.297
Where is he?
- Come, I'll tell you everything.

01:38:49.515 --> 01:38:52.450
You said on the phone that
he is a little temperamental.

01:38:52.753 --> 01:38:55.930
I found him quite
most emphatically so.

01:38:58.513 --> 01:39:00.930
He came here last in 55.

01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:07.251
You know, I had carried him
in my arms to the zoo.

01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.450
Where has he gone?

01:39:10.002 --> 01:39:12.876
He's had nothing to eat
in the morning.

01:39:13.374 --> 01:39:15.273
I asked him, don't you
want a lunch?

01:39:15.657 --> 01:39:16.706
He said, no.

01:39:16.872 --> 01:39:18.895
Not even a cup of tea?
No.

01:39:19.331 --> 01:39:20.597
Then what was the point
in coming, I asked him.

01:39:20.846 --> 01:39:22.155
We have met after
such a long time ...

01:39:22.319 --> 01:39:24.230
... and all you have in mind
is a cold monetary transaction.

01:39:24.613 --> 01:39:26.293
Is that not true?

01:39:26.565 --> 01:39:27.653
What did he say?

01:39:28.008 --> 01:39:29.973
He said, well,
he needed the money.

01:39:30.685 --> 01:39:32.377
But the formalities
can wait because...

01:39:32.678 --> 01:39:33.961
..he's come to stay for
a few days and will go back...

01:39:34.037 --> 01:39:36.453
.. and catch a plane from
Calcutta. So there was no hurry.

01:39:36.773 --> 01:39:39.413
In any case, today is a Sunday.
The bank is closed.

01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:41.373
So he'd have to wait
a day any way.

01:39:41.759 --> 01:39:43.293
If you told us where
he is now,... ?

01:39:43.453 --> 01:39:46.844
... have you been there before?
- I have.

01:39:47.133 --> 01:39:48.373
Before my marriage,
three times.

01:39:48.826 --> 01:39:52.084
There's a tribal village
on the way called Baner Pukur.

01:39:52.345 --> 01:39:53.373
That's where he has gone.

01:39:54.244 --> 01:39:56.973
Said before leaving India he'd
spend some time in this village.

01:39:57.585 --> 01:40:00.973
Don't ask him what drew him
there in the first place.

01:40:01.706 --> 01:40:03.173
Such a long time
since we met.

01:40:03.345 --> 01:40:04.881
One would expect
he would sit down...

01:40:04.958 --> 01:40:08.053
...and talk about
his experiences.

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.786
And you know the
funniest thing?

01:40:11.336 --> 01:40:17.138
Before touching my feet
he held up his passport to prove...

01:40:17.214 --> 01:40:21.973
... that he was really
Manmohan Mitra.

01:40:25.093 --> 01:40:26.832
Well, since we've come
around to look for him, ...

01:40:26.908 --> 01:40:28.368
... perhaps we ought to go and
see if we can hunt him out.

01:40:28.444 --> 01:40:31.933
Very well. And if you find him,
just grab him and bring him here.

01:40:32.053 --> 01:40:33.533
That's what we'll do.

01:40:35.113 --> 01:40:35.933
By the way,...

01:40:36.053 --> 01:40:37.734
... I hope he's not gone off
his rocker, has he?

01:40:37.811 --> 01:40:40.453
Oh, no.
- Such a lot of money.

01:40:40.733 --> 01:40:42.973
I've been guarding it like
a treasure for over 2 years.

01:40:43.497 --> 01:40:46.653
5 lakh. You can imagine what
the amount has come to now.

01:40:46.985 --> 01:40:49.973
Don't worry,
he is perfectly sound.

01:41:40.933 --> 01:41:41.933
You there.

01:41:44.402 --> 01:41:46.933
Bring a cot and place
it here, will you?

01:41:48.054 --> 01:41:49.413
I'm expecting visitors.

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:01.413
There. There's Great uncle.

01:42:33.989 --> 01:42:35.093
Come.

01:42:36.054 --> 01:42:37.093
Sit down.

01:42:41.613 --> 01:42:45.093
Why did you have to do such
a thing without telling us?

01:42:48.093 --> 01:42:50.093
I felt very restless.

01:42:50.607 --> 01:42:56.093
We're extremely sorry for
what happened that night.

01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:59.413
Shall I tell you
the truth?

01:43:00.736 --> 01:43:04.013
I'm used to the ways of
the jungle folk.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.093
If I find somebody throwing
his weight around, ...

01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:09.838
.. I can't put up
with that.

01:43:10.045 --> 01:43:12.373
You've had nothing
to eat since morning.

01:43:14.093 --> 01:43:16.093
We've come to
take you back.

01:43:16.875 --> 01:43:18.293
Come.

01:43:19.345 --> 01:43:20.813
Not now.

01:43:21.876 --> 01:43:24.093
It does no harm to fast
for a part of the day.

01:43:25.613 --> 01:43:27.613
There'll be dancing
this afternoon.

01:43:28.613 --> 01:43:30.093
I have arranged it.

01:43:31.093 --> 01:43:33.253
I'll watch the dance
and then go.

01:43:34.372 --> 01:43:35.853
You'll watch it too!

01:43:37.093 --> 01:43:40.613
The kols are the oldest
inhabitants of India.

01:43:41.823 --> 01:43:44.093
The Santals here are
related to this tribe.

01:43:45.613 --> 01:43:47.613
150 years ago,...

01:43:48.465 --> 01:43:51.093
... the Santals rose in
rebellion against the British.

01:43:53.768 --> 01:43:57.093
You'll come to Calcutta
to our house?

01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.613
Since you've come,
I certainly will.

01:44:04.458 --> 01:44:08.093
But not today, I'll go by
train tomorrow afternoon.

01:44:09.481 --> 01:44:11.613
I have some work here
tomorrow morning.

01:44:11.973 --> 01:44:13.808
You're coming into some
money, aren't you?

01:44:17.093 --> 01:44:18.613
Yes.

01:44:19.454 --> 01:44:22.613
Such good news and you
didn't tell us about it!

01:44:22.773 --> 01:44:24.293
There was a reason
for that.

01:44:26.325 --> 01:44:27.773
I felt,

01:44:28.732 --> 01:44:32.293
since I hadn't fulfilled
my obligation to my father,...

01:44:32.613 --> 01:44:35.613
.. I had no claim
to his property.

01:44:37.097 --> 01:44:39.613
Then I thought, such
a large sum of money...

01:44:41.778 --> 01:44:43.613
... and since my father had
made it out to me, ...

01:44:43.773 --> 01:44:45.253
... through sheer affection,
then...

01:44:45.613 --> 01:44:47.093
...why refuse money?

01:44:49.613 --> 01:44:52.146
Sit down.

01:45:01.673 --> 01:45:05.093
Breath the fresh air.
There's no more to talk about.

01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:19.613
Do you like it?
- Very much.

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:27.704
What are you waiting for?

01:48:28.889 --> 01:48:30.693
Shall I?
- By all means.

01:48:57.090 --> 01:48:59.253
You see what your niece
is up to?

01:49:02.230 --> 01:49:05.533
I have often doubted whether
she is really my niece.

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.293
Not any more.

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:29.693
Keep my suitcase as a
memento then.

01:49:31.333 --> 01:49:33.693
I grew very attached
to it.

01:49:34.971 --> 01:49:36.479
I didn't know why
you have to, ...

01:49:36.556 --> 01:49:38.653
...because you're yet to
be civilized in some respects.

01:49:39.074 --> 01:49:42.173
Very well.
Your word is law.

01:49:43.371 --> 01:49:45.495
And these note books,
you need them all?

01:49:45.705 --> 01:49:47.693
But they are my
field notes, dear

01:49:48.173 --> 01:49:51.173
I've thrown away the ones
I've no need for.

01:49:52.173 --> 01:49:55.630
Well, I'll leave them then.
You pay excess baggage.

01:49:56.173 --> 01:49:57.916
After all, you're a
millionaire.

01:49:57.992 --> 01:50:00.933
We'd all settled on coming
to the airport with you.

01:50:01.173 --> 01:50:03.173
Yes, you'd be unsettled
if you found out...

01:50:03.478 --> 01:50:06.964
... the plane was
eight hours late.

01:50:09.396 --> 01:50:11.379
You can count on the Sun
and Moon to be punctual...

01:50:11.455 --> 01:50:12.933
... but not the airlines.

01:50:17.933 --> 01:50:19.373
Take these bags downstairs.

01:50:29.173 --> 01:50:31.173
I told you to wait...

01:50:31.775 --> 01:50:33.693
... and here's your reward.

01:50:37.158 --> 01:50:41.693
It was made by the Armadillo
Cater, 1500 years ago.

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:43.693
Say thank you.
- No.

01:50:45.973 --> 01:50:48.173
There's no better thank
than that smile.

01:50:55.419 --> 01:50:57.641
I have forgotten to
tell you one thing.

01:50:57.718 --> 01:51:01.173
I've written a book.
A sort of travel book.

01:51:01.776 --> 01:51:03.693
An Indian amongst Indians.

01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:06.333
An American publisher
is bringing it out.

01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:09.693
He's given me an handsome
advance on it.

01:51:10.305 --> 01:51:13.173
Then you are really rich now.
- Indeed, I am.

01:51:18.089 --> 01:51:19.173
You'll write?

01:51:19.581 --> 01:51:22.693
What I'll do...
once I'm in my element.

01:51:23.456 --> 01:51:24.884
Just to say
you've arrived safely.

01:51:25.159 --> 01:51:26.333
That I'll do.

01:51:39.689 --> 01:51:42.173
One final duty.

01:51:45.013 --> 01:51:46.493
What is it?

01:51:47.019 --> 01:51:49.013
Have you heard of the
English word...

01:51:49.678 --> 01:51:52.273
... 'Floccinancinihili
Pilification?'

01:51:53.116 --> 01:51:56.018
Yes. I learnt it in school.

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.493
D'you know what it means?

01:52:02.018 --> 01:52:03.688
Not really.

01:52:06.493 --> 01:52:08.683
29 letters to convey
this meaning.

01:52:08.991 --> 01:52:11.013
A sure sign of civilization.

01:52:13.207 --> 01:52:15.493
Not now, let me go first.

01:52:16.045 --> 01:52:18.024
I feel very embarrassed
if someone reads...

01:52:18.348 --> 01:52:21.173
... something I've written,
in my presence.

01:52:21.996 --> 01:52:26.013
Just a few lines to
thank you for your hospitality.

01:52:29.488 --> 01:52:31.013
Well, Satyaki.

01:52:33.494 --> 01:52:35.573
It's time your Great-uncle
started on his trips.

01:52:36.656 --> 01:52:38.613
Won't you ever come back?

01:52:38.861 --> 01:52:40.808
It's your turn to come to me.

01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.493
You've promised never to
become something....

01:52:44.489 --> 01:52:48.013
.... 'Kupamunduk'.
- Don't forget.

01:52:48.349 --> 01:52:49.853
Well then.

01:52:52.403 --> 01:52:56.441
I've been most remiss, uncle.
Please forgive me.

01:52:59.013 --> 01:53:00.493
You've been remiss.

01:53:01.419 --> 01:53:04.493
Didn't I know what a serious
problem I had set for you?

01:53:05.651 --> 01:53:07.493
But there was
a reason for that.

01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:10.493
What does a
passport tell you?

01:53:11.976 --> 01:53:16.013
The name of the holder
and what he looks like.

01:53:16.493 --> 01:53:19.013
But it doesn't tell you
what the person is like.

01:53:19.493 --> 01:53:21.493
To know this,
it takes time.

01:53:21.819 --> 01:53:23.853
That time was needed.

01:53:28.493 --> 01:53:31.253
Is the touching of feet
common among of the savages?

01:53:31.596 --> 01:53:33.013
Not that I know of.

01:53:33.413 --> 01:53:36.013
Then instead of that, if...

01:53:42.379 --> 01:53:44.493
Good bye, then.

01:54:07.838 --> 01:54:10.933
Wait. Let's see
what uncle has to say.

01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:15.493
But this
is addressed to you.

01:54:15.853 --> 01:54:17.013
A poem.

01:54:18.199 --> 01:54:20.493
Blood is thicker than water

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.653
So my share goes to one...

01:54:24.459 --> 01:54:26.493
.. who's more than
my daughter.

01:54:30.426 --> 01:54:31.493
What's that?

01:54:37.643 --> 01:54:39.013
It's made out to me.

01:54:39.475 --> 01:54:41.493
And Sital's signature.

01:54:42.021 --> 01:54:43.493
Don't you see?

01:54:45.013 --> 01:54:49.693
He's willed his entire
share to you.

01:54:53.081 --> 01:54:55.013
Mr. No one
