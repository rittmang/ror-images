00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:45.799
It seems the number of educated unemployed
youth in West Bengal is over a million!

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't know how many illiterate
unemployed there are.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.719
Most of Bengal's problems have arisen from
this one big problem namely, unemployment.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.920
I'm not one of these unemployed.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.359
I've been working for a foreign
company for the last ten years.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:11.799
It's called 'Hindustan Peters',
liability of members limited.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.879
We're in the field of providing
light and wind.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.239
Peters' lamps and fans are
renowned in the market.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.760
1 200 workers are employed
in our factory in the city.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.560
We've started exporting fans.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.759
This ceiling fan will go to Iraq.
An order for 10,000 fans..

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.599
..will be sold for
Rs.1 million 200 thousand.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.080
I've no mean responsibility
in this matter.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.520
Because I'm the Sales Manager of
the Fan division of Hindustan Peters.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.319
My name is Shyamalendu Chatterji.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.960
I spent my childhood in Patna.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.960
My father was a school
teacher in Patna.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.639
We did our schooling in Patna.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.400
I was a good student. I did my Masters
in English and stood first!

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.039
After finishing my education
I followed in my father's..

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.319
..footsteps and taught
for a few days.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.800
Then I saw an advertisement in the
'First Light' for a job and applied.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.960
I got a call after a few days.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.479
I was interviewed
at the Peters' office in Patna.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.280
Hello, Mr. Chatterji!

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.599
The manager, Mr. Davidson, asked me
several questions for half an hour.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.120
I had no problem answering him.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.639
A few days later, the postman handed
me a letter bearing the Peters' mark.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.639
I had the job! Starting
salary was Rs.800.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.120
There was a month and a half
before I joined the company.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.120
In this interim, I completed
a necessary duty.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.599
The girl was called Dolan Chapa.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.520
I had studied Shakespeare from her father
Professor Bhattacharji in college.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.599
My first posting after
marriage was at Delhi.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.439
We left for Delhi from Patna
on 25th February 1 960.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.680
From that time, till today,
the 5th of March, 1 970..

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.079
.. I've progressed
so far in ten years.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.439
The secret of my success lies
in my intelligence..

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.720
..luck and my hard work.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.519
I've been successful in connecting
my company's future with mine.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.759
My concentration, intelligence
and thinking is all centered..

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.319
..around Hindustan Peters.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.720
We've been in Kolkata
since the last seven years.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.240
Initially, we lived in
a flat at Ballygunje.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.480
The company has gifted us a
residence after I became..

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.720
..the Sales Manager.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:08.800
My father has come along with my
mother to Kolkata after his retirement.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.399
I've arranged for a flat for them.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.399
We've a seven-year-old son.
We call him Raja.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.879
I've put Raja in
St. Paul's school at Darjeeling.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:34.560
He lives as a boarder there.
We visit him during the holidays.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.639
We've 180 employees
at our head-office.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:49.519
Our M.D., the managing director,
is Mr. Andrew Ferris.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.839
He was a student of Belian
College of Oxford.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.639
The Marketing Director,
Mr. Davidson is his subordinate.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.720
So, is the Finance Director, Gordon.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.720
Davidson is abroad at the moment.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.720
I hear he has cancer.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.920
Immediately below them in
hierarchy are two people..

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.040
..who are looking
up with great hope.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.839
One of them is the lamps
division sales manager..

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.199
..Ronodeb, alias Runu Sanyal.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720
The other is the fans division
sales manager..

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.240
..Shyamalendu Chatterji. That is me.

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:06.960
Thank you!

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.720
So Mr. Talukdar, what's up?

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.559
Standing next to you, I feel..

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:20.639
Why do you feel like this?

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:25.120
Your father is very tall, right?
- No.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.480
Then?
- Mother.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:28.720
Oh, mother!

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:36.080
Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Chatterji.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.080
Are you done?

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.399
Yes, it's the last page.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:40.120
Take your time.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.000
Greetings, sir!

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.279
Why is the fan on?

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.879
I didn't put it on,
I only dusted the place.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.600
You didn't put it on?
- No, sir.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:07.159
This place was quite dirty,
you polished it clean.

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:14.559
If you put on the fan unnecessarily,
the boss will cut your salary.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.480
Yes please.

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:36.720
My home phone is on the blink,
please put in a complaint.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:38.720
Certainly.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.360
Why were you surprised to see me?

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.759
You had asked me to come early.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.919
I wasn't surprised with you
but with your sense of duty.

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:50.159
I see.

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:57.759
Good morning, Mr. Chatterji!
- Good morning!

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:00.759
What can I do for you?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.679
Change your hairstyle for one thing.
I like the last one better.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.080
I'll think about it.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.879
Is the M.D. in?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.200
You want to see Mr. Ferris?

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:14.039
This is very urgent.
- All right.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.240
Good morning!
- Good morning!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.519
I was coming to see you.
- Come.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.639
The projection is at ten?
- Yes, at Roxy.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.360
We'll need around
ten minutes to get there.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.080
My only regret, we couldn't
get an Iraqi lady.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:41.159
Are you displeased? I think
she is rather attractive.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.480
It's not that. It's a question
of authenticity. Come.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.879
Is this advertisement on?
- Yes, it's all confirmed.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:49.639
That's one minute, is it?

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.159
Roughly, 100 feet.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.039
Do you find it long?

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.519
Thank you.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.279
I felt it ended abruptly.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.080
That's the desired effect you see.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.279
The impact, it has to be snappy!
- Agreed.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.919
I rather like that..
- Agreed.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.159
You know..

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.240
Yes, quite clever. Effective.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.159
By the way, you haven't met
Mr. Anand, the producer of the film.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:15.879
How are you?

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.519
Good morning!
- Good morning!

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:27.879
When did you return?

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.600
A minute back, sit.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.080
Cigarette?

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.440
What's up?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.039
What do I say?
You're the happening people!

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.120
Meaning?
- I'm right, you know.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:47.919
You may say that.
But no slogan on any street says so.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.679
I'm not speaking in general,
in the Peters' context you're king!

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:55.519
I'm glad you used the plural.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.320
There is a board meeting today,
you know.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.360
Yes, okay.

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:05.440
I had sent you a note in the morning.

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.879
Why, did I err?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.919
Stay alert, you may be sent for.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.279
Oh, no, hope they
won't ask me anything.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.039
Don't make me laugh, Mr. Chatterji.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:19.840
No, sir. I know the people here,
it's the other directors I fear.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:24.480
I've never faced them earlier.
All this time it was Davidson.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.759
He left, that is why
we're in the reckoning.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:29.360
What will the other director do?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.519
Who knows? He may ask weird questions.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.039
I'll tell you what he'll do.

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:37.480
Sir Boren will sleep most of the time.

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:42.200
Kumar Jagdish will raise
his arm if needed. Never speaks.

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:45.919
Moorty is from Delhi, you know that.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.960
Our solicitor is one.
But you've all the biggies in hand.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.120
Why fear the small timers?

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.840
I don't know.
I get this mixed feeling.

00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:01.399
It's nothing.
You're quite pleased with yourself.

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.120
You're just acting.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:12.039
You're quite lucky, I don't
think you'll be in this room for long.

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:40.039
Sir, we've reached Peters.

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:44.759
Sir, we've reached.

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.559
Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Chatterji.

00:14:56.039 --> 00:14:57.600
Are they all here? Who's it?

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:00.480
Only Mr. Boren. They'll be here soon.

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:03.639
Good morning, good morning, Chatterji!

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:06.440
How are you? How are you, my dear?

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:07.679
Fine, thank you!

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.480
Nilamber, nice to see you, my boy!

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.080
Good morning, sir. How are you?

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:15.960
Me? Fit as a fiddle
and right as the rain.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.080
God asks when am I leaving.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:22.799
I'm attending meetings!
I turned 70 in February.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:26.279
Sir, you're like your old Rolls Royce.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.039
The older it gets, the dearer it gets.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.720
I've had to fight for my due,
all my life I've fought, Nilamber.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.000
An African fighter and an
English fighter are not equals.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.559
They've had it up to
their noses taking care of..

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:48.679
..the ministers and politicians.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.840
In our times,
they had everyone under their thumb.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:00.600
If necessary they put us in jails!

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:08.000
That is why I've always
treated the British well.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.399
Good morning, everybody!

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480
Good morning, nice to see you, my boy!

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.919
Good morning!
- Good morning!

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.360
Oh, when did you arrive?

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:17.320
Last night, 1:30.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:21.480
1:30? Then you travelled from Palam.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.120
Oh, how dismal really.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120
That's how it is.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.120
I thought it was engineered
by the engineers.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.720
Kept us waiting for four hours!
So well, where are we?

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:35.799
Are you coming?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.159
In a minute, dear boy.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:44.120
Now, I remember, did I tell
you about the time with Ashim?

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.360
I think Chatterji hasn't heard.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.240
Chatterji! Did I tell you that story?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.440
No, I don't think so.

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:57.440
The war was on full spring, you know.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:06.240
Amidst that I had delayed a
Field Marshall's bill for three days!

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.519
I sent such a note that
the bill would almost be rejected.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.000
Morning!

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.200
How are you?
- Fine thank you! - Morning!

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.519
I hope you don't mind
if I go back after a while?

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.279
Because I've just started
telling them a story which..

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.319
..I haven't finished yet!

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:26.599
Don't worry about it!
Sure!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.440
So that was a really big thing!
It was really big, you know!

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.799
It went all the way up to the Viceroy!

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.799
Finally, on the Finance
Secretary's request and..

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.240
..considering the war
effort I softened my stance.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.519
Come home some day,
I'll tell you the entire episode!

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.079
You'll be amazed!

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:57.119
Look at their greatness!
Despite that incident they..

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.519
..gave me the knighthood!

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:02.440
How could they not
give it to you, sir?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.960
I'll join you too.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.839
Please send for the coffee.
- Certainly.

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.519
Don't run away!
- No.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.960
Good morning!

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.240
Good morning, sir!
- Good morning!

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.960
What's the matter?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.400
See, I'm going through exactly
the same condition as you are!

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.559
I had sent a note yesterday.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.160
They said I might be sent for today.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:49.119
I see.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.000
Want one?

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:51.920
No, thank you!
I'll stick to my simple ones!

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.880
Did you see the papers today?
- Cancer?

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:01.279
I hear they'll ban cigarette ads.
- Why?

00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:03.559
It's a gone case really.

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:06.160
They don't stop them manufacturing it.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.759
Have I seen that earlier?
- This?

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.640
Ramalingam.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.160
I see.

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:19.279
Ramalingam? So,
he is distributing rings these days!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.559
No. He said you're going
through a bad phase. Wear it.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:26.440
I told my wife.
She brought it the very next day.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.759
Excuse me, you're not needed.
You may go now.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.200
Thank you.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:08.880
Excuse me, can you please check
if my residence line is working?

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.200
Please connect me to my residence.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:17.079
Not repaired yet? Okay, leave it.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.160
See, they didn't call just me.
They had sent for Chatterji too.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.079
Really? Then?

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:24.400
What else? We waited in
the waiting room and returned.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.039
Didn't they call you in?

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:28.000
They'll call only if needed.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.680
How disappointing!

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:52.279
Chikita, Chikita!

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.119
Good evening, sir!

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.759
Are you back?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.920
When was the phone repaired?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.920
Just a while back.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:12.720
Dearest Dad and Mum, I'm fine.
I had a slight cold.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.720
I'm fine now.
My exams begin from Monday..

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.880
..that's why I'm studying very hard.

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:23.319
But I skate and play cricket too.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:30.480
Narinder's ankle broke while
trying to skate, but mine didn't.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:37.519
It's very misty here.
I like the mist but not the rain.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.720
The rain in Kolkata is nice.

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:42.960
I'm looking forward to
your visit and miss you a lot.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.039
Do write. Love and kisses from Raja.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:02.160
Did you read the letter?
- Raja's?

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.240
Not Raja's.
Your sister-in-law's, she's coming.

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.559
Who, Tutul?
- Yes.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.519
I was getting the guest room ready.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.319
When is she coming?
- Tomorrow morning.

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:13.160
The Delhi Express,
it comes in between 8 and 8:30.

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:15.039
Tomorrow morning?

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:17.160
It's not her fault, poor thing.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.480
She posted the letter on the first
and it got here today, on the fifth.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.839
It's Saturday tomorrow.
Hope you don't have to go to work.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.960
I've to drop in for a bit.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.480
I'm so happy!
She had come way back in 1961.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.799
She hasn't seen our flat.
- Jolly good!

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.000
I was sad reading Raja's letter.
- Why?

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:41.279
I felt like getting
him here right away.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.359
What are you saying?!
If you had put him in a school here..

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:49.519
..you wouldn't be so relaxed,
neither would he have studied so well.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.440
Listen, please drop me.
We've to leave at the same time.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.200
What is that boy's name?

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.960
Your aunt Tuku's sister-in-law's son.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.039
He works for Getsons.

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:17.960
Who? Prakash?

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:19.519
How about asking him tomorrow?

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:21.200
Why bother him?

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:23.279
Well, he would meet Tutul.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.759
You're mad!
- Why?

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:29.160
He is a nice boy.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.799
What's the guarantee that your sister
hasn't fallen for someone already?

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880
Never!

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.559
How do you know?

00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:37.279
Mum would've written about it.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.440
Do mothers know everything
all the time these days?

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.559
If nature has taken it's course..

00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:58.359
..by now your sister must be
a most attractive lady.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.359
That is why I was saying.

00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:06.039
Wait, what's the hurry?
She won't leave immediately.

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:09.599
How long will she stay?
- She said for about 15 days.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.720
Who could it be at this hour?

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:19.359
Whoever it is, please don't
make him sit for too long.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.480
What's up, Shushanto?

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.359
Greetings!

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.440
Sit, I'll be back in a minute.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.400
Who is it?
- Shushanto.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.839
We're leaving now..

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.039
In that case, I'll..

00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:38.880
Oh, no, please sit.
Now that you're here, sit for a bit.

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:47.799
What's up?

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:51.640
Mum sent this.
- What's that?

00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:55.839
Sir, it's nothing.
- There was no need you know.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.759
I got the job because of you.

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:02.559
How do you like your job?
- Good.

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.039
Have you made friends with everyone?
- Yes.

00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:06.960
Any problems at the factory?

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:10.480
No problems as such, sir, but..

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.480
But?

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.279
The problem at the
canteen about the fish.

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:18.240
You mean they served bad fish?
Does it stink?

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:22.119
Not really.
We settled the problem in the evening.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
Okay, if you've any problem,
do let me know.

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:31.200
Okay, bye!
- Bye!

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:34.079
Anil, we're going out,
we'll be returning late.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.680
If someone calls tell them about it.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:12.920
What do you think?

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.559
Seems like a dream.
- A nightmare?

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:24.720
No. But it has changed
so much in six years.

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:26.480
More than you?

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:28.920
He couldn't recognise you, you know.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.839
Did he know me earlier?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.839
Tutul, tell me about Patna.
I haven't been there since 1965.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.720
Your office is still there.
The one you gave your interview at.

00:27:57.599 --> 00:28:00.680
It would be. If it had
closed down I'd have heard of it.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:04.240
Do you know whisky died?
- Whisky?

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:08.359
You haven't seen him.
He was our dog. Sydney silky.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.039
He was so cute.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.440
Poor thing!
What was the matter with him?

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:14.759
Hepatitis.
He was just three years old.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:16.200
He was ill for three days and died.

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:19.519
I've been telling you
to keep a dog for since long.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.359
Why? Mrs.
Ferris did say she'd give you a dog.

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:25.440
That will be when
her dog gives a litter.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.279
Should I wait till then?

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.599
I wonder how you were
allowed to come to Kolkata!

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:36.079
Meaning?

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.119
Nobody wants to come here nowadays.

00:28:38.599 --> 00:28:40.839
I wanted to come.
- I can see that.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:44.359
I was wondering how
your parents allowed it.

00:28:45.079 --> 00:28:48.279
They thought since you're here,
there is nothing to worry.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.400
When you look at the streets
can you imagine that so..

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.039
..many people die here regularly?

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.960
Do you know any of those people?

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.000
The dying ones?

00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:58.319
No, the ones who are killing them.

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:01.039
You're mad! How will he know them?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.319
Do you? Tell me!

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.400
Have you come to meet
the revolutionaries in Kolkata?

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.359
There is a non-revolutionary.
I'll study him.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.359
That's not your task.
You need serious insights for that.

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.960
You forget I've studied psychology..

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.119
..and many other things.

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:27.960
Fortunately, there is no
way of knowing that looking at you.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.759
Keep this in the guest room.
I'll be with you in a minute.

00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:45.920
Peter's lamp! Peter's fan!

00:29:51.319 --> 00:29:52.599
Did you make it?

00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:55.400
Made in my factory. I sell them!

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.200
I've been waiting so long
to show you this flat. Nice isn't it?

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.240
Come, take a look.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.519
Wow, it's wonderful!

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:11.319
You can hear gunfire at night,
you know.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.119
Of course,
it's hard to tell which is gunfire..

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.920
..and which is the
sound of bombs going off.

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:17.480
It seems so peaceful now.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.079
That's because it's the eighth floor.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.440
I was worried about getting
a flat on the lower floors.

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:22.960
The higher floors are better.

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:26.440
There is less dust,
dirt, mosquitoes and flies.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.559
Come, I'll show you the house.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.160
You won't get scared sleeping alone?

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:35.200
Whom do I sleep with there, sister?

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:38.480
If you want you can
put on the air conditioning.

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:39.680
Of course, you've the fan too.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:41.559
No, I prefer the fan.

00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:44.359
We too can't sleep
with the windows closed.

00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:50.440
I've kept the soap and towel,
you won't need anything.

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:52.079
What is that?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.400
Wait, I'll show you.

00:30:55.319 --> 00:30:58.079
You switch this on,
that light comes on.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.319
If you open the tap after
a few minutes, you'll get hot water.

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:04.000
It won't blast I hope.
- No, silly!

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:06.480
Come.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:11.599
Is this room vacant?

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.279
Mostly. His friend
from Dhanbad had come over.

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:16.519
He stayed here for a few days.

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:17.880
What about your in-laws?

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.240
He has brought a flat for
them at Sanand road at Ballygunje.

00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:22.640
They stay there.
- Why? Why don't they live here?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.680
Don't even ask. These officers
working with foreign firms..

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.680
..have so many rules to follow.

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:29.799
They don't let them stay permanently.

00:31:30.039 --> 00:31:31.759
He said he'd fight for it.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.559
Finally father-in-law said
it'll be inconvenient for his son..

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.160
..so he'd live separately.

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:40.160
This is unfair!
Why do you've these silly rules?

00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:43.359
Hit me, go ahead, hit me.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.759
No really. 12 rooms!

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.720
I didn't think you
had made so much progress.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.400
He'll be a director soon.
- When?

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:54.319
Not sure yet. But when it happens,
it'll be a better flat!

00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:56.039
May be they won't
allow me to stay too!

00:31:56.839 --> 00:31:59.880
No way. They can't stop
the sister-in-law from staying.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.880
See you.
- Where are you going?

00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:04.240
Where else? To the office.

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:06.200
Even though he has a holiday
on Saturdays, he has to go to office.

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:09.240
I'll pick you up at a quarter to 1.
We'll have lunch at the club.

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:10.680
I've to do my hair today.

00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:14.000
All right.
I'll drop you at Eve's after lunch.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.920
Once I go to the racecourse,
I'll send you the car.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.920
Meet us once you're
done with your hairdresser.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.880
Race? Meaning?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.200
As if you don't know
the races happen on Saturdays.

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:23.640
You go to the races?!

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.160
If you don't see that,
your study will be incomplete.

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:31.920
You actually bet at the races?!

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.839
You too will bet.
But that sari won't do.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.640
Is it a bad sari?

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.640
Not worthy of you.

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:44.000
How can I wear a better sari
travelling by third class sleeper!

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:45.720
You don't need to worry about that.

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:48.279
There is no dearth of saris here.
That's my responsibility.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.880
All right, bye-bye!

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.839
Come.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.839
Sit, let's talk!

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.960
The others have been clicked
three-four years earlier.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.240
You brought it. Wait.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.400
Sit.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.799
Sister, you live in great comfort,
isn't it?

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:36.400
You will too.
You'll also get all these comforts.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.000
Your husband must
be getting a good salary!

00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:41.240
Once he is the director
he'll get 120,000.

00:33:41.839 --> 00:33:44.079
Annual salary! Did you think
it would be his monthly salary?

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.200
But he has a rival
in the lamps department.

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:49.960
There is tremendous
competition between the two.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.079
120,000!

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.839
He is quite popular in the office.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.720
He has done quite well
in the export department.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.599
Their fans are going to Iran
and Egypt and to many other places.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.079
Rabindranath Tagore
got the Nobel Prize.

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.440
He had to work quite hard for that.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.799
Plus he has to travel.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.639
He returned from the Middle
East just the other day.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.639
He is never here for
more than 20 days a month.

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:15.079
I don't understand what he does,
I don't even ask.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.519
What do you do the whole day?

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.480
This, that and the other.
I cook new dishes from cook books.

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.000
I knit, make things for my son.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.519
Sometimes, I go and catch up on the news.
- With whom?

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.599
There are many people in the office.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.800
Their wives are in
the same boat as me.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.039
Once I thought of sitting
for my Bachelor exams privately.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.480
Why didn't you?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.480
I've grown out of
the habit of studying.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.559
I don't feel like reading
anything besides magazines.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:48.039
To tell you the truth,
I think of only one thing these days.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.480
When will he become a director?

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:51.920
Of course, I worry about Raja too.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.719
I'm sure it must be nice
to get whatever you want.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.679
There is a nice, suitable boy for you.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.000
He works for the government.
Want to meet him?

00:35:03.199 --> 00:35:06.519
You'll teach like father, right?
Or will you work?

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:11.000
I haven't decided anything yet.

00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:43.159
I had no idea there was
a place like this in Kolkata.

00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:46.480
I like this club,
the others are so gloomy.

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:49.760
You wouldn't have gotten
entry here ten years back.

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:52.119
Was it only for the British?
- Exclusive!

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.880
You mean there is no difference
in the British and Indians now?

00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:57.480
Differences due to the
skin colour will always remain.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.880
But differences in privileges
have lessened considerably.

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:01.760
Is that good or bad?

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.440
You ask the weirdest of questions.

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:04.719
Why? I'm just asking.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.960
Does your brother
Shyamal know everything?

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:07.280
He surely knows better than me!

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.800
He holds a big post at work!

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.239
It's not a question of good or bad.

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:15.920
The thing is that an artificial
barrier has been removed.

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:19.360
That's all. Now, each one will find
his own space according to his station.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.840
What do you mean?

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:23.039
Station, meaning position, ability.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.480
Ability to do what?

00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:26.079
Tutul!

00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:28.280
Oh, no!

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:37.840
How are you? Good morning!

00:36:38.039 --> 00:36:39.559
Good morning!
- Good morning!

00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:41.320
Good morning! Hope you're fine, dear?

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:44.639
Let me introduce you. Sir Boren Roy.

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:46.440
My sister-in-law, Sudarshana.

00:36:46.519 --> 00:36:49.400
Sudarshana, Sudarshana!

00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:52.840
How appropriate!

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:54.800
She has come from Patna today.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.480
You've come today?! How sensible!

00:36:58.559 --> 00:37:00.840
Darling, you'll stay
for a few days, right?

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:08.800
I may be 70 years old,
but I still have sharp eyes!

00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:14.920
Or else why would I zero
in on your table from a distance.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.920
Have a good day!

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.519
Who is he?
- Oh, a big shot!

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.280
Sir Boren Roy.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:27.800
He is one of the directors
of their company.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.280
He is quite scary, isn't it?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.880
He is quite harmless really.

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:37.679
He is staring at me!

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.880
Maybe he likes you.

00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:44.719
Unfortunately, you're not the
only woman he stares at like this!

00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:49.920
He is still staring at me!
Without blinking!

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.519
Now, don't you stare back!

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.320
Even if I don't,
I know he is staring at me.

00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:57.719
If senior citizens behave like this,
imagine what younger men will go through?

00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:02.400
What a director! Will you also
do this once you become a director?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.320
I won't stare at all girls.
That I can guarantee you.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.800
Oh, such a saint!
God knows what he does with his wife!

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:11.000
Is she a beauty?

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:14.280
Come to our office some day.
I'll introduce you.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.079
Oh, no. He won't allow
me to eat in peace.

00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:33.239
I'll see you. Do send the car.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.159
I'll just have a look.
Just for a minute.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.800
I'll give you two minutes.

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:45.119
Here is Chrysanthemum!
This is a nice name for a horse!

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.119
You don't bet on a horse
because of his name! - I do!

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.159
How much will I get if I win?

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.000
For Rs.10 you'll get Rs.60.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.119
Is that good or bad?

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.039
What do you think?
- It's great.

00:40:58.599 --> 00:40:59.719
Well then, it's great.

00:41:02.719 --> 00:41:06.239
How will I know which one is my horse?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.199
There, they have numbers.
Your number is six.

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:14.559
Six! My birth date.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.719
Hello!
- Who?

00:41:21.039 --> 00:41:22.880
Mr. Ferris. M.D.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.480
A doctor?

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:26.920
Managing Director.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.280
The other person is Mr.
Gordon, Finance Director.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.039
F.D.
- All right, F.D.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.519
Oh, dear! What if I burst a bomb here!

00:41:44.519 --> 00:41:46.159
Here we go.
- Where?

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.119
There.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.159
What happened?
- It's over.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.800
And mine?

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.960
Second, no. 3 is first.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.519
I'll bet again.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.639
One moment.

00:43:04.519 --> 00:43:06.000
Look at your sister-in-law!

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.119
What happened? You're tongue-tied!

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.320
Hope I married the right sister!
I've my doubts now.

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:28.719
If so, divorce me.

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:32.800
Divorce? You need grounds for that.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.880
Fine. I'll look for reasons.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.440
How about mental cruelty?
That will save my skin.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.280
Wonderful conversation.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:56.400
I've thought about it.
You've to have sherry today.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.159
Not at all.

00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:03.320
Why? Your sister can have it,
why can't you?

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.440
As if I'm the only one who drinks.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.400
I'm not a sales manager's wife.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.920
I'll sit here and watch.
- And study?

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.519
I've heard you drink a lot.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.400
Oh. You seem to have sung paeans
of my qualities to your sister.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.559
I only told her the truth.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.400
I'll see you drunk.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.280
I don't touch drinks except at home.

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:37.639
No it's not that.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.800
The gentleman hadn't
seen the lady before that.

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:44.519
Just took one look at the lady.
Then he said..

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.599
Thank you!

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.199
Then he said you're ill.

00:44:51.639 --> 00:44:53.880
And he described the
symptoms of epilepsy.

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:56.679
Then the lady said, right, it matches.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.000
The gentleman said,
oh, it's fine. Then..

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.039
Meaning?

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:06.079
What was it?
- A locket.

00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:07.800
It was in his hands?

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.239
A gold locket. Not an ordinary one.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.159
And not just any locket you know.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.079
The gentleman's picture
on one face and his guru's..

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.679
..picture on the other face.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.840
Then?

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.320
The gentleman said, put this on.
You won't get any more fits.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.000
And I noticed for a fact that after
that, the lady didn't have any fits.

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.559
Did you see it up close?

00:45:25.639 --> 00:45:29.119
Not just him, I saw it too.
It was quite big and heavy.

00:45:29.199 --> 00:45:32.480
It's not just one or two cases. There
are thousands of cases like this.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.239
It certainly makes you think.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.440
So, now you're his follower, Ronu?

00:45:37.519 --> 00:45:40.159
I don't know about that.
I'm telling you what I saw.

00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:43.280
If he is so capable,
let him cure our city of all ills.

00:45:43.679 --> 00:45:44.920
What are you saying, Dolon?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.960
A mendicant and cure our city!

00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:49.800
This chap seems hardly human.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.119
He sounds more like a god!

00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:54.679
So what if he does.
This city is doomed!

00:45:55.039 --> 00:45:56.760
That means there is no way out?

00:45:57.199 --> 00:46:00.159
There is. Give the boys employment.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.920
Where will you get so many vacancies?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.840
What's the use even
if you give them jobs?

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.599
They'll form unions.
And then you deal with that.

00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:10.360
But is it only about jobs?

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.679
They're saying the
whole system is rotten.

00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:20.159
I don't think they want jobs.

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:21.440
They want revolution.

00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:22.920
We need a dictator.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.599
Our young men don't trust anything.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.760
Samar, it's a universal thing.

00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:29.800
Universal, my foot!

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.519
They are doing it abroad.
And we follow them.

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:34.880
They do it, we do it too.

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:39.960
We haven't stopped aping them
25 years after independence!

00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:43.199
They don't understand
independence the way we do.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.960
This is the
post-independence generation.

00:46:46.039 --> 00:46:47.880
I hope you're not
trying to defend them.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.000
That's a generation gap,
you won't understand that.

00:46:50.199 --> 00:46:51.880
I do, I most certainly do!

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.800
Mullick, why are you so quiet?
How about some witticisms?

00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:04.239
You've a lot of experience with
the labour class. Let us hear some.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.920
You all know I'm an admirer of beauty.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.440
You've made me sit in front
of someone who has me tongue-tied.

00:47:14.239 --> 00:47:16.280
Is this admiration or something else?

00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:18.719
You can't admire sitting on the sofa.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.119
Sit on the floor, at her feet.

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:22.719
Yes, that is your seat.

00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:28.639
Certainly! Certainly, with pleasure!

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.280
Would you like a sherry?

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.159
I don't need it.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.760
Sir, mother and father
have come from Ballygunje.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.679
Don't you have a man
in the elevator here?

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.000
No, the lift is..

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:57.320
Bless you, my dear.

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:01.400
I looked here and there and wondered.

00:48:01.639 --> 00:48:04.920
You had mentioned the eighth floor,
so I pressed eight.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.639
Did you come in the express lift?

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.960
When I saw a Madrasi
name on your door..

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.039
Come. Come, Mother.

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:25.199
Come.

00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:26.559
Sit, Mother.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.360
There are so many guests here.

00:48:31.679 --> 00:48:33.320
So what, please sit!

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.079
I've been meaning
to come for many days.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.280
They're my friends.

00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:45.199
My sister has come
from Patna today. Tutul.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.519
Is that right?

00:48:51.559 --> 00:48:52.679
I'm sorry.

00:48:57.559 --> 00:48:59.960
Bless you, dear.
- She has passed her Masters this year.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.079
You go, I'll sit here.

00:49:02.159 --> 00:49:03.920
Please have some sweets and go.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.039
Don't worry, dear. It's okay.

00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:09.400
You've grown up, dear!

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.679
Mother talks a lot about you.

00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:22.159
So many memories,
I sit and think back of those days.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.360
My sister-in-law bet at the
races for the first time today.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.960
She won Rs. 19.

00:49:33.239 --> 00:49:34.119
Beginners' luck.

00:50:43.679 --> 00:50:44.840
Good morning!

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.519
How about some tea?

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.480
If you have some.

00:50:57.639 --> 00:50:58.880
Anil.
- Yes sir.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.039
Two cups of tea.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.800
Are you an early riser?

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.840
I was awake, I didn't have a watch.
So I got up.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.320
Just a minute.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.039
This is my watch.
I had given it to your sister.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.519
She doesn't use it.

00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:41.800
Return it to me when you leave,
that'll be fine.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960
Thank you!

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.199
Is there something strange here?
- Why?

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:24.199
You must be thinking,
Shyamal's life is so facile.

00:52:25.239 --> 00:52:27.280
I don't come to conclusions so easily.

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:29.039
Let me observe some more.

00:52:39.559 --> 00:52:44.320
When I was in school,
we had a few subjects.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.039
Like geography.
I disliked it immensely.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.039
But I couldn't avoid those because
they were a part of the syllabus.

00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:56.639
You're saying you still
have to do things you don't like.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.000
Right?

00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:03.840
Else, one stagnates.
There is no promotion. Is that good?

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:14.800
Fine. When you go for parties,
I'll arrange your books.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.400
They're very untidy.

00:53:20.239 --> 00:53:21.440
As long as you're here..

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.159
..we won't go to a party
unless it's absolutely important.

00:53:26.199 --> 00:53:30.079
You disappointed me yesterday.
- Why?

00:53:31.519 --> 00:53:32.920
You were a martyr.

00:53:34.519 --> 00:53:36.039
Not everyone is a martyr.

00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:37.960
You don't drink so much.

00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:49.320
You should know there
is something called conflict.

00:53:51.159 --> 00:53:52.760
I can't argue with a rival like you.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.239
Why? Can you drink a lot?

00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:04.400
A lot of your qualities
got left behind in Patna.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.280
Your moustache has gone,
your glasses have changed.

00:54:08.599 --> 00:54:10.039
Many other things have changed.

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:19.599
That's all?
- That's all.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.719
Is that good or bad?

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.360
You are keeping mum.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.320
Hasn't sister gotten up?

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.920
She doesn't get up before 9.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.480
And you?

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.800
Do you rise so early on Sundays too?

00:55:05.079 --> 00:55:09.519
Earlier than this. I play golf.
- Golf?

00:55:11.159 --> 00:55:12.159
Golf.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.440
That too is geography.

00:55:15.199 --> 00:55:16.519
You didn't go today.

00:55:22.639 --> 00:55:25.840
I feel like listening to the Sitar
( stringed instrument) and clarinet today.

00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:30.559
What are we doing today?

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.519
Anything you wish.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.280
I'll show you something.
- What?

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.000
Let's get there first.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.199
You'll have to get out of the car.
If you don't mind.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.119
Do we've to get off?

00:56:47.199 --> 00:56:50.719
What's this?
Is this the way your fans work?

00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:12.280
Good morning, Mr. Ramalingam!

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.000
Good morning, Mr. Chatterji!

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.559
How come you're so late today?

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.719
I'm getting old, so I take
a little longer on my feet. - Come.

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:26.000
What about the compassion that
you're showing toward all colleagues?

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:28.719
What are you saying?
How about giving me a ring?

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.719
He first wore it.
How did he do it so fast?

00:57:32.159 --> 00:57:33.920
His wife did it.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.559
True. Do you need a ring, Mr.
Chatterji?

00:57:38.199 --> 00:57:40.800
A star sapphire will suit you now?
- Really?

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.719
Yes!

00:57:46.199 --> 00:57:52.440
Chatterji, I'll be retiring
after six months. - I know.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.000
After you leave the salary
department we will really miss you.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.679
Before I go, I've got something
very precious to show you.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.599
Have you got it with you?
- Yes.

00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:02.400
Please sit.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.079
This is my father's letter.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.360
It's written in 1932,
when I first joined this firm.

00:58:38.679 --> 00:58:40.480
The English language is like fire.

00:58:40.639 --> 00:58:42.480
Oh dear, this is in Tamil.

00:58:43.159 --> 00:58:46.320
The English are like fire.
- Like fire? Very well.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.079
If you're too far away you
won't get the warmth of the fire.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400
What does that mean?

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.719
If you're too far away you
won't get the warmth of the fire.

00:58:57.199 --> 00:58:58.840
Won't get it?
- Right.

00:58:59.519 --> 00:59:03.559
Listen. If you are..
too near you'll get scorched.

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.840
You mean?
- If you're too near..

00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:08.519
You'll get singed!

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.599
Oh, you mean one will get scorched?
- Yes.

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:18.480
So one shouldn't
go too far or too near.

00:59:19.079 --> 00:59:21.360
So one shouldn't
go too far or too near.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.039
One should be at a medium distance.

00:59:23.119 --> 00:59:24.320
That's right, that's right!

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.239
Have I gone too close or what?
Have I been singed?

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:32.719
How do I tell you, Mr. Chatterji?

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:38.719
What has to happen can't be uttered,
you've to feel it.

00:59:39.079 --> 00:59:40.840
You mean in my heart?

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.599
You're very ambitious, Mr.
Chatterji, very ambitious.

00:59:45.679 --> 00:59:48.760
Mr. Ramalingam,
one can't move ahead without that.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.199
I'm not saying ambition is a bad thing.
- Thank God!

00:59:52.559 --> 00:59:54.719
I thought my entire
life has been a sham.

00:59:55.039 --> 01:00:00.239
All ambitions are awful
except those which climb upwards..

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:03.599
..on the miseries and
credibility of mankind.

01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:06.679
Joseph Conrad.
Have you read it, Mr. Chatterji?

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.880
Mr. Ramalingam,
you're a very learned man.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.719
That is why I'm nothing! I only have a
great stock of other people's wisdom.

01:00:16.159 --> 01:00:17.800
My feud bourgeois.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.840
Sen here.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:26.599
Is there a problem at Park Street?
- Problem?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.440
Yes. There is no coordination
in the funny animation.

01:00:29.519 --> 01:00:30.920
It's ridiculous.

01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:34.920
I see. I'll arrange to have it repaired.
- Please.

01:00:36.519 --> 01:00:38.280
Good morning!
- Good morning!

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.920
How was your weekend?
- Good.

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:44.920
Will your husband allow
you to work after marriage?

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.800
Or I'll have problems.

01:00:47.079 --> 01:00:49.519
I'll tell him.
- Is that a promise?

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920
All right.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.719
Chatterji. What! What are you saying?

01:00:58.719 --> 01:01:00.280
The goods have to be
shipped out in a week and..

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.079
Didn't anyone notice
it all these days? No.

01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:20.679
Sen.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.199
That document won't be out.
- Which one?

01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:25.039
Export act.

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:28.039
Please hold it. Send them a telex,
call them anything. Do something.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400
Please.

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:35.039
Ms. D'souza would you connect
me to Mr. Ferris please.

01:01:35.119 --> 01:01:36.320
I'd like to speak to him.

01:01:45.079 --> 01:01:47.519
Mr. Ferris, Mr.
Chatterji would like to see you.

01:01:49.719 --> 01:01:50.599
Go in please.

01:01:52.599 --> 01:01:54.119
Good morning, Mr. Ferris.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.960
Good morning, Chatterji, come on in.

01:01:58.679 --> 01:01:59.760
Gordon.

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:02.800
Right away, Andrew.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.800
What is the matter?
It's 1:30, he has never done this.

01:02:16.679 --> 01:02:18.239
Can't you call him?

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.440
I'm feeling quite hungry.

01:02:21.559 --> 01:02:23.800
Ask that gentleman
if we can make a call.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.960
Could I use your telephone please?
- Yes ma'am, this way.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.239
Chatterji.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.079
You're still in the office?!

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:52.760
Oh no! I'm extremely sorry.

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:55.119
I'm tied up with
something important here.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.840
So you aren't coming?

01:02:57.199 --> 01:03:00.800
I simply can't.
I'm hopelessly tied up.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.559
Poor Tutul,
she has been waiting for so long.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.440
Tell Tutul this won't
ever happen again.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.719
We'll go ahead and eat then.
- Please.

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.320
After this, we're going for a movie.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.559
We're just the two of us.
No need to send the car.

01:03:14.639 --> 01:03:16.719
We'll take a taxi.
- All right.

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:25.960
He can't come. He is tied
up with something important.

01:03:26.159 --> 01:03:27.679
Let's eat.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.599
Is madam back yet?
- No, sir.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.239
Oh, good, you're back.
You know what happened to us?

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.639
We didn't get the tickets.
What did we do then?

01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:46.199
We went to the market.
Then we went to Schillers.

01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:48.000
Then we went to Cottage Industries.

01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:51.639
We had tea at Trinka's.
It took us half an hour to get a taxi.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:57.239
It's so hot. I'll have a shower and come.
- Okay.

01:05:00.119 --> 01:05:01.639
Tutul, won't you have a shower?

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.719
Yes, I'll.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.400
If you knew the actual reason,
you wouldn't be so upset.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.119
Tell me the reason. Explain it to me.

01:05:18.199 --> 01:05:19.960
It's not possible right now.

01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:41.559
Tell me, professor.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.679
What's today's date?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.199
Eighth.
- Eighth?

01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:59.880
On the 15th, we have to send
a huge consignment of fans to Iraq.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.880
It's big money.
It's very prestigious too.

01:06:05.239 --> 01:06:11.000
The factory informed me today,
there is a defect in the fans.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.679
What defect?

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.079
You see that cover at the bottom?

01:06:16.719 --> 01:06:20.320
The paint on it hasn't spread evenly.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.400
There are wrinkles on it.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.320
If we send the fans
in this condition..

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.880
..the entire consignment
will be rejected and returned.

01:06:29.079 --> 01:06:30.519
Can't it be rectified?

01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:35.079
It can be.
But it'll take a lot of time.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.559
At least three weeks.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:46.559
As a result, number one,
we've to pay a heavy penalty.

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:54.440
Number two, we won't have any
prestige left in the export market.

01:06:55.719 --> 01:07:01.360
Number three.
I'm the manager of the fans division.

01:07:03.679 --> 01:07:07.599
This entire export consignment
was my responsibility.

01:07:11.079 --> 01:07:12.440
Understand?

01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:17.159
I see. You had reason to worry.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:21.960
So, it's not my fault.
It's yours. Isn't it?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.599
Agreed. But is there no way out?

01:07:28.239 --> 01:07:32.840
There is. Imagine if there
is a terrible earthquake or..

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.679
..an epidemic or a flood.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.079
Ones that are called
'acts of God' in this context.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:48.159
Acts of God? That's strange!
But will God act for you?

01:07:50.159 --> 01:07:51.119
I don't think so.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.440
If there was some
problem at the factory?

01:07:55.199 --> 01:07:59.079
If work came to a halt,
we would've got some time.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.920
I would have got some respite.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.880
Then start a problem!
You can do anything.

01:08:07.239 --> 01:08:08.320
Sorry, sorry!

01:08:09.159 --> 01:08:12.239
What do you think
of your brother Shyamal?

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.880
I've erred. Forgive me.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.279
But when there is a way,
why do you think so much?

01:08:17.119 --> 01:08:18.520
I'm not thinking now.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.479
I see.

01:08:21.199 --> 01:08:22.239
What are you doing?

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:24.239
Correct! I forgot to tell you..

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:26.720
..we don't need to look for
a suitable boy for your sister-in-law.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.319
Meaning?
- Should I tell?

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.439
Tell him.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.560
She has a boyfriend in Patna.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.680
She got a ten-page letter today!

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.520
I probed and found out everything.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.960
He was a year senior to
her in college, he is a Boddi.

01:08:40.039 --> 01:08:42.000
He isn't working yet.

01:08:45.119 --> 01:08:46.439
Didn't I tell you!

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.079
I'm the only one
giving all explanations.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:59.119
You won't tell me a thing?

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.399
What do you want to know?

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.039
At least tell me about the boy.

01:09:08.119 --> 01:09:11.720
Intellectual? Intelligent?

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.720
You could say that.

01:09:15.039 --> 01:09:17.760
Revolutionary?
- Sort of.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.039
The future is dark.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.800
I wouldn't call it dark.
It's uncertain.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.479
Is that good or bad?

01:09:31.079 --> 01:09:32.000
I don't know.

01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:35.720
First love?
- Whose?

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:37.199
Yours.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.640
A personal question.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.039
The other day that boy got
some sweets we haven't eaten them.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.680
It's made of fresh jaggery, want some?

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.720
How about you?

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.239
I protest. I should've
been told about this earlier.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.640
You're too much!

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.439
Should she come and tell you as soon as
she arrives that she has a boyfriend.

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.600
What are you looking for?

01:10:13.159 --> 01:10:14.319
My glasses.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.119
Good night!

01:10:59.319 --> 01:11:01.119
What happened at your office?

01:11:04.039 --> 01:11:05.119
What is the problem?

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:11.239
That export matter.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.239
Hope it's not too serious.
- No.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.319
Tutul has made such a blunder.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.239
She doesn't listen to me.
You talk to her.

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:34.960
If she gets too involved with just
about anybody, she'll be in a problem.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.000
Hello!
- Mr. Talukdar?

01:12:55.239 --> 01:12:57.159
Yes.
- I'm Chatterji speaking.

01:12:57.359 --> 01:12:58.760
What's up?

01:12:59.279 --> 01:13:00.399
Did I wake you up?

01:13:00.479 --> 01:13:02.600
Oh no, the night's still young!

01:13:03.119 --> 01:13:08.119
I had some work with you.
- Is it urgent?

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.039
Or why would I call at this time?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.199
Should I come over?
- What if I do?

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.319
That'll be my good fortune!

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.840
Fine, give me ten minutes.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.760
I had a marriage invitation today.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:28.439
I returned just ten
minutes before your call.

01:13:29.079 --> 01:13:31.840
Of course,
I never sleep before midnight.

01:13:33.399 --> 01:13:34.800
What is it?

01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:38.399
How is the factory doing?

01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:42.479
Factory? You mean your factory?
- Naturally.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.159
It's fine!

01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:52.039
Wasn't there a problem three days ago?
- No.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.359
I thought there was
some problem at the canteen.

01:13:55.439 --> 01:13:58.039
That was a trivial matter!
It seems the fish pieces were small!

01:13:58.399 --> 01:14:00.560
That was solved in half an hour.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.880
So, there is no tension right now?

01:14:08.439 --> 01:14:09.560
Not that I know of.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.760
Of course,
God alone knows what goes on inside!

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:17.600
What's the matter?
You seem a bit out of sorts.

01:14:19.359 --> 01:14:22.000
Do you want tension?

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.520
Haven't you heard of the export crisis?
- Crisis?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.159
Goods are ready.

01:14:27.479 --> 01:14:30.399
The goods aren't going.
They're defective.

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:33.520
There was a problem with the dye.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.000
That is why there are
wrinkles in the surface.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.279
It can be seen from
a distance of three feet!

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.079
The whole thing makes
me absolutely sick.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.920
The goods are supposed
to be shipped on the 15th.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.119
There is a penalty clause.
The party won't extend the L.C.

01:14:51.199 --> 01:14:52.600
Oh, father!

01:14:53.039 --> 01:14:55.760
It's really a distressing matter!

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.439
The account books will show red,
brother.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.119
I don't recall Peter's company
facing a situation like this ever.

01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:06.000
There is a way.
- You think so?

01:15:07.359 --> 01:15:11.760
But that's not in my sphere.

01:15:12.439 --> 01:15:15.239
I mean, I'm not used
to walking that path.

01:15:15.319 --> 01:15:17.239
Then whose area is it? Mine?

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.199
Actually, you've more
experience in this matter.

01:15:20.279 --> 01:15:24.159
Plus, you've a certain
connection with the factory.

01:15:25.159 --> 01:15:26.159
Hope you don't mind.

01:15:26.239 --> 01:15:28.359
There is no scope to mind,
I don't understand anything.

01:15:29.239 --> 01:15:29.960
Don't get it?

01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:33.079
No. Please tell me a little
more clearly, just a bit more.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.399
If the factory shuts down
due to unseen circumstances..

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560
..I won't have to give
any penalty or explanations.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.359
I'll get some time in hand
and will manage the matter.

01:15:46.079 --> 01:15:47.239
Got it?

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:05.399
Mister, all along we envied
you your height, your smile..

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:08.560
..and your sharp personality.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.319
But that you possess
this quality too..

01:16:12.399 --> 01:16:14.159
Mr. Talukdar, let's face it!

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.840
Both of us know that there
is no way other than this.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:21.399
I get it, Mr. Chatterji.
Only you don't understand one thing.

01:16:22.039 --> 01:16:26.680
I've been through a lot.
All for this Peter's company.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.760
But no one ever bothered
about my compensation.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.920
Listen..
- What is there to listen?

01:16:33.159 --> 01:16:34.640
I've been working for 23 years.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.279
Now, I may be a personnel officer,
but for 1 3 years, I was a labour officer.

01:16:39.359 --> 01:16:40.960
I'm tired of listening.

01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:42.720
Whatever that is, listen to me.

01:16:43.119 --> 01:16:45.079
What is being done will continue.

01:16:45.159 --> 01:16:46.840
It'll be done with the M.D's consent.

01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:49.880
I'll tell him that you helped me.

01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:51.920
Exactly! I'm helping you!

01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:53.439
But you've to tell him how much
I've helped you.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.119
Not just tell him but
he also must realise it!

01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:56.520
It needs to be appreciated.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.880
I guarantee you..

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.800
..first thing in the morning,
I'll meet the Managing Director.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.960
I'll tell him I see a
way and we want to apply it.

01:17:06.239 --> 01:17:08.079
If it works, fine, or forget it.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.199
There is no reason for it not to work,
especially because..

01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:18.239
..this history has
been found three days back.

01:17:19.279 --> 01:17:23.680
Today is the eighth, tomorrow..

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.439
..the ninth, Tuesday.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.560
By the 15th, you've to..

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.880
Are you relying on the canteen affair?

01:17:33.159 --> 01:17:36.159
We need a starting point.

01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:37.840
We've very little time.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.840
Yes. I too will get to
work first thing in the morning.

01:17:43.399 --> 01:17:49.039
But one thing,
I can't accept your compliment.

01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:52.800
Just like you don't walk this path..

01:17:53.319 --> 01:17:55.920
..I too don't walk this path, Mr.
Chatterji.

01:17:56.359 --> 01:17:59.520
There are other people
for this. Get it?

01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:07.199
See this hand?
It has always stayed clean!

01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:16.640
Good morning, Mr.
Chatterji, come on in.

01:18:18.079 --> 01:18:22.520
Mr. Ferris, I think I've
found a way to save the situation.

01:18:23.239 --> 01:18:26.399
You do, do you?
Sit down, sit down. Tell me about it.

01:19:05.439 --> 01:19:06.239
The cover is open.

01:19:06.319 --> 01:19:10.680
"If you want a good
fan buy Peter's fan."

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:17.840
"Let the wonderful breeze
freshen you up entirely."

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.359
"Buy Peter's fan!"

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.000
"A good fan, the best fan.
Buy Peter's fan."

01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:32.960
"Cool, cool breeze
lets you relax completely."

01:19:33.039 --> 01:19:35.520
"Buy Peter's fan!"

01:19:47.159 --> 01:19:49.680
Number so and so, dated so and so.

01:19:51.039 --> 01:19:53.560
I was delighted to note..

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.359
..that your clients have expressed
satisfaction with our ceiling fans.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.960
With kind regards to Mrs.
Siddique and yourself.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.000
Yours etcetera.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.000
Are you feeling unwell?

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:18.319
No. I'm okay, just a slight headache.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.159
I've an Aspro, should I give you?

01:21:20.239 --> 01:21:21.800
I won't need it, thank you!

01:21:52.039 --> 01:21:53.960
Tell me.
- What?

01:21:54.279 --> 01:21:55.800
You ask me what?

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.039
Its fine, it's fine.

01:22:01.359 --> 01:22:02.520
It's nerve racking.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.920
It's nothing, mister, nothing!

01:22:04.479 --> 01:22:08.159
You aren't used to it so
you feel bad about it.

01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:10.119
All this is part of the game.

01:22:13.239 --> 01:22:15.960
We had no other way out.

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:18.079
Was there?

01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:19.880
You got your finger
on the pulse all right.

01:22:20.079 --> 01:22:22.840
Besides,
this is common practice, mister.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.279
What you're doing is
not unjust or unnatural.

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:31.279
But if you slip up,
the cat will be out of the bag.

01:22:31.359 --> 01:22:32.239
What do you mean?

01:22:32.319 --> 01:22:34.600
If we don't cover all fronts
how will the strategy work!

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.720
Your job now is to simply keep going.
No compromise.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.520
Production must go on.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.199
The company won't tolerate
any misbehaviour. That's all!

01:22:44.279 --> 01:22:48.479
Now, the matter will go to the High
Court before the impasse is broken.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:51.960
Go medium, go slow, production stop.

01:22:52.119 --> 01:22:52.920
Charge sheet.

01:22:53.159 --> 01:22:54.640
A couple of bombs.
- Bomb?

01:22:55.399 --> 01:22:56.840
You want police action, right?

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.680
Your deadline is the 15th.
You need a reason for the lock out.

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:05.000
There are chances that
the machinery might be damaged.

01:23:05.079 --> 01:23:06.760
You can't do without
a situation like this.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
After that you'll of course negotiate.

01:23:09.239 --> 01:23:11.720
You can make one or
two concessions that time.

01:23:12.039 --> 01:23:13.239
This way, the problem is solved.

01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:15.239
After all, the onus is on you.

01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:18.319
On us!

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.279
Excuse me!
- Now what!

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.600
Can I relax?
- 500%

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.000
Want more? No.

01:23:27.399 --> 01:23:28.479
Oh, sorry.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.840
Ask her to come.

01:23:50.039 --> 01:23:51.399
Welcome to Hindustan Peters.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.479
You probably didn't
think I'd really come.

01:23:55.479 --> 01:23:58.880
You've some time in hand, right?
- Half an hour.

01:23:59.399 --> 01:24:01.119
Sister is waiting at Mahadev's shop.

01:24:02.359 --> 01:24:03.960
I'm leaving.
- Good night!

01:24:04.159 --> 01:24:05.520
Oh, let me introduce you.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.520
Ms. Pavit, my secretary.
Ms. Bhattacharji, my wife's sister.

01:24:10.039 --> 01:24:11.760
Good night!
- Good night! Good night!

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.640
Do you like her?

01:24:15.119 --> 01:24:16.720
As long as you like it.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.479
She is getting married soon.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.920
Thank God!

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.000
Wait, I'll be back in a minute.

01:24:38.119 --> 01:24:40.079
Come, let me show you the real room.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.319
Our directors' meetings are held here.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.039
Only directors?

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.079
That means you too attend it?
- So far yes.

01:25:07.359 --> 01:25:09.159
Isn't it a good room?

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.800
The room is okay.

01:25:12.119 --> 01:25:13.279
What is wrong?

01:25:14.199 --> 01:25:17.039
I'm trying to figure out
what is it about this room..

01:25:17.119 --> 01:25:18.560
..that attracts you so much.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:26.319
You won't understand that.
Don't even try to understand.

01:25:26.399 --> 01:25:29.079
And it can't really be explained.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.079
Actually, I too didn't
have this feeling before.

01:25:33.439 --> 01:25:39.239
Then I realised the room
is reaching out to me slowly.

01:25:41.319 --> 01:25:44.319
Race jockeys probably feel like that.

01:25:45.479 --> 01:25:48.199
When they see the
winning post coming near.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.359
If there is another rival close by..

01:25:53.159 --> 01:25:55.039
..you can understand
what kind of tension there is.

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:58.000
It seems quite dangerous
listening to you.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.720
That it is for sure.
You stumble time and again.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.039
You fall on your face.

01:26:06.079 --> 01:26:09.039
To the extent that
one makes fouls too.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.039
Suddenly, I thought of
the day when you came to our..

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.920
..house in Patna for the first time.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.960
You had worn a brown khadi shirt.
And loose pants.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:32.760
Your cycle was left leaning
on the Shimul tree by our gate.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.159
Sister looked at you from
the chink in the curtains.

01:26:36.479 --> 01:26:40.159
She said, may be he is feeling shy.
Go call him.

01:26:47.319 --> 01:26:49.520
You were wearing a frock.
- Sari.

01:26:50.399 --> 01:26:51.680
In your honour.

01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:54.239
Of course you're not
supposed to know that.

01:26:54.439 --> 01:26:56.399
You didn't even look at me that day.

01:26:58.039 --> 01:27:01.239
Was that correct?
I would've asked for your hand.

01:27:01.319 --> 01:27:02.960
Just think how little
you were that time.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.119
Father used to talk about
you often at the dinner table.

01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:07.720
He was so proud of you.

01:27:08.359 --> 01:27:11.560
He used to say, I'll never
get such a good student again.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.399
And you listened?

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.119
And envied sister.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.319
Don't you do so now?

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.760
I had so many apprehensions
before coming to Kolkata this time.

01:27:26.319 --> 01:27:29.079
May be I'd find you've
changed into someone horrible.

01:27:29.159 --> 01:27:31.520
Very conceited, drinking all night..

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.319
As they say in Bengali,
so many more vices.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.680
Why didn't you tell me
about your boyfriend before?

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.720
I would've if there
was something worth saying.

01:27:53.319 --> 01:27:54.439
Are you speaking the truth?

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.039
Why would I lie?

01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:01.960
Do you've to leave on the 20th?
- I'll come again.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.840
Give me a job in your office,
I'll come back.

01:28:05.479 --> 01:28:06.760
Okay, done.

01:28:13.039 --> 01:28:18.880
I hadn't imagined the strike
would catch on so fast and..

01:28:19.399 --> 01:28:20.680
..so many people would strike.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.199
The next day, 10th of March,
the workers used a unique..

01:28:24.279 --> 01:28:27.760
..way of showing their
protest and anger..

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.199
..toward the managers.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.439
On the 11th March I discussed
with Ferris and it was decided..

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.520
..that the company wouldn't
tolerate any form of indiscipline.

01:28:41.279 --> 01:28:43.720
Reduction of production
was unacceptable.

01:28:45.279 --> 01:28:47.920
That day itself, the workers views..

01:28:48.199 --> 01:28:50.399
..were displayed on
the factory's outer walls.

01:28:51.439 --> 01:28:54.680
And inside the factory,
the worker's began their agitation.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.039
Sign.. News of the trouble
reached the head office.

01:29:03.439 --> 01:29:06.359
But no one except Ferris, Talukdar..

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.319
..and me knew what
the actual truth was.

01:29:08.399 --> 01:29:10.439
Hey, dear! Listen, there is hot news!

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.520
What happened?

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.920
There is trouble in the fan works!

01:29:13.079 --> 01:29:14.039
Trouble, meaning?

01:29:14.239 --> 01:29:17.159
Labour trouble.
I hear all work may come to a stop.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.079
Will the blame go to him?

01:29:19.359 --> 01:29:22.239
Of course, it will!
He was crowing about the exports.

01:29:22.479 --> 01:29:25.680
All goods are ready, they
were to be shipped out in four days.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.159
He'll have to answer now.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.520
Hope your work is not affected.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.520
Are you crazy or what!

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.760
My family didn't have an
inkling about the factory news.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.800
Brother Shyamal.
- Yes.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.119
What about the problem at your office?
Is it settled?

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.560
Does a crisis go away so easily?

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.840
What crisis?

01:29:45.479 --> 01:29:48.359
That export matter at work.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.920
Were you able to sleep that night?

01:29:54.199 --> 01:29:57.000
You look quite relaxed
since the last few days.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.600
The credit goes to my sister-in-law.

01:30:01.319 --> 01:30:04.600
Did he tell you?
He doesn't tell me anything nowadays.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.119
I wouldn't have told her either.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.680
But she was so upset
I had to tell her.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.119
I don't know how much she understood.

01:30:16.439 --> 01:30:19.479
I hope you don't think I'm a fool!

01:30:20.399 --> 01:30:23.520
What are you saying? Such
problems are common at his office.

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.760
There have been no
bad marks against his name.

01:30:26.039 --> 01:30:26.800
Touchwood!

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.800
On the 12th March,
the factory came to a standstill.

01:30:44.119 --> 01:30:46.720
The labour leaders held
a meeting outside one of the..

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:48.800
..gates and expressed their anguish.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:52.199
Hindustan Peters can't rule!
- Hear, hear!

01:30:52.399 --> 01:30:54.840
After discussing with Ferris,
it was decided that the..

01:30:55.079 --> 01:30:57.319
..charge-sheets would
be given the next day.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:02.039
On 13th March,
Saturday, at 10:30 in the morning..

01:31:02.119 --> 01:31:04.359
..a bomb went off in our factory.

01:31:05.279 --> 01:31:07.680
As a result of which,
one person was injured.

01:31:08.279 --> 01:31:10.920
He was our watchman, Tiwari.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:16.680
I had to visit him at the hospital
in the evening when I heard the news.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.920
On 14th March, Sunday,
our factory was locked at midnight.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.119
There was no need to worry.

01:31:40.439 --> 01:31:42.399
We were saved from making huge losses.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:46.479
Our good name would
stay intact in the market.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.520
On Monday morning
Talukdar came to my room.

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:53.239
What happened? You got injured too?

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.119
Or was it while shaving?

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.000
Shaving for you, to the M.D.
a splinter.

01:32:00.439 --> 01:32:02.000
Tiwari?
- Better.

01:32:02.079 --> 01:32:02.840
Better?

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:07.159
He had diabetes! But he is better.

01:32:09.079 --> 01:32:12.239
I couldn't sleep for two nights.
- Why?

01:32:13.239 --> 01:32:15.039
Why? What if he had died?

01:32:16.279 --> 01:32:17.920
How would that affect you?

01:32:18.279 --> 01:32:20.319
Aren't people dying
in Kolkata every day?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.680
If he had died,
I would've bought a huge wreath and..

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.720
..sent it in your
name complete with a..

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.720
..condolence message and all.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.760
I take my hat off to you!

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.800
'Kolkata!'

01:33:05.399 --> 01:33:06.520
What did you say?

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.640
Only Kolkata.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:10.920
Go and tell them in Patna.

01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:14.159
They think we're in danger
each time we step out of our homes.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.800
Do you know what salary
this cabaret dancer gets?

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.319
How much?

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.720
The famous ones get
a couple of grand you know.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.000
I get the point.

01:33:35.439 --> 01:33:40.119
It's a good job.
But your boyfriend won't approve.

01:33:40.479 --> 01:33:41.520
Maybe not.

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:45.760
Send us a picture of your
boyfriend when you return to Patna.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.600
By the way,
we do allow honeymooning couples..

01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.239
..in our guest room.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.720
This point is taken too.

01:34:04.359 --> 01:34:05.800
Your rival jockey.

01:34:11.239 --> 01:34:12.520
How are you?

01:34:14.479 --> 01:34:16.479
Good evening! How are you?

01:34:17.039 --> 01:34:18.279
Good evening, Mrs. Chatterji.

01:34:18.359 --> 01:34:19.800
Enjoying a lovely evening?

01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:22.239
What's up?

01:34:23.439 --> 01:34:25.000
Is the lockout indefinite?

01:34:25.319 --> 01:34:26.880
No, it'll be settled soon.

01:34:27.159 --> 01:34:28.760
What is the union's mood like?

01:34:29.439 --> 01:34:31.640
I believe they are slapping two
cases to bring the workers in line.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:32.800
That is natural.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.720
Is there a problem at your factory?

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.920
You didn't tell me anything.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.760
I can fully sympathise
with you in this matter.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.439
You, I mean wives,
get emotional so easily.

01:34:46.239 --> 01:34:49.640
I don't know about you,
but if I were to judge..

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.800
..from my wife's reactions then..

01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:54.680
Really when he told me, I felt so bad.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:58.640
I called you up immediately.
But you weren't at home.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.520
Don't worry, Anupa.
Things will straighten out. Let's go.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.520
You're really something.
You don't tell us anything!

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.199
What is there to say?

01:35:09.439 --> 01:35:11.079
Which factory is without
problems nowadays?

01:35:11.159 --> 01:35:13.159
I'm not talking about other factories.

01:35:13.239 --> 01:35:16.399
If something goes wrong in your
factory won't you tell us at home?

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.960
You're all the same.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.279
19th March. The day after
all matters were settled and..

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.600
..all papers had been
signed an incident occurred.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.680
Even though I wasn't present there,
I can't deny that in..

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.199
..some way I was responsible for it.

01:36:30.479 --> 01:36:34.359
A board meeting was called
and after all discussion..

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.279
..Mr. Ferris proposed that Mr.
Shyamalendu Chatterji..

01:36:39.359 --> 01:36:42.640
..should be appointed as an
additional director of the company.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.239
All those in favour?

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.479
Subject to the government's
concurrence etc. etc.

01:36:49.279 --> 01:36:51.279
Congratulations! Come.

01:36:52.399 --> 01:36:54.720
Mr. Chatterji, congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.039
Well done, Chatterji, well done!

01:36:56.119 --> 01:36:59.560
Keep it up, my boy, keep it up!
- Mr. Chatterji, congratulations!

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.359
Thank you, very much! Thank you!

01:37:01.439 --> 01:37:02.880
Thank you so much, Mr. Gordon.

01:37:03.039 --> 01:37:05.279
Heartiest congratulations, Mr. Chatterji.
- Thank you!

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.319
Very well done, Mr. Chatterji.

01:37:07.399 --> 01:37:09.159
Your thoughts are truly brought!

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.840
Congratulations, Brother!
- Thanks.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.239
Something is wrong here, you know.

01:37:22.079 --> 01:37:23.199
Yes please.

01:37:23.399 --> 01:37:26.039
Please connect me to my residence.
- Certainly!

01:37:26.119 --> 01:37:29.159
Only congratulating you won't suffice.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.239
I've to thank you too.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.039
Did the M.D. call you?

01:37:36.319 --> 01:37:37.800
This has really helped you know.

01:37:42.359 --> 01:37:45.880
Amazing! Bye!
- Bye!

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:54.720
Hello! Dolly?
Listen. I'm a director now.

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.560
Really? I can't believe it!

01:38:00.279 --> 01:38:01.479
Where is Tutul?

01:38:02.199 --> 01:38:04.000
Tutul! Tutul!

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.479
Tutul, have you heard the news?

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.840
What? Thank you!

01:38:19.279 --> 01:38:22.239
Your sister was shouting,
my ear is still ringing.

01:38:23.319 --> 01:38:27.600
Tell your sister we'll
celebrate outside tonight.

01:38:29.199 --> 01:38:31.079
Tell her to decide
where she wants to go.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:36.399
Listen, I'll get out
in about five minutes.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.439
Okay? I'll hang up.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.239
Tutul, aren't you thrilled? Tell me!

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:54.359
I'm very happy, sister. Very happy.

01:38:55.399 --> 01:38:58.680
Kick the ball!
- Pass it here!

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.840
Greetings, sir.

01:41:08.159 --> 01:41:09.840
Why are you sweating so much?

01:41:10.079 --> 01:41:13.399
Don't ask. The lift isn't working.

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.159
I had to take the stairs.

01:41:16.359 --> 01:41:17.600
Come and sit under the fan.

01:41:18.479 --> 01:41:20.720
You don't know what
your sister-in-law is doing.

01:41:21.279 --> 01:41:24.359
She was so happy she hugged me tight.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.600
Really? Where is she?

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:27.800
In that room.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:35.680
We'll eat at home today. I'm cooking.
- Okay.

01:41:40.159 --> 01:41:42.920
Anil!
- Yes sir.

01:41:44.119 --> 01:41:45.640
A fresh lime with soda.

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.520
Tutul!

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.319
Sudarshana!

01:42:03.239 --> 01:42:05.199
It must've been quite
a party at the office today.

01:42:06.319 --> 01:42:07.319
Yes, sure.

01:42:09.279 --> 01:42:10.520
What did Ronu say?

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.079
What can he say?

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.840
Whatever he says,
he must be very jealous from within.
