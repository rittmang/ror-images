Screenplay, Music and Direction
by Satyajit Ray

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:54.391
<i>I have passed through fire.</i>

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:59.527
<i>What was impure in me</i>

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:04.094
<i>has been burned to ashes.</i>

00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:10.041
<i>What remains, I dedicate to him,</i>

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.871
<i>to the man who accepted aII my faiIings</i>
<i>in the depths of his stricken heart.</i>

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:21.686
<i>Now I know there is no one eIse Iike him.</i>

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:29.290
<i>It was 1 0 years ago when I first met him.</i>

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:36.061
<i>He was the son of a nobIe famiIy,</i>
<i>and I was his bride.</i>

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.208
<i>I heard that my husband</i>
<i>was of a gentIe disposition.</i>

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:50.109
<i>I considered myseIf fortunate.</i>
<i>Not every bride is so Iucky.</i>

00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:55.276
<i>When I joined the famiIy, my sister-in-Iaw</i>
<i>was aIready a widow, wearing white.</i>

00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:58.415
<i>Though it was never mentioned,</i>

00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:03.257
<i>I couId see that she had never enjoyed</i>
<i>the pIeasures of a happy maritaI Iife.</i>

00:04:19.078 --> 00:04:22.878
<i>Our rooms were in the inner</i>
<i>apartments of the paIace.</i>

00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:28.184
<i>A passage with stained-gIass windows</i>
<i>Ied to the outer apartments.</i>

00:04:28.688 --> 00:04:32.283
<i>The door of this passage</i>
<i>aIways remained cIosed to us.</i>

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.159
<i>I didn't mind the confinement,</i>

00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:39.489
<i>because I was raised</i>
<i>to foIIow traditionaI vaIues.</i>

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.057
<i>But my husband had modern views.</i>

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:48.333
<i>He was the first in his famiIy</i>
<i>to receive a Western education.</i>

00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:54.342
<i>He appointed Miss GiIby</i>
<i>to make a</i> memsahib <i>out of me.</i>

00:07:33.873 --> 00:07:36.273
Why did you have to come here?

00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:48.013
<i>Soon even the cIothes I wore</i>
<i>began to refIect Miss GiIby's infIuence.</i>

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:07.127
English clothes, English songs.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.832
Soon we won't even seem related.

00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:11.341
-- You still haven't told me how l look.
-- Very nice.

00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:14.769
Pretty as a picture.

00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:19.016
You're a lucky one.

00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:21.951
You should grab
your good fortune with both hands.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.868
Few brides have known
happiness in this family.

00:08:30.707 --> 00:08:34.165
Some barely knew their husbands' faces,
let alone the face of happiness.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.942
l used to wait up for him all night,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.017
hoping he'd come to me.

00:08:43.386 --> 00:08:48.824
For two whole days before he died,
l stayed by his bedside.

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:55.493
He was almost unconscious,
dazed with fever.

00:08:56.032 --> 00:08:58.262
He was burning hot.

00:08:58.668 --> 00:09:02.900
Suddenly, he opened his eyes and said,

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:06.567
''Who are you?''

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:14.374
He didn't even recognize his own wife.

00:09:18.054 --> 00:09:22.218
l wonder if you realize
how lucky you are.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:24.593
Why wouldn't l?

00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:27.858
Don't l know my own --

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:32.233
Look who's here.
We were just talking about you.

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:33.859
Really?

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:38.840
l thought only little girls
played with dolls.

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:41.433
Now l see even grown men do.

00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:44.480
-- What do you mean?
-- She's dolling herself up for you.

00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:47.744
Can't you see?
-- l see.

00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.411
She's going to make
your dreams come true.

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:55.124
Well, men must have
their little fantasies.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.650
lsn't that true, sister--in--law?

00:09:59.396 --> 00:10:01.125
Enjoy them.

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:07.367
l'll look on from the wings.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.132
From the wings? Why?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.003
What's the harm in staying here?

00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:14.903
lt's better that way.

00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:18.671
ln my day, we used attar.

00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:25.349
These foreign perfumes
make me feel sick.

00:10:26.923 --> 00:10:28.515
l'll be going now.

00:10:45.742 --> 00:10:47.437
Are these clothes all new?

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:49.341
The tailor brought them today.

00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:51.471
They're all my own design.

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:54.741
l can see that.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:58.581
You dress up so beautifully for me.

00:10:59.823 --> 00:11:02.656
ls it right that l should be
the only man to admire you?

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.922
You think l would dress up
for any other man?

00:11:06.963 --> 00:11:08.828
Why any other man?

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:12.726
l'm just thinking of the ones
l've sung your praises to.

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:15.361
You think they're dying
to catch a glimpse of me?

00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:20.574
-- You know something?
-- What?

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.576
ln the past, confining women
to the house wasn't a Hindu custom.

00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:30.244
Sita, Sabitri, Draupadi...

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.785
None of them were confined.

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:36.017
So what?
Your Bimala is happy here.

00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:43.463
Did you know that women used
to choose their own husbands?

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.930
Have you heard of that?

00:11:49.172 --> 00:11:50.161
Why are you laughing?

00:11:50.607 --> 00:11:54.873
lf l'd had a choice,
l might not have chosen you.

00:11:54.978 --> 00:11:56.206
l know.

00:11:56.746 --> 00:11:58.873
But you didn't have a choice.

00:11:58.982 --> 00:12:00.574
How sad.

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:03.619
l'm envious...

00:12:04.187 --> 00:12:06.018
of Draupadi...

00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:08.022
and her five husbands.

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:15.023
All your life, you've only
set eyes on one man.

00:12:15.632 --> 00:12:19.033
How can you know
what kind of man he is

00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:21.501
if you can't compare him with others?

00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:25.506
You aren't trying to bring back
the classical age, are you?

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:26.666
What for?

00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.975
Still, l see no logic in confining women.

00:12:32.215 --> 00:12:35.241
l think the Muslims introduced the custom.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.348
Hindus never cared about it.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.218
Do you think people will reject
this custom just because you say so?

00:12:44.828 --> 00:12:47.592
lt's not the people
l'm thinking of, Bimala.

00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:51.790
You know l'm not like other people.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:57.199
l don't think tradition
should be followed blindly.

00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:14.952
l would be really proud

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.656
if l could persuade you
to meet my friends.

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:22.088
You mean him?

00:13:27.504 --> 00:13:30.132
Sandip is a genius.

00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:35.433
l have no intention of meeting someone
who's constantly asking you for money

00:13:35.545 --> 00:13:38.105
on one pretext or another.

00:13:39.716 --> 00:13:41.980
Sandip is working
for the good of our nation.

00:13:42.652 --> 00:13:44.950
He's gifted, but has no money.

00:13:46.423 --> 00:13:50.018
lf my money contributes to his good deeds,
that's to my advantage.

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:53.061
For the good of our nation?
What does he do?

00:13:53.163 --> 00:13:54.357
The Swadeshi movement.

00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:57.865
Do you know about it?
-- Of course.

00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:00.902
They often talk about it these days.

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:04.635
Boycott foreign goods.

00:14:04.741 --> 00:14:06.868
Buy only lndian goods.

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:09.843
Don't buy foreign salt or sugar.
Buy our own.

00:14:11.347 --> 00:14:13.315
You know so much.

00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:16.378
l read the newspaper.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.020
-- Do you know why?
-- l do.

00:14:21.124 --> 00:14:22.284
Tell me.

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:25.487
Come. Sit down here and tell me.

00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:35.132
Yes, master.

00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:38.037
Tell me what's behind
the Swadeshi movement.

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:41.903
The governor--general
has split Bengal in two.

00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:44.809
Hindus and Muslims
used to live together in peace,

00:14:44.914 --> 00:14:47.883
but he's driven a wedge between them.

00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:56.119
You seem to forget
that your wife is educated.

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:59.326
l speak English.
Why wouldn't l know all this?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.163
Sandip is a leader
of the Swadeshi movement.

00:15:13.276 --> 00:15:16.768
lsn't their mantra, ''Hail Motherland''?

00:15:17.747 --> 00:15:18.873
Yes.

00:15:25.488 --> 00:15:29.447
This mantra has set
the whole nation on fire.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.286
Except for one person.

00:15:32.395 --> 00:15:34.955
lt hasn't set him on fire.

00:15:41.437 --> 00:15:44.463
lt takes a lot to set me on fire, Bimala.

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:47.533
Although...

00:15:49.178 --> 00:15:52.238
l certainly don't approve
of Lord Curzon's decision.

00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:56.612
Turning Hindus and Muslims
against each other...

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:59.654
l think it's criminal.

00:15:59.756 --> 00:16:02.281
Don't the Swadeshi burn foreign clothes?

00:16:02.392 --> 00:16:05.020
Yes, they do.

00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:07.621
lf they got hold of your sari,
they'd burn it.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.823
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:12.731
Do you know where
this thread comes from?

00:16:12.835 --> 00:16:14.097
Where?

00:16:15.438 --> 00:16:17.872
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:16:17.974 --> 00:16:21.102
Most of the articles
on your dressing table are imported.

00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:24.140
This brush is an import,

00:16:24.247 --> 00:16:27.546
the mirror, the comb.

00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:31.017
Your hairpins are imported.

00:16:31.955 --> 00:16:35.186
These perfumes are French.

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:39.959
Even these bottles
are imported cut glass.

00:16:40.997 --> 00:16:42.794
The table's foreign too.

00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:50.100
Most of the furniture in here
comes from Lazarus.

00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:53.141
lt's a foreign company.

00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:58.046
Really?

00:16:58.414 --> 00:17:00.473
We never even gave it a thought.

00:17:01.317 --> 00:17:03.376
What do you think we should do?

00:17:04.954 --> 00:17:07.081
Why not ask Sandip?

00:17:07.657 --> 00:17:08.851
He's coming here.

00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:11.253
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.556
-- When?
-- Shortly.

00:17:14.263 --> 00:17:15.890
He'll be my guest.

00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:17.990
He's holding a meeting
in our courtyard.

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:26.636
l think you'll enjoy meeting him.

00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:29.945
Why?

00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:35.144
Something about him appeals to women.

00:17:38.955 --> 00:17:41.583
He's had quite a few affairs.

00:17:42.425 --> 00:17:45.519
And not all the women
believed in Swadeshi.

00:17:46.062 --> 00:17:47.825
But he's not married, is he?

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:52.600
He says he has no time for it.

00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:57.204
Married life doesn't suit him.

00:17:58.074 --> 00:18:00.440
He has a restless nature,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.336
unlike me.

00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:05.711
Why would l enjoy
meeting your opposite?

00:18:07.884 --> 00:18:10.045
You may not enjoy it...

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.578
but you may find it instructive.

00:18:14.057 --> 00:18:15.684
l'm happy in my confinement.

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:18.693
l have no wish to be like Sita or Sabitri.

00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:24.459
<i>I was unprepared for what</i>
<i>foIIowed in the next few days.</i>

00:19:08.077 --> 00:19:11.740
<i>I was shocked by Miss GiIby's story.</i>

00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:15.916
<i>It was a Sunday,</i>
<i>so she had gone to church.</i>

00:19:16.018 --> 00:19:17.315
<i>On her way back,</i>

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.687
<i>a IocaI schooIboy hit her</i>
<i>on the head with a stone.</i>

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:25.283
<i>It seemed to be</i>
<i>the infIuence of the Swadeshi.</i>

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:29.330
<i>The peopIe began to feeI</i>
<i>so much hatred towards the British</i>

00:19:29.432 --> 00:19:34.460
<i>that Iife became dangerous even</i>
<i>for innocent peopIe Iike Miss GiIby.</i>

00:19:34.837 --> 00:19:39.035
<i>I was toId I couId no Ionger</i>
<i>become a</i> memsahib.

00:19:44.313 --> 00:19:46.372
<i>Miss GiIby Ieft.</i>

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.620
<i>A few days Iater,</i>
<i>the Swadeshi arrived.</i>

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:55.190
Hail Motherland!

00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.282
Hail Motherland!

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.584
Over there.

00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:02.163
Do you see him?
-- Where?

00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:03.857
Those boys are carrying him
on their shoulders.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.832
Hail Motherland!

00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:34.994
Friends...

00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:41.929
you all know why
we're assembled here tonight.

00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:45.133
For the past few days,

00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:49.901
Bengal has been facing
a serious crisis.

00:20:50.313 --> 00:20:55.512
Lord Curzon, the governor of lndia,
with one strike of his diplomatic sword,

00:20:55.818 --> 00:20:58.946
has severed our golden Bengal in two.

00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:01.819
ln East and West Bengal,

00:21:01.924 --> 00:21:04.188
our two religious groups

00:21:04.293 --> 00:21:12.598
have been united by a spirit
of solidarity, friendship and fraternity,

00:21:12.702 --> 00:21:20.131
and this solidarity has become a source
of grave concern for our rulers.

00:21:20.543 --> 00:21:24.843
The partition has cut
at the very roots of this solidarity.

00:21:25.214 --> 00:21:30.049
Now we all understand
what the policy of our rulers is:

00:21:30.152 --> 00:21:32.143
''Divide and rule.''

00:21:32.255 --> 00:21:35.884
They wish to create a rift between
our two religious communities

00:21:35.992 --> 00:21:39.655
and thereby strengthen
their own position.

00:21:39.762 --> 00:21:42.060
The power of our English rulers

00:21:42.164 --> 00:21:44.155
is matched only by their arrogance.

00:21:44.267 --> 00:21:50.968
The political leaders of Bengal
have risen as one against the partition,

00:21:51.073 --> 00:21:53.633
but our rulers have paid no heed to them.

00:21:54.143 --> 00:21:57.510
We lacked the means to prevent
our rulers from fulfilling their plans,

00:21:57.613 --> 00:22:03.279
but they failed to realize that
we can fight politics with politics.

00:22:03.386 --> 00:22:08.688
The strategy we have adopted
will not only confound our rulers,

00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:11.089
but it will also ultimately
benefit our nation

00:22:11.193 --> 00:22:15.220
and bring prosperity
and independence to our people.

00:22:15.331 --> 00:22:18.027
This is how Swadeshi works.

00:22:18.801 --> 00:22:21.429
l call upon all of you,

00:22:21.537 --> 00:22:23.528
men and women,

00:22:23.639 --> 00:22:25.470
rich and poor,

00:22:25.574 --> 00:22:27.667
rulers and subjects,

00:22:27.777 --> 00:22:32.441
to take a solemn vow

00:22:32.548 --> 00:22:36.609
to reject and boycott all foreign goods
from this moment on

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:40.621
and accept only lndian goods.

00:22:41.424 --> 00:22:46.555
Until now our rulers
have blocked all our attempts

00:22:46.662 --> 00:22:48.653
to develop our own resources.

00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:50.629
We have been forced
to buy their foreign cloth,

00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:54.965
their foreign salt
and their foreign sugar.

00:22:55.071 --> 00:22:57.437
Have you ever considered

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.839
how many everyday items
are being made here?

00:23:01.544 --> 00:23:05.742
l don't know if you've seen
the big foreign stores in Calcutta.

00:23:05.848 --> 00:23:06.974
l have.

00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:12.453
They enjoy staggering prosperity
and a profusion of goods.

00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:14.785
Don't we have the right to ask

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.293
why our wealth should fill
the coffers of our foreign rulers?

00:23:19.395 --> 00:23:21.727
Who gave them the right
to exploit us like this?

00:23:22.164 --> 00:23:24.826
ls this not at the root
of our nation's poverty?

00:23:24.934 --> 00:23:28.335
ls it not our duty to put
an end to this extortion?

00:23:28.437 --> 00:23:32.339
Has not the time come
to abolish this shame?

00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:35.774
lf we remain indifferent to these crimes,
if we do nothing,

00:23:35.878 --> 00:23:39.780
if these foreigners continue
to steal away all our nation's wealth,

00:23:39.882 --> 00:23:42.908
what kind of future
can we expect for our country?

00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:44.987
So l say to you, my brothers,

00:23:45.087 --> 00:23:49.217
the time has come to rise up against
the arrogance of the English government.

00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:51.190
We must not hesitate any longer.

00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:55.195
Let us all take the Swadeshi oath.

00:23:55.297 --> 00:23:59.666
And the great cry from the heart
that will launch us on this task,

00:23:59.769 --> 00:24:04.206
the sacred mantra that
will rock the throne of our rulers,

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:07.537
let us all chant that mantra,

00:24:07.643 --> 00:24:10.134
and, braving all peril,

00:24:10.246 --> 00:24:14.649
dedicate ourselves
to the service of the Motherland.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.117
Hail Motherland!
-- Hail Motherland!

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.010
Still singing English songs after
that impassioned nationalistic speech?

00:24:50.453 --> 00:24:51.681
What should l sing, then?

00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:58.856
Kirtan, Shyama Sangeet,
Nidhu Babu's tappa.

00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:11.432
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:17.001
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

00:25:17.113 --> 00:25:22.710
<i>Radiant as the moon,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:29.382
l must say, he is a good speaker.

00:25:29.492 --> 00:25:31.426
He knows how to turn a phrase.

00:25:31.527 --> 00:25:34.087
He was good at debate in college.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:41.167
<i>Her smiIe sends rippIes of deIight</i>

00:25:41.637 --> 00:25:44.663
All those boys wearing saffron
were a pretty sight.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:54.846
<i>That make the Iove god swoon</i>

00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:01.150
How long is he staying?

00:26:02.191 --> 00:26:04.523
He's going to Rangpur tomorrow.

00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:08.888
He has some business there.

00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:12.633
Do you want to meet him?

00:26:14.036 --> 00:26:17.130
l have nothing to say.
What's the point?

00:26:18.207 --> 00:26:20.641
You don't have to say anything.

00:26:20.743 --> 00:26:22.768
He'll do all the talking.

00:26:54.577 --> 00:26:56.977
What if he asks me about Swadeshi?

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.207
Then answer him.

00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:04.010
He certainly made sense.

00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:07.689
Tell him so.

00:27:08.624 --> 00:27:12.151
l'm sure he'll be shocked
if l wear one of my fancy dresses.

00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:17.726
What do you think l should wear?

00:27:33.048 --> 00:27:35.107
<i>On November 1 5, 1 907,</i>

00:27:35.184 --> 00:27:38.381
<i>the young mistress of the Choudhury house</i>
<i>defied aII convention</i>

00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:41.149
<i>and stepped into the passage</i>
<i>Ieading to the outer apartments.</i>

00:28:44.887 --> 00:28:45.854
Greetings.

00:28:52.027 --> 00:28:56.555
Your speech has inspired my wife
to take up the Swadeshi cause.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.492
-- You must be joking, Nikhil.
-- No, it's true.

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:04.472
Come.

00:29:05.174 --> 00:29:06.698
Have a seat.

00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:10.071
Have a seat, Sandip.

00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:15.145
What's the matter with you?
Have a seat.

00:29:24.093 --> 00:29:29.759
At first, l couldn't believe my eyes.

00:29:31.133 --> 00:29:33.124
Now, l can't believe my ears.

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:36.194
My husband is exaggerating a bit.

00:29:37.172 --> 00:29:41.336
Even if only a fraction of what he said
is true, l'll be more than happy.

00:29:42.344 --> 00:29:44.938
No matter what l may
accomplish as a politician,

00:29:45.047 --> 00:29:48.380
you have already achieved
a social revolution.

00:29:49.418 --> 00:29:51.181
l know how important that is.

00:29:51.553 --> 00:29:52.884
l also realize that,

00:29:52.988 --> 00:29:55.548
although Nikhil's your husband,

00:29:56.058 --> 00:29:58.526
you're not his mere shadow.

00:29:58.627 --> 00:30:00.458
You have a mind of your own.

00:30:01.964 --> 00:30:06.060
Nikhil doesn't take my words
to heart, but you did.

00:30:06.168 --> 00:30:09.262
lf you keep on like that,
she'll be walking on air.

00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:11.999
lt's no use telling me that.

00:30:12.374 --> 00:30:16.834
As a politician, l'm utterly shameless
about seeking support for my cause.

00:30:18.147 --> 00:30:21.480
l have never succeeded
in persuading a woman,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.746
but should that ever happen,
l'd be delighted.

00:30:25.454 --> 00:30:28.821
lt would be an honor
to have a woman in our ranks.

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:35.690
Women have a rare quality

00:30:36.365 --> 00:30:38.333
which we call intuition.

00:30:39.334 --> 00:30:41.700
l admire it greatly.

00:30:42.271 --> 00:30:45.798
Man's ability to reason
pales beside it.

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:48.804
What do you say, Nikhil?

00:30:50.946 --> 00:30:54.575
Why don't you tell him
what you thought of his speech?

00:30:54.683 --> 00:30:56.048
Oh, yes.

00:30:57.085 --> 00:30:59.576
That's what l was going to ask you.

00:31:00.622 --> 00:31:02.089
Tell me...

00:31:04.293 --> 00:31:07.660
did it sound like total drivel to you?

00:31:08.497 --> 00:31:10.522
Come on. Don't hesitate.

00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:13.267
l haven't had much time to think about it.

00:31:13.368 --> 00:31:15.836
That's precisely why l'm asking you.

00:31:15.938 --> 00:31:18.998
Why do you have to think?
Thinking is his task.

00:31:19.107 --> 00:31:22.702
Just tell me what comes from your heart.
Forget about rationality.

00:31:24.546 --> 00:31:27.481
l didn't understand much, but...

00:31:28.617 --> 00:31:33.554
l feel that if the English
have done wrong by splitting up Bengal,

00:31:33.655 --> 00:31:36.180
we should not let it pass.

00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:41.455
lf Swadeshi can shake them up
a bit, then we should do it.

00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:49.069
Of course, if only a few people take up
the cause, it won't have any impact.

00:31:49.338 --> 00:31:54.207
But if the whole country joins in,
then we may succeed.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.573
Exactly!

00:31:57.246 --> 00:31:59.043
Exactly.

00:31:59.448 --> 00:32:01.575
That's exactly what we're trying to do.

00:32:01.683 --> 00:32:05.517
We want to awaken the nation
with our mantra, ''Hail Motherland!''

00:32:05.954 --> 00:32:09.720
Don't you think there's magic
in those two words?

00:32:09.825 --> 00:32:11.884
Have you ever said them?

00:32:15.097 --> 00:32:16.724
You should.

00:32:17.299 --> 00:32:19.859
You don't need to shout it.
Just whisper it.

00:32:19.968 --> 00:32:25.235
As a matter of fact,
when you all shouted that mantra,

00:32:25.607 --> 00:32:26.801
l felt a --

00:32:27.543 --> 00:32:29.101
A thrill?

00:32:30.846 --> 00:32:32.473
A shiver down my spine.

00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:34.310
That's how it should be.

00:32:35.117 --> 00:32:39.349
Did you know that your husband
doesn't believe in our mantra?

00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:43.955
lsn't that right, Nikhil?
-- l don't believe in propaganda.

00:32:44.593 --> 00:32:47.562
Propaganda?
What do you mean by that?

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:53.927
lf you're recruiting people who have never
cared about their country's problems before,

00:32:54.036 --> 00:32:55.594
how can you do it
without using propaganda?

00:32:56.104 --> 00:32:58.902
But the cause must come first, Nikhil.

00:32:59.007 --> 00:33:00.770
That's all that matters.

00:33:00.876 --> 00:33:03.242
Commitment to the cause
will come through inspiration,

00:33:03.345 --> 00:33:05.905
and the inspiration
will come from our mantra.

00:33:06.014 --> 00:33:08.949
Don't you remember the significance of
<i>''La MarseiIIaise"</i> in the French Revolution?

00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:15.923
What we need most today
is to rouse the people to action.

00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:19.024
Our poets are writing Swadeshi songs.

00:33:19.127 --> 00:33:21.186
Their sole purpose is to inspire the people.

00:33:21.296 --> 00:33:23.127
Have you ever heard any?

00:33:23.832 --> 00:33:28.769
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.304
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:33:31.406 --> 00:33:36.241
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:33:36.345 --> 00:33:38.006
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:33:38.113 --> 00:33:41.412
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:44.007
<i>You take so much pride</i>

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:46.587
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

00:33:46.688 --> 00:33:51.557
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.287
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:33:53.395 --> 00:33:56.831
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

00:33:56.932 --> 00:33:59.298
<i>You take so much pride</i>

00:33:59.401 --> 00:34:01.835
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

00:34:01.937 --> 00:34:04.667
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>

00:34:04.773 --> 00:34:07.207
<i>To keep us back forever?</i>

00:34:07.309 --> 00:34:09.675
<i>To hoId us down forever?</i>

00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:12.076
<i>To keep us back forever?</i>

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.671
<i>To hoId us down forever?</i>

00:34:14.783 --> 00:34:17.047
<i>You don't have that much strength</i>

00:34:17.152 --> 00:34:19.177
<i>You don't have that much strength</i>

00:34:19.287 --> 00:34:21.778
<i>Your strength wiII not withstand us</i>

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:26.623
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:34:26.728 --> 00:34:28.923
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:34:29.698 --> 00:34:32.098
<i>You may try to govern us</i>

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.225
<i>But even the weak can summon strength</i>

00:34:34.703 --> 00:34:37.137
<i>You may try to govern us</i>

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.571
<i>But even the weak can summon strength</i>

00:34:39.675 --> 00:34:42.041
<i>You may pride</i>
<i>yourseIf on your might</i>

00:34:42.144 --> 00:34:44.112
<i>You may pride</i>
<i>yourseIf on your might</i>

00:34:44.212 --> 00:34:47.045
<i>But God is stiII mightier</i>

00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:51.984
<i>Rob us of our strength</i>
<i>and you dig your own grave</i>

00:34:52.087 --> 00:34:57.047
<i>Rob us of our strength</i>
<i>and you dig your own grave</i>

00:34:57.159 --> 00:34:59.559
<i>Your boat wiII sureIy sink</i>

00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:01.788
<i>Your boat wiII sureIy sink</i>

00:35:01.897 --> 00:35:04.263
<i>Under the weight of your own guiIt</i>

00:35:04.366 --> 00:35:09.360
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:10.961
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:35:11.073 --> 00:35:14.372
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

00:35:14.476 --> 00:35:16.944
<i>You take so much pride</i>

00:35:17.045 --> 00:35:19.445
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

00:35:19.548 --> 00:35:24.485
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:35:24.586 --> 00:35:27.487
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:31.992
l admit it's a beautiful song.

00:35:32.994 --> 00:35:35.258
Oh, my. What's all this?

00:35:35.363 --> 00:35:38.355
Swadeshi tea. Darjeeling.

00:35:38.467 --> 00:35:41.493
But there's a lot more here than just tea.

00:35:41.603 --> 00:35:45.596
You should have
some sweets too, not just tea.

00:35:45.707 --> 00:35:49.370
They're not only Swadeshi,
Bimala made them herself.

00:35:49.478 --> 00:35:51.241
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:35:51.346 --> 00:35:53.610
Then l have to try one.

00:35:54.483 --> 00:35:57.884
l haven't gotten over
my weakness for sweets yet.

00:35:57.986 --> 00:36:00.511
Nor your weakness
for foreign cigarettes, l see.

00:36:00.622 --> 00:36:01.953
Out of the question.

00:36:02.057 --> 00:36:05.652
Are you familiar
with the Swadeshi brands?

00:36:06.194 --> 00:36:07.559
Unthinkable!

00:36:07.662 --> 00:36:10.324
-- Can't you give it up?
-- Smoking?

00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:13.827
Don't you have the willpower?

00:36:19.341 --> 00:36:22.777
Okay. Join our party,
and l'll stop smoking.

00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:25.371
Any sugar?

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.005
One teaspoon if it's foreign,
two if it's lndian.

00:36:36.792 --> 00:36:38.487
So tell me...

00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:41.386
what are your plans?

00:36:42.164 --> 00:36:43.631
They're not settled yet.

00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:48.602
Your neighbor, the land owner
Harish Kundu, has sent for me.

00:36:50.338 --> 00:36:53.705
They're having a bonfire
of foreign clothes at his place.

00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:58.375
He wants me to help run the event,
so l must go there at once.

00:37:01.416 --> 00:37:02.610
Madam Bimala,

00:37:02.717 --> 00:37:07.051
did you know that the only stumbling
block left is your husband?

00:37:07.155 --> 00:37:09.487
He refuses to help the cause.

00:37:10.692 --> 00:37:14.492
You'll find many landed gentry
around here who support Swadeshi.

00:37:15.897 --> 00:37:18.889
What's the harm
in leaving my estate out of it?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.764
You see?
Did you see that?

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.270
Not even a shred of patriotism in him.

00:37:28.743 --> 00:37:30.711
Ah, well.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.774
So...

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.750
will you join our cause?

00:37:37.652 --> 00:37:38.914
Don't worry.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.386
You don't have to sign
a pledge or anything.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.884
You'll stay exactly as you are.

00:37:44.993 --> 00:37:47.086
l'll come to you if need be.

00:37:50.432 --> 00:37:51.922
Well?

00:37:52.033 --> 00:37:53.728
Yes or no?

00:37:54.603 --> 00:37:55.592
All right.

00:37:57.105 --> 00:37:58.902
l should be going now.

00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:02.405
-- Do you have to?
-- Yes, l have work to do.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.377
My boys are waiting downstairs.

00:38:06.281 --> 00:38:11.617
Madam Bimala, this is truly
a memorable day for me.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.985
l only have one request.

00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:16.319
Always trust your intuition.

00:38:16.424 --> 00:38:18.984
Don't let this gentleman influence you.

00:38:19.461 --> 00:38:22.191
Rest assured, Sandip.

00:38:22.931 --> 00:38:26.662
From now on,
my wife is a free agent.

00:38:26.768 --> 00:38:28.326
Wonderful!

00:38:28.737 --> 00:38:31.228
Good. l'll be going then.

00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:33.973
l'll see you out.

00:39:20.588 --> 00:39:22.453
<i>HaiI MotherIand!</i>

00:39:36.805 --> 00:39:38.966
Hail Motherland.

00:39:45.847 --> 00:39:49.749
-- You haven't told me yet.
-- What?

00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:53.249
What you thought of my friend.

00:39:53.355 --> 00:39:56.552
But l only met him once.

00:39:57.559 --> 00:40:03.725
l think the less one knows Sandip,
the better one likes him.

00:40:03.832 --> 00:40:06.767
You seem to have so little in common.

00:40:07.202 --> 00:40:10.501
l wonder how you managed
to become friends.

00:40:13.108 --> 00:40:15.440
That's not unusual, Bimala.

00:40:17.012 --> 00:40:21.210
Friendships aren't
worked out mathematically.

00:40:23.084 --> 00:40:26.542
We've been friends since college.

00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:30.356
lt's not like we have nothing in common.

00:40:31.826 --> 00:40:39.062
We both decided to reject
the irrational conventions of our society.

00:40:39.734 --> 00:40:44.330
He's always been more radical than l.

00:40:46.674 --> 00:40:49.768
When his parents arranged a bride for him,

00:40:49.878 --> 00:40:52.904
he was so annoyed
he severed all ties with them.

00:40:59.988 --> 00:41:04.755
Shortly after we got married,
he asked me to introduce him to you.

00:41:06.961 --> 00:41:10.124
He would remind me from time to time.

00:41:12.367 --> 00:41:14.301
Finally, he said,

00:41:14.636 --> 00:41:18.800
''l don't believe a word
you've said about your wife.''

00:41:24.712 --> 00:41:27.977
And do you know what he said today?
-- What?

00:41:34.389 --> 00:41:37.324
-- l'm not telling you.
-- Why not?

00:41:39.794 --> 00:41:42.627
What can he say about you
after such a brief meeting?

00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:46.525
l could say a lot more.

00:41:47.368 --> 00:41:49.836
But you never do.

00:41:51.306 --> 00:41:53.706
Do l have to?

00:41:54.442 --> 00:41:57.343
Don't you have your intuition?

00:42:38.019 --> 00:42:40.852
-- <i>Madam.</i>
-- What is it?

00:42:40.955 --> 00:42:43.389
<i>A Ietter from Mr. Mukherjee.</i>

00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:57.434
l hope the rule wasn't intended
to be broken for one day alone.

00:42:57.539 --> 00:43:00.838
Can l see you for a moment?

00:43:01.776 --> 00:43:04.768
-- Tell him l'm coming.
-- As you wish.

00:43:08.917 --> 00:43:13.547
''When Krishna's flute beckons so,
how can l not go?''

00:44:04.806 --> 00:44:06.501
Hail Motherland.

00:44:08.409 --> 00:44:09.740
My husband's not here.

00:44:10.545 --> 00:44:13.639
l didn't ask for him.
l asked for you.

00:44:14.649 --> 00:44:16.446
Won't you sit down?

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:24.217
You've eluded me for years.

00:44:24.325 --> 00:44:27.453
You mustn't keep your distance now.

00:44:28.296 --> 00:44:31.459
Come and sit here,
right beside me.

00:44:57.025 --> 00:44:58.686
What's the matter?

00:45:01.062 --> 00:45:03.155
l can't believe it.

00:45:04.132 --> 00:45:09.331
Ever since you married, Nikhil promised
he would introduce me to you.

00:45:09.437 --> 00:45:11.905
l never believed him.

00:45:12.006 --> 00:45:14.941
Even now, l find it hard to believe.

00:45:16.144 --> 00:45:19.307
Until now, l've only heard about
your many accomplishments.

00:45:19.414 --> 00:45:21.507
You learned English from a <i>memsahib.</i>

00:45:21.616 --> 00:45:26.576
You love reading books, knitting, cooking.

00:45:26.688 --> 00:45:31.318
l even know what you like to cook,
to eat, your favorite flowers.

00:45:31.426 --> 00:45:33.519
l know everything.

00:45:35.096 --> 00:45:37.724
l also know something else.

00:45:38.833 --> 00:45:43.668
You resent the fact
that Nikhil lends me money.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.774
So you really aren't a stranger to me.

00:45:48.276 --> 00:45:51.507
But l never imagined...

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.140
l'd one day find myself
sitting by your side.

00:45:58.086 --> 00:46:01.487
-- Did you go to Rangpur?
-- Yes, l did.

00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:04.422
-- How was the trip?
-- Great.

00:46:04.859 --> 00:46:08.260
That's why the first thing l wanted
to see this morning was you.

00:46:09.664 --> 00:46:11.825
Don't you have to leave again?

00:46:11.933 --> 00:46:14.299
-- Where to?
-- To Rangpur.

00:46:14.402 --> 00:46:17.200
lsn't that your base?

00:46:17.905 --> 00:46:21.898
That was the idea, but not anymore.

00:46:22.443 --> 00:46:24.035
lt's not?

00:46:26.547 --> 00:46:28.481
Let me be frank with you.

00:46:29.016 --> 00:46:31.211
l want to be near you when l work.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.089
Just like a bee working for the queen.

00:46:39.193 --> 00:46:40.751
You'll be the queen bee.

00:46:43.898 --> 00:46:45.763
Do you have any objection?

00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:50.969
But won't you find it inconvenient
working from here?

00:46:57.078 --> 00:46:58.705
That's true.

00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:07.249
l don't think Nikhil will approve of this.

00:47:11.325 --> 00:47:13.020
But the thing is...

00:47:16.164 --> 00:47:18.394
l am essentially...

00:47:21.803 --> 00:47:23.634
a stubborn man.

00:47:25.473 --> 00:47:28.909
l just can't accept Nikhil's attitude.

00:47:31.679 --> 00:47:37.811
l want to promote
the Swadeshi cause right here...

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.045
and l need your help.

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.691
But l really know nothing about your work.

00:47:45.793 --> 00:47:49.524
l know that you
give speeches. ls that all?

00:47:51.933 --> 00:47:54.731
That's one of the most important things.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.036
Persuasion can work wonders.

00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:01.331
Wait.

00:48:02.643 --> 00:48:05.168
lf you really want to know about our work,

00:48:05.913 --> 00:48:07.380
then read this.

00:48:07.482 --> 00:48:08.744
OUR STRUGGLE

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:11.444
lt contains everything you need to know.

00:48:16.257 --> 00:48:18.088
l will definitely read it.

00:48:20.027 --> 00:48:22.461
May l tell you something now?

00:48:23.664 --> 00:48:26.792
One of the biggest markets
in this area is here, in Sukhsayar.

00:48:26.901 --> 00:48:30.064
Did you know that?
-- So l've heard.

00:48:30.638 --> 00:48:36.440
lt's the only market in the area
where foreign goods are still being sold.

00:48:36.711 --> 00:48:40.545
Elsewhere, the landowners
have prohibited their sale,

00:48:40.648 --> 00:48:42.240
but Nikhil hasn't.

00:48:43.351 --> 00:48:45.945
l'm going to do my best to change that,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.053
but, with your help,
my task will be much easier.

00:48:51.158 --> 00:48:54.685
l'm afraid you're overestimating
my capabilities.

00:48:54.795 --> 00:48:56.660
Not at all.

00:48:57.465 --> 00:49:01.765
Nikhil may be my friend,
but he's your husband.

00:49:01.869 --> 00:49:04.838
You have much more influence
over him than l do.

00:49:04.939 --> 00:49:08.705
My husband isn't easily swayed.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.602
l know...

00:49:11.345 --> 00:49:14.178
but l think he'll listen to you.

00:49:18.886 --> 00:49:21.548
l know how much you mean to Nikhil.

00:49:22.924 --> 00:49:25.392
Will you try just once to persuade him?

00:49:27.995 --> 00:49:31.260
Nikhil's tenants wouldn't dare
to go against his will.

00:49:31.365 --> 00:49:34.596
He only has to tell them not to bring
any more foreign goods to the market.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.567
And if l fail to persuade him?

00:49:38.372 --> 00:49:41.068
l'll be happy if you just try.

00:49:42.343 --> 00:49:44.436
lf you fail, l'll find another way.

00:49:45.346 --> 00:49:47.337
Not without the queen bee's
knowledge, of course.

00:49:48.883 --> 00:49:51.477
Can l depend on you?

00:49:52.553 --> 00:49:54.111
l'll try my best.

00:50:01.963 --> 00:50:03.624
The more l see you,

00:50:04.332 --> 00:50:06.357
the more l admire you.

00:50:18.379 --> 00:50:19.778
l think l'll --

00:50:20.314 --> 00:50:22.612
Okay, you may go now.

00:50:26.821 --> 00:50:28.618
Oh, and one more thing.

00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:31.819
This item of yours.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.836
This is the only foreign item
l will keep with me.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:52.044
Did you see Sandip today?

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.577
<i>Yes.</i>

00:50:57.284 --> 00:50:59.081
How is he doing?

00:51:00.554 --> 00:51:02.488
He's worried.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:04.080
Why?

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.058
You won't let him promote
the Swadeshi cause here.

00:51:08.496 --> 00:51:11.897
Nonsense.
You heard me yourself.

00:51:12.266 --> 00:51:16.362
He's free to fight for his cause
as long as he leaves my estate alone.

00:51:17.872 --> 00:51:20.238
He says he's staying here.

00:51:21.542 --> 00:51:23.100
Staying here?

00:51:24.078 --> 00:51:25.568
That's what he says.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.541
He's going to stay and work here.

00:51:30.951 --> 00:51:32.976
That wouldn't be right.

00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:36.189
But all of Bengal has taken up
the Swadeshi cause.

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:37.382
Why don't you?

00:51:38.426 --> 00:51:43.796
That would mean banning
all foreign goods from the market.

00:51:44.732 --> 00:51:47.530
Harish Kundu can do that, but not me.

00:51:48.369 --> 00:51:50.599
Surely the market belongs to you.
Why can't you?

00:51:51.605 --> 00:51:53.596
lt's not my market, Bimala.

00:51:54.108 --> 00:51:57.373
The market belongs to the traders
who sell their goods there.

00:51:57.478 --> 00:51:59.139
They're poor.

00:52:00.748 --> 00:52:05.617
Foreign goods are cheaper
and of better quality than lndian goods.

00:52:07.688 --> 00:52:11.715
The poor villagers can afford them.
How can l force them not to buy them?

00:52:14.695 --> 00:52:18.859
Swadeshi is for those who can afford it,

00:52:18.966 --> 00:52:20.797
not for the poor.

00:52:25.773 --> 00:52:27.502
What are you thinking?

00:52:28.375 --> 00:52:30.275
Can we follow Swadeshi...

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.509
without making the poor suffer?

00:52:34.615 --> 00:52:36.310
ls it possible?

00:52:36.984 --> 00:52:40.420
lf it were possible,
l'd definitely support Swadeshi.

00:52:41.555 --> 00:52:43.989
You believe the very idea
of Swadeshi is wrong.

00:52:45.392 --> 00:52:48.054
Even if l do,
who would listen to me?

00:52:48.162 --> 00:52:50.596
The entire country supports Swadeshi.

00:52:51.398 --> 00:52:53.889
You yourself believe Sandip is right.

00:52:54.001 --> 00:52:56.231
Many others must feel the same way.

00:52:58.139 --> 00:53:04.977
But l believe that coercing the poor
can only harm our country.

00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:13.251
l can see you're not convinced.

00:53:14.355 --> 00:53:16.983
l was looking at it differently.

00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:20.686
l was thinking that
something has to be done.

00:53:20.795 --> 00:53:22.820
Even if it means
hardship for the poor now,

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:25.125
it will help them in the long run.

00:53:25.533 --> 00:53:28.502
The Swadeshi care about this country.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:36.373
l believe what they care about
is an abstract idea of this country,

00:53:36.477 --> 00:53:39.071
this country as the Mother Goddess.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.677
The nation is our mother.

00:53:41.782 --> 00:53:47.015
Worship our mother,
work for our mother, pray to our mother.

00:53:47.788 --> 00:53:50.621
Everything you do is for our mother.

00:53:51.292 --> 00:53:53.726
Heal our mother's pain.

00:53:54.461 --> 00:53:56.122
l can understand that.

00:53:56.964 --> 00:53:59.762
And l can understand why
that idea appeals to women.

00:54:00.401 --> 00:54:03.234
l know how you feel, Bimala,

00:54:03.337 --> 00:54:05.703
but l don't feel the same way.

00:54:29.763 --> 00:54:31.924
Those things you said tonight...

00:54:32.266 --> 00:54:34.427
Were those your own thoughts?

00:54:34.535 --> 00:54:36.696
Why are you asking me this?

00:54:38.873 --> 00:54:41.899
l felt as if you were speaking for Sandip.

00:54:42.009 --> 00:54:44.910
Sandip is your friend, not mine.

00:54:46.513 --> 00:54:51.712
l thought you two had teamed up
''in right earnest'' to fight for a higher cause.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.987
He's working on the public front,
and you on the domestic.

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.648
What an idea!

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.061
Will you have daily meetings?

00:55:08.602 --> 00:55:13.471
You insisted that l meet your friend,
so you can spare me the insinuations.

00:55:26.921 --> 00:55:29.549
l just asked a simple question.

00:55:30.324 --> 00:55:32.884
l wasn't insinuating anything.
-- Very well.

00:55:32.993 --> 00:55:36.019
lf it upsets you so much,
l won't go outside anymore.

00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:38.865
You're mistaken, Bimala.

00:55:38.966 --> 00:55:41.230
l'm not upset at all.

00:55:41.735 --> 00:55:44.898
After all, l know you both so well.

00:55:45.005 --> 00:55:49.465
Why shouldn't you go outside?
-- Because l don't want to.

00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:52.169
You're being unreasonable.

00:55:52.279 --> 00:55:55.840
l've been out twice already.
l don't have to go out every day.

00:55:58.585 --> 00:56:00.314
Very well.

00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:15.598
l won't restrict you
from going where you please.

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:21.671
As l told you,
you are completely free.

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:27.247
But l must tell you one thing.

00:56:29.116 --> 00:56:33.143
lf you tell me you want to give up
wearing foreign clothes,

00:56:33.754 --> 00:56:38.748
or do without your foreign
perfumes, shoes and soap,

00:56:39.059 --> 00:56:41.289
l won't mind at all.

00:56:41.595 --> 00:56:43.995
But clamping down on poor traders

00:56:45.666 --> 00:56:48.794
by banning foreign goods in the market

00:56:49.737 --> 00:56:52.797
means going against
my own beliefs and principles.

00:56:53.374 --> 00:56:55.672
l could never do that, Bimala.

00:57:02.116 --> 00:57:06.052
Swadeshi is something l can't take lightly.

00:57:12.326 --> 00:57:16.820
<i>The weak say, ''Whatever fate</i>
<i>has given to me is mine. "</i>

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:21.264
<i>And the impotent agree with them.</i>

00:57:21.368 --> 00:57:24.132
<i>''OnIy what I can snatch away</i>
<i>by force is mine. "</i>

00:57:24.238 --> 00:57:26.763
<i>That is what experience has taught us.</i>

00:57:26.874 --> 00:57:30.037
<i>My country is not mine</i>
<i>simpIy because I was born here.</i>

00:57:30.144 --> 00:57:34.012
<i>It becomes mine</i>
<i>onIy when I am abIe to win it by force.</i>

00:57:34.114 --> 00:57:36.446
<i>OnIy then can the nation be mine.</i>

00:57:41.889 --> 00:57:48.954
This funeral pyre celebrates the cremation
of foreign trade in your village.

00:57:49.763 --> 00:57:52.027
These ashes are sacred.

00:57:52.399 --> 00:57:54.128
Hail Motherland!

00:58:09.616 --> 00:58:14.918
AN URGENT MATTER
REGARDlNG OUR CAUSE

00:58:26.166 --> 00:58:30.068
-- Please give this to Mrs. Choudhury.
-- Very well.

00:59:11.845 --> 00:59:13.904
Madam isn't feeling well, sir.

00:59:18.919 --> 00:59:20.750
l see.

00:59:31.798 --> 00:59:34.926
-- You know the headmaster, don't you?
-- Yes, of course.

00:59:35.035 --> 00:59:38.266
Good morning.
l hope you are doing well.

00:59:39.473 --> 00:59:42.237
Not as long as you're around.

00:59:45.879 --> 00:59:47.176
How come?

00:59:47.581 --> 00:59:51.017
His students have all disappeared
since you arrived.

00:59:52.553 --> 00:59:58.082
But you must admit that working
for one's country helps build character.

01:00:00.794 --> 01:00:05.197
One of my students was influenced
by the Swadeshi movement.

01:00:05.299 --> 01:00:09.201
He threw a stone at Mrs. Choudhury's
governess, Miss Gilby.

01:00:09.803 --> 01:00:12.567
Would you consider that
an example of character building?

01:00:13.106 --> 01:00:16.371
But that happened before l came.

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:19.208
You can't blame me for that.

01:00:19.313 --> 01:00:22.680
After all, you must admit
that a few such incidents

01:00:22.783 --> 01:00:27.186
are inevitable in times
of great social upheaval.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:30.382
You even roped in my best student.

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:32.583
Who? Amulya?

01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:36.625
He'd have won a scholarship
if he'd taken his exam.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:39.460
You stole that opportunity from him.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.163
Amulya? l didn't rope him in.
He joined of his own accord.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:48.334
What about the other rowdy dissolutes
who have joined your team?

01:00:48.442 --> 01:00:51.536
They're the worst troublemakers in the village.

01:00:51.645 --> 01:00:54.170
They're not troublemakers anymore, sir.

01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:57.182
They're fighting for the cause.
They're working hard.

01:00:57.651 --> 01:01:01.519
With two exceptions,
everyone here is working for the cause.

01:01:01.622 --> 01:01:03.283
One of them is you.

01:01:04.157 --> 01:01:08.093
The other one is your former
student Nikhilesh Choudhury.

01:01:08.195 --> 01:01:11.426
l regret that
l couldn't persuade him to join.

01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:14.295
Like you, he turns a deaf ear
to the Swadeshi cause.

01:01:14.401 --> 01:01:17.336
No, he isn't against Swadeshi ideals.

01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:21.567
He's against your
destructive brand of Swadeshi.

01:01:22.175 --> 01:01:24.439
He practiced Swadeshi long before you,

01:01:24.544 --> 01:01:27.513
and he never relied
on any battle cries or mantras.

01:01:27.614 --> 01:01:30.378
-- l know that.
-- You know nothing!

01:01:30.484 --> 01:01:32.577
Do you know about his Swadeshi bank?

01:01:32.686 --> 01:01:36.144
Or his Swadeshi sugar factory,
his soap factory?

01:01:36.256 --> 01:01:41.489
Do you know he set up his own looms
for weaving Swadeshi cloth?

01:01:41.895 --> 01:01:46.798
Where were you
and your ''Hail Motherland'' then?

01:01:47.334 --> 01:01:50.861
Do you know how much
he spent for Swadeshi?

01:01:50.971 --> 01:01:52.996
-- Please, headmaster --
-- You stay out of this!

01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:57.509
These things must be said.
-- But that's what l keep telling him.

01:01:57.611 --> 01:02:01.240
lf both of us have the same goals,
then why doesn't he join us?

01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:05.250
You don't have the same goals.
There are many differences.

01:02:05.352 --> 01:02:09.721
Your goal is power and leadership.

01:02:09.823 --> 01:02:11.984
You don't care about the people!

01:02:12.092 --> 01:02:14.890
Nikhil never thought about himself.

01:02:14.995 --> 01:02:19.728
People are applauding you
and singing your praises.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.932
Nikhil was ridiculed.

01:02:23.036 --> 01:02:27.666
He had no head for business,
so his brand of Swadeshi didn't last.

01:02:27.774 --> 01:02:30.106
But his way was the right way.

01:02:30.544 --> 01:02:32.136
Yours is wrong.

01:02:32.245 --> 01:02:33.872
lt's more than wrong.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.039
lt's dangerous.

01:02:38.652 --> 01:02:40.347
Give those to me.

01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:44.354
l'll drop by this evening.

01:02:48.562 --> 01:02:50.462
My goodness.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.001
Please, Nikhil, l implore you.

01:02:57.104 --> 01:02:59.902
Keep that headmaster away from me.

01:03:00.006 --> 01:03:03.965
l came here to give speeches,
not listen to them.

01:03:05.645 --> 01:03:07.636
Are you planning to stay here and work?

01:03:14.888 --> 01:03:19.382
l'm going to speak
at your market this afternoon.

01:03:20.894 --> 01:03:23.192
That's where our greatest
challenge lies, Nikhil.

01:03:24.664 --> 01:03:29.727
Not where the landowner
is already in favor of Swadeshi,

01:03:31.405 --> 01:03:33.202
but where he isn't.

01:03:33.306 --> 01:03:35.331
But remember, Sandip,

01:03:35.942 --> 01:03:38.740
most of my tenants are poor Muslims.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:45.408
l don't want them harassed.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.584
lf l see that happening,
l will be forced to intervene.

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:56.053
lf they prove to be obstacles
to our revolution,

01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:58.729
l'll have to take the necessary measures.

01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:01.099
Many Muslims have accepted Swadeshi.

01:04:02.335 --> 01:04:04.200
They were forced to do so.

01:04:05.605 --> 01:04:07.573
lt will happen here too.

01:04:11.044 --> 01:04:12.944
l've said what l had to say.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.046
What you do now is up to you.

01:04:24.257 --> 01:04:26.487
As you all know,

01:04:26.593 --> 01:04:28.925
our English rulers

01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:32.965
have divided Bengal in two.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:40.932
This amounts to erecting a wall
between Hindus and Muslims.

01:04:41.274 --> 01:04:46.769
They have not given us
the right to break this wall,

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.283
but, to foil the government,
we have chosen a different path.

01:04:51.384 --> 01:04:54.012
One important way to fight the partition

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:59.353
is to stop selling foreign goods
in our markets.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:05.760
Salt, sugar, cloth and soap
are all everyday items

01:05:05.866 --> 01:05:09.165
which are only available
as foreign products at your market.

01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.304
By selling their foreign goods here,

01:05:12.405 --> 01:05:17.536
the British are making
a lot of money in our country,

01:05:17.644 --> 01:05:22.479
while we keep growing poorer.

01:05:22.582 --> 01:05:25.176
This is wrong.
This must stop.

01:05:25.285 --> 01:05:28.743
We've tolerated this up to now,
but no more.

01:05:29.356 --> 01:05:35.454
l know that lndian substitutes
for foreign goods are not always available,

01:05:35.562 --> 01:05:40.295
so you've had to trade with foreign goods
because that's all you had.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.767
But if we can all make sacrifices

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:47.772
and produce our own goods,

01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:51.605
then we will overcome these difficulties.

01:05:51.878 --> 01:05:55.211
Brothers, we are depending on you.

01:05:55.815 --> 01:05:57.749
lf you come forward and join us,

01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:00.718
together we will stop
the partitioning of Bengal

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.288
and regain our pride.

01:06:03.823 --> 01:06:08.283
And now, do you see
this circle here before me?

01:06:08.395 --> 01:06:13.662
Throw all your foreign goods
into the circle of flags.

01:06:14.534 --> 01:06:17.594
lndian substitutes will be made.

01:06:18.438 --> 01:06:21.498
Many manufacturers
have come forward to help us.

01:06:21.942 --> 01:06:25.105
Have no fear of losing your livelihood.

01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:29.408
Today's loss will not be lost forever.

01:06:29.516 --> 01:06:34.283
Now l ask you to throw all
of your foreign goods into the circle.

01:06:34.654 --> 01:06:39.648
The land that gave birth to you,
the land that you love...

01:06:39.759 --> 01:06:42.250
Now is the time to help her.

01:06:42.729 --> 01:06:46.426
Foreign cloth, foreign thread,

01:06:46.533 --> 01:06:49.764
foreign sugar, foreign salt,

01:06:50.337 --> 01:06:52.134
foreign scissors and knives,

01:06:52.238 --> 01:06:55.730
foreign matches,
and everything else foreign...

01:06:55.842 --> 01:06:58.367
Throw them in that circle.

01:06:58.478 --> 01:07:02.107
We beseech you.
Don't just sit there.

01:07:02.215 --> 01:07:04.547
Help the Swadeshi cause.

01:07:04.651 --> 01:07:08.610
We want to hear it from the maharaja!
Let him come here.

01:07:09.122 --> 01:07:10.487
We won't listen to you!

01:07:12.392 --> 01:07:14.917
Your maharaja is my friend.

01:07:15.028 --> 01:07:17.428
l'm his guest.

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:20.795
lsn't that proof enough
that l have his support?

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.892
We're traders.
lf we have nothing to sell, we'll starve!

01:07:24.004 --> 01:07:27.098
We've tried selling lndian goods.

01:07:27.207 --> 01:07:28.504
Nobody buys them.

01:07:28.608 --> 01:07:31.406
You're a gentleman.
You have money.

01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:35.242
lt's easy for you to say,
''Don't sell foreign goods.''

01:07:35.348 --> 01:07:38.181
We're poor!
How will we survive?

01:07:44.457 --> 01:07:47.426
<i>It's cIear that persuasion</i>
<i>won't work on NikhiI's estate.</i>

01:07:47.527 --> 01:07:50.121
<i>We'II have to use other means.</i>

01:07:50.597 --> 01:07:55.261
<i>Any compromise on foreign goods</i>
<i>wouId crippIe our movement.</i>

01:07:57.337 --> 01:08:00.397
<i>HaiI MotherIand!</i>

01:08:39.312 --> 01:08:40.779
This is Mr. Kulada.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.575
Greetings.

01:08:42.682 --> 01:08:43.774
Please follow me.

01:08:49.456 --> 01:08:52.391
Were those stolen from the villagers?

01:08:59.232 --> 01:09:00.699
Have a seat.

01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:06.063
You may enjoy your bonfire, but the villagers
will file a complaint against you.

01:09:08.341 --> 01:09:11.777
We'll set fire to their crops if they do.

01:09:13.046 --> 01:09:14.638
Can't we try picketing?

01:09:16.583 --> 01:09:18.175
We can make them understand.

01:09:18.685 --> 01:09:20.676
lt's worked in other places.

01:09:21.221 --> 01:09:23.382
l know what works and what doesn't.

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.685
Picketing won't work in Sukhsayar.

01:09:27.627 --> 01:09:29.458
Please sit, Mr. Kulada.

01:09:36.336 --> 01:09:38.497
A foreign brand, l see.

01:09:38.605 --> 01:09:41.472
Yes, it's the only exception
l make to Swadeshi.

01:09:41.574 --> 01:09:44.236
-- May l have one?
-- Be my guest.

01:09:47.447 --> 01:09:49.142
These people can't be persuaded, Amulya.

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:51.413
They've been pampered too much.

01:09:51.518 --> 01:09:58.890
Listen, l've been the manager of this estate
since the maharaja's father was alive.

01:10:00.593 --> 01:10:03.084
The father was a tough one.

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:05.426
The trouble is the son.

01:10:05.532 --> 01:10:07.557
lf only he'd been firm with them,

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:11.398
he could have brought
these villagers to their knees.

01:10:11.504 --> 01:10:14.337
lt would have been smooth sailing for you.

01:10:16.843 --> 01:10:19.903
Anyway, tell me how you can help us.

01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:25.240
lf you can't stop the influx
of foreign goods,

01:10:26.052 --> 01:10:29.488
you can't stop the trade of foreign goods.

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:34.617
Those boats bring the goods in.

01:10:35.662 --> 01:10:39.928
-- You'll have to deal with the boatmen first.
-- Can you do that for me?

01:10:41.134 --> 01:10:46.868
The problem is that the boatmen's
leader is very stubborn.

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:50.532
Who is he?
What's his name?

01:10:50.643 --> 01:10:54.340
Mirjan.
He's a hard nut to crack.

01:10:55.815 --> 01:10:59.512
-- Can he be persuaded?
-- Where there's a will, there's a way.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:06.120
A boat which sails
is also a boat which sinks.

01:11:09.662 --> 01:11:13.689
But it's going to take
more than words to do this job.

01:11:14.534 --> 01:11:17.230
lt will take...
-- Money?

01:11:17.837 --> 01:11:20.271
We have to stop tongues from wagging,

01:11:20.373 --> 01:11:23.934
pay compensation,
bribe the police.

01:11:24.043 --> 01:11:25.806
That all takes money.

01:11:29.115 --> 01:11:31.606
lt's not like we don't have any money,

01:11:31.718 --> 01:11:35.176
and more can be raised if necessary.

01:11:35.288 --> 01:11:38.382
Then you can rely on me.

01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:43.219
l'll do the dirty work,

01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:46.856
but if something goes wrong,

01:11:46.966 --> 01:11:48.763
you're on your own.

01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:54.096
You don't need to worry about that.

01:11:54.207 --> 01:11:56.937
Even so, if l get into any sort of trouble,

01:11:57.043 --> 01:11:59.739
l have no intention of taking all the blame.

01:12:07.854 --> 01:12:10.516
l'm keeping this letter you wrote me.

01:12:13.726 --> 01:12:15.785
<i>I didn't go.</i>

01:12:15.895 --> 01:12:17.829
<i>He asked for me.</i>

01:12:17.931 --> 01:12:23.096
<i>I gave an excuse and stayed inside,</i>
<i>but what good did it do?</i>

01:12:23.202 --> 01:12:27.161
<i>I was thinking of him aII day yesterday.</i>

01:12:27.273 --> 01:12:30.003
<i>Why shouId this happen to a woman</i>

01:12:30.109 --> 01:12:36.605
<i>who has never thought about any man</i>
<i>other than her own husband?</i>

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:39.848
Madam, how do you want
the fish prepared?

01:12:39.953 --> 01:12:41.818
You never told me.

01:12:42.789 --> 01:12:44.984
Make a curry with ground mustard seed.

01:12:53.866 --> 01:12:54.992
<i>Madam?</i>

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.562
Yes, Nanku?

01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:00.866
<i>There's a Ietter for you.</i>

01:13:05.878 --> 01:13:08.870
OUR STRUGGLE

01:13:10.116 --> 01:13:12.050
Are you feeling any better?

01:13:13.987 --> 01:13:14.851
Yes.

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:19.148
This boy from our group
was very eager to meet you.

01:13:22.829 --> 01:13:25.764
You met me once before when l was little.

01:13:25.865 --> 01:13:27.560
l came with my mother.

01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:30.192
-- What's your mother's name?
-- Soudamini Devi.

01:13:32.005 --> 01:13:35.941
-- Are you Nibaron Ghosal's son?
-- Yes. My name is Amulya.

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:40.677
-- How old are you?
-- Seventeen.

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.248
l was about to take
my final exam, but l didn't.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.943
Because of Swadeshi?

01:13:46.052 --> 01:13:47.952
Amulya is very hardworking.

01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:50.889
He remembers the entire <i>Bhagavadgita.</i>

01:13:51.724 --> 01:13:53.521
Really?

01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:55.894
Here it is.

01:13:55.995 --> 01:13:58.896
-- Do you always carry it with you?
-- Always.

01:13:58.998 --> 01:14:02.525
The <i>Bhagavadgita</i> gives one courage
to overcome one's fears.

01:14:02.635 --> 01:14:04.762
Even to die for one's country.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.908
Aren't you afraid to die?

01:14:10.009 --> 01:14:12.876
''For the soul, there is neither birth
nor death at any time.

01:14:12.979 --> 01:14:16.244
He has not come into being, does not come
into being, and will not come into being.

01:14:16.349 --> 01:14:19.443
He is unborn, eternal,
ever--existing and primeval.

01:14:19.552 --> 01:14:22.578
He is not slain when the body is slain.''

01:14:22.688 --> 01:14:25.020
Even when a man dies,
his soul lives on.

01:14:25.124 --> 01:14:27.592
Okay, Amulya.
You may go now.

01:14:29.662 --> 01:14:32.096
Mr. Sandip said you believe in Swadeshi.

01:14:32.198 --> 01:14:34.564
l wanted to pay my respects.

01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:35.964
l'll take my leave, sister.

01:14:36.936 --> 01:14:39.427
l'll come again.
-- Please do.

01:14:39.539 --> 01:14:40.836
Hail Motherland.

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:44.438
-- Hail Motherland.
-- Good--bye.

01:14:55.888 --> 01:14:57.583
What are you thinking?

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:02.258
ls there any danger to your life
in the work you do?

01:15:05.198 --> 01:15:06.688
Well...

01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:12.767
Since we're fighting against
the powerful British government,

01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:16.265
of course there is.

01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:26.108
But my boys are brave.

01:15:27.753 --> 01:15:29.516
My courage doesn't begin to match theirs.

01:15:29.622 --> 01:15:32.216
That's a strange confession from a leader.

01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:37.861
Sometimes the truth comes out.

01:15:42.902 --> 01:15:44.836
Now will you tell me the truth?

01:15:46.405 --> 01:15:47.667
What truth?

01:15:49.008 --> 01:15:51.272
After so many years,

01:15:51.377 --> 01:15:54.107
why did you suddenly decide
to come out of your confinement?

01:15:54.814 --> 01:15:57.044
Don't you know why?

01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:59.315
How would l know?

01:15:59.418 --> 01:16:01.386
You should know.

01:16:02.555 --> 01:16:06.457
You should, but you're a man.

01:16:06.559 --> 01:16:08.550
You don't have a woman's intuition.

01:16:10.496 --> 01:16:11.724
Will you tell me?

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:29.908
Why?

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:42.583
l'd never been face--to--face
with a leader before.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:48.632
l fear the leader may have let you down.

01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:59.371
Not so far.

01:17:23.269 --> 01:17:24.827
You play the piano too?

01:17:26.405 --> 01:17:28.396
l was taking lessons.

01:17:28.741 --> 01:17:30.106
Piano...

01:17:31.143 --> 01:17:32.735
singing.

01:17:33.646 --> 01:17:35.409
English songs?

01:18:07.747 --> 01:18:09.544
You didn't come yesterday.

01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:15.086
l had a feeling you weren't really ill.

01:18:15.855 --> 01:18:18.585
l racked my brain all day trying to guess...

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:26.224
what l had done or said to annoy you.

01:18:28.701 --> 01:18:32.193
You still haven't told me
why you called.

01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:35.102
l just wanted to see you.

01:18:36.676 --> 01:18:38.405
ls that the only reason?

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.573
l didn't see you yesterday,

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:46.277
and it turned out
to be a dismal day for me.

01:18:46.819 --> 01:18:49.151
My pride as a leader...

01:18:50.122 --> 01:18:51.714
was badly shaken.

01:18:52.692 --> 01:18:54.785
The people won't listen to you?

01:18:55.261 --> 01:18:58.594
Sometimes words are not enough.

01:18:58.698 --> 01:19:02.691
-- What do you do then?
-- l try other ways.

01:19:03.369 --> 01:19:04.836
May l know what ways?

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:08.896
Because my husband's
not going to help you.

01:19:13.312 --> 01:19:14.506
Nikhil said so?

01:19:23.289 --> 01:19:25.553
Do you know what l feel
like doing sometimes?

01:19:26.392 --> 01:19:28.292
To hell with Swadeshi.

01:19:28.861 --> 01:19:31.694
l'll spend my life
chatting with the queen bee.

01:19:33.599 --> 01:19:35.157
With me?

01:19:35.634 --> 01:19:36.601
Chatting?

01:19:37.837 --> 01:19:39.600
Would that bother you?

01:19:43.042 --> 01:19:44.509
Why are you laughing?

01:19:45.077 --> 01:19:47.773
That's so absurd.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.941
You're not the type to spend
even an hour chatting.

01:19:55.087 --> 01:19:56.554
You're right.

01:19:58.190 --> 01:19:59.589
The truth is...

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.555
l need Swadeshi...

01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:06.030
just as much as l need you.

01:20:08.734 --> 01:20:11.794
l don't want you to stop
fighting for the country.

01:20:12.972 --> 01:20:17.272
My husband and l don't see
eye to eye on that matter.

01:20:17.743 --> 01:20:22.305
He has many virtues,
and l admire him for that.

01:20:22.982 --> 01:20:29.114
But, for a man, he is much too placid.

01:20:29.221 --> 01:20:32.657
A person can't afford to be so placid
at a time like this.

01:20:36.195 --> 01:20:38.891
l agree with you entirely.

01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:44.696
My husband says
you don't care about the poor,

01:20:44.804 --> 01:20:48.171
so you can't really do
any good for our country.

01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:54.742
l don't believe you would hurt the poor.

01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:58.546
You'll try to persuade them.
That's all.

01:21:05.024 --> 01:21:06.958
But the problem is...

01:21:09.395 --> 01:21:11.829
persuasion doesn't always work.

01:21:13.866 --> 01:21:17.358
You need something more.
-- What do you need?

01:21:20.973 --> 01:21:24.136
-- Let's not talk about that.
-- l want to know.

01:21:25.511 --> 01:21:28.036
l don't want to talk
about mundane things with you.

01:21:28.147 --> 01:21:29.546
Why?

01:21:31.984 --> 01:21:35.181
l want no note of discord
in our relationship.

01:21:36.155 --> 01:21:38.715
But l'd be really happy to help.

01:21:40.426 --> 01:21:41.723
This is beyond you, queen bee.

01:21:42.828 --> 01:21:45.023
Haven't you seen me going beyond?

01:21:46.165 --> 01:21:50.625
l know how far you can go.
Even so, l'd rather not talk about it.

01:21:50.736 --> 01:21:52.465
lt's a personal request.

01:21:53.572 --> 01:21:58.771
Then there's no reason for me to stay.

01:21:59.545 --> 01:22:01.012
l'm leaving.

01:22:01.113 --> 01:22:05.015
Queen bee, please don't leave angry!

01:22:05.117 --> 01:22:09.611
lf l can't help you with Swadeshi,
then l'm just wasting my time here.

01:22:09.722 --> 01:22:12.190
l just didn't want you to worry about me.

01:22:12.825 --> 01:22:15.521
Must we only talk about politics?

01:22:15.628 --> 01:22:17.095
Only about my work?

01:22:17.696 --> 01:22:21.154
Promise me you'll tell me
if you need money,

01:22:21.267 --> 01:22:24.236
and you'll take it if l give it to you.

01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:26.394
l promise, queen bee.

01:22:27.039 --> 01:22:28.802
l promise.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.541
Queen bee?

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:34.077
l'll come again this evening.
Please wait for me here.

01:22:34.547 --> 01:22:37.038
l hate having to send for you every time.

01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:39.175
Let go of me.

01:22:39.285 --> 01:22:43.346
Promise me you'll come to me every day.

01:22:44.323 --> 01:22:47.121
l must see you at least once a day.

01:22:48.394 --> 01:22:50.726
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:53.362
Promise me.

01:22:53.465 --> 01:22:55.160
All right.

01:22:56.969 --> 01:23:01.065
Please let go of my hand.
l want to go.

01:23:24.863 --> 01:23:27.331
Khemi, clean the room later.

01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:48.573
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

01:24:55.154 --> 01:24:57.213
Back so soon?

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.223
What are you staring at?

01:25:05.431 --> 01:25:07.524
What is there to stare at but you?

01:25:08.634 --> 01:25:10.829
l've never seen anything like it.

01:25:12.104 --> 01:25:14.038
Such tender concern for our guest.

01:25:14.473 --> 01:25:16.839
He'll never want to leave.

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:23.071
ln my day, we had to look
after our husbands too.

01:25:25.517 --> 01:25:29.578
lf only my brother--in--law
were a guest in his own house,

01:25:30.289 --> 01:25:32.120
he'd be warmly welcomed.

01:25:32.224 --> 01:25:35.193
l don't want any advice from you.

01:25:40.632 --> 01:25:43.795
l was just a small girl
when l came here as a bride.

01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:49.132
Your husband was
my playmate in those days.

01:25:51.043 --> 01:25:52.738
Where were you then?

01:25:52.845 --> 01:25:55.973
There's no need to repeat
what l already know.

01:26:00.986 --> 01:26:03.454
He was the only one
who understood my pain.

01:26:03.555 --> 01:26:05.113
He used to say,

01:26:05.824 --> 01:26:08.486
''We're still living in the Dark Ages.

01:26:09.161 --> 01:26:11.254
That's why you're suffering like this.

01:26:12.931 --> 01:26:16.958
For you, having a husband
is just as painful as losing one.''

01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:22.532
''My wife will be a free woman,'' he'd say.

01:26:25.744 --> 01:26:28.713
Well, now l see that free woman
before my very eyes.

01:26:32.985 --> 01:26:35.146
But don't forget,

01:26:36.155 --> 01:26:38.180
there's a God above us, dear sister.

01:26:38.724 --> 01:26:42.182
He can see you too.

01:26:55.507 --> 01:26:57.941
<i>I beIieved I had the strength to bear</i>

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:03.707
<i>whatever misfortune</i>
<i>fate had in store for me.</i>

01:27:04.183 --> 01:27:09.712
<i>I wouId caII up visions of suffering</i>
<i>and steeI myseIf against them.</i>

01:27:10.489 --> 01:27:12.457
<i>Visions of poverty,</i>

01:27:12.558 --> 01:27:16.392
<i>dishonor or death.</i>

01:27:17.095 --> 01:27:20.622
<i>I even imagined BimaIa's death.</i>

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.258
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>I couId never imagine happening.</i>

01:27:26.438 --> 01:27:30.397
<i>Now I keep asking myseIf</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:33.537
<i>Do I have the strength to bear this?</i>

01:27:34.813 --> 01:27:39.079
-- Hail Motherland!
-- Hail Motherland!

01:27:59.171 --> 01:28:03.699
-- What do you want?
-- We have some questions.

01:28:03.809 --> 01:28:04.969
What are they?

01:28:05.077 --> 01:28:08.308
Why don't you ban
foreign goods in our market?

01:28:08.413 --> 01:28:11.576
-- l have my reasons.
-- ls it because you would lose money?

01:28:13.952 --> 01:28:18.184
l wouldn't, but the poor would.

01:28:18.557 --> 01:28:20.286
But our nation will profit.

01:28:20.392 --> 01:28:24.385
We buy domestic salt, sugar and clothing.

01:28:24.496 --> 01:28:26.191
How can you say that?

01:28:26.999 --> 01:28:29.627
How can you compare
yourselves with the poor?

01:28:30.102 --> 01:28:32.036
You have money.

01:28:32.137 --> 01:28:35.129
You can afford
to spend more on lndian goods.

01:28:36.675 --> 01:28:39.143
The poor aren't standing in your way.

01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:41.176
Why are you standing in theirs?

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:44.549
You want to oppose an entire nation
that's taken the Swadeshi oath?

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:45.446
Never.

01:28:46.485 --> 01:28:48.385
That's beyond my power.

01:28:49.087 --> 01:28:52.318
But how can you say
the entire nation has taken your oath?

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:54.888
Look at the evidence.

01:28:54.993 --> 01:28:57.393
Aren't the traders part of this nation?

01:28:57.496 --> 01:29:00.761
So you won't ban foreign goods?

01:29:02.367 --> 01:29:03.766
No,

01:29:04.269 --> 01:29:07.102
because those goods don't belong to me.

01:29:07.205 --> 01:29:08.900
Hail Motherland!

01:29:30.796 --> 01:29:32.195
What are you looking for?

01:29:33.565 --> 01:29:35.294
<i>PassifIora.</i>

01:29:36.668 --> 01:29:38.602
Didn't you have a vial?

01:29:40.339 --> 01:29:42.273
Are you having trouble sleeping?

01:29:44.042 --> 01:29:47.478
One sleeps less as one grows older,

01:29:48.413 --> 01:29:50.677
but these last three nights --

01:29:50.782 --> 01:29:52.943
Here it is.

01:29:53.051 --> 01:29:54.279
l found it.

01:29:54.386 --> 01:29:56.115
Please, keep the vial.

01:30:06.698 --> 01:30:09.132
l don't like this, Nikhil.

01:30:10.502 --> 01:30:17.101
l have grave misgivings
about the way things are shaping up.

01:30:17.909 --> 01:30:21.811
Sandip is your friend and your guest.

01:30:22.481 --> 01:30:24.881
Everybody knows that.

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:29.619
Soon they'll believe whatever he does
is done with your sanction.

01:30:30.455 --> 01:30:35.757
Don't you realize how terrible
the consequences could be for you?

01:30:37.863 --> 01:30:40.457
l'm already feeling those consequences, sir.

01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:43.534
They think l'm a British lackey,

01:30:44.369 --> 01:30:48.897
that l don't force Swadeshi on my tenants
for fear they would stop paying rent.

01:30:49.007 --> 01:30:53.000
That's the propaganda.
-- Don't let it worry you.

01:30:53.512 --> 01:30:58.540
Nothing can touch you as long as
you have a clear conscience.

01:30:59.618 --> 01:31:03.349
But the situation is deteriorating.

01:31:04.823 --> 01:31:10.455
Muslim preachers from Dhaka are
going around stirring up the peasants.

01:31:10.996 --> 01:31:12.623
Have you heard about it?

01:31:13.765 --> 01:31:15.665
l've read about it in the papers.

01:31:15.767 --> 01:31:18.600
What's to stop them from coming here?

01:31:19.538 --> 01:31:22.371
-- Nothing.
-- And then?

01:31:24.276 --> 01:31:26.141
But if anything does happen,

01:31:27.045 --> 01:31:31.379
can we place all the blame
on the preachers?

01:31:32.217 --> 01:31:34.344
We are also responsible.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.213
How can we just ignore that?

01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:41.953
Think about how we ourselves
have treated the poor Muslims.

01:31:43.095 --> 01:31:47.293
Have we even respected
their rights as human beings?

01:31:47.399 --> 01:31:50.994
That's true, but what
can be done about it now?

01:31:54.606 --> 01:31:55.834
l'll go there.

01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:59.939
l want to see for myself.

01:32:01.113 --> 01:32:03.809
Rumors can be misleading.

01:32:03.915 --> 01:32:07.578
Nikhil, can't you inform the magistrate?

01:32:08.253 --> 01:32:10.847
l don't think he'd mind a riot.

01:32:11.656 --> 01:32:13.954
lt's an easy way for him
to see the Swadeshi punished.

01:32:14.059 --> 01:32:16.527
There is one thing you can do.

01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:21.556
You can at least eradicate
the source of the trouble.

01:32:22.434 --> 01:32:24.868
Why let Sandip stay?

01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:35.177
l thought he'd leave of his own accord.

01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:39.549
But now --

01:32:40.252 --> 01:32:42.584
Leave? Why would he?

01:32:43.722 --> 01:32:46.919
With all the comfort
and protection he enjoys here?

01:32:47.359 --> 01:32:52.922
Besides, you've done him a special favor
by introducing him to your wife.

01:32:53.031 --> 01:32:55.591
He's taking full advantage of that!

01:32:56.101 --> 01:32:59.628
l had no idea he had changed so much.

01:32:59.738 --> 01:33:05.370
All this adulation has gone to his head.

01:33:07.345 --> 01:33:12.715
l think it comes from
a deep sense of frustration.

01:33:14.152 --> 01:33:16.848
Despite all his gifts,

01:33:17.722 --> 01:33:20.088
he hasn't really accomplished anything.

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:26.354
Sometimes, l feel pity for him.

01:33:26.464 --> 01:33:29.262
This is no time for pity, Nikhil.

01:33:29.968 --> 01:33:34.530
You can't bring yourself to be firm
with him because he's close to you.

01:33:34.639 --> 01:33:36.607
You're hesitating.

01:33:36.975 --> 01:33:41.537
But l fail to see why you're
vacillating at a time like this.

01:33:42.547 --> 01:33:44.310
You would if l told you.

01:33:46.184 --> 01:33:48.049
But l can't.

01:36:37.355 --> 01:36:38.879
Remember this?

01:36:47.198 --> 01:36:49.792
lt's from my soap factory.

01:36:54.639 --> 01:36:58.131
You saved it?
-- Not just the soap.

01:37:00.445 --> 01:37:04.176
Towels, pens, matches.
l kept everything.

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.244
Have you ever used it?

01:37:13.691 --> 01:37:18.253
lt's no good for anything,
not even for washing clothes.

01:37:24.369 --> 01:37:26.963
What foolish notions l had back then.

01:37:27.071 --> 01:37:28.766
You still do.

01:37:30.008 --> 01:37:34.035
You freed her from her moorings.
Now look where she's drifted.

01:37:37.081 --> 01:37:40.676
-- That was no foolish notion.
-- You still think so?

01:37:46.858 --> 01:37:49.554
lf she likes what she's doing,

01:37:50.662 --> 01:37:52.755
then that's the kind of person she is.

01:37:53.965 --> 01:37:56.229
l could prevent her from going out,

01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:59.265
but that wouldn't change who she is.

01:38:00.772 --> 01:38:02.535
She's not a child.

01:38:03.074 --> 01:38:04.564
lsn't the husband the master?

01:38:07.278 --> 01:38:09.974
Bending her to my will wouldn't be difficult,

01:38:10.248 --> 01:38:11.545
but it wouldn't help.

01:38:13.218 --> 01:38:15.243
At least get rid of him.

01:38:16.387 --> 01:38:19.220
He's not much of a friend, is he?

01:38:20.658 --> 01:38:25.618
lt would certainly be better for my estate

01:38:26.564 --> 01:38:28.794
if he were to leave.

01:38:30.034 --> 01:38:33.834
But l'm a selfish person.

01:38:36.908 --> 01:38:40.366
l can't stop thinking about myself.
l just can't help it.

01:38:42.013 --> 01:38:45.073
lf he leaves, you'll soon find her
back by your side.

01:38:46.551 --> 01:38:48.041
l know.

01:38:49.354 --> 01:38:54.553
But l would find her regretting it,

01:38:55.894 --> 01:39:00.490
because it wouldn't be her decision.

01:39:01.633 --> 01:39:03.658
That would be unbearable,

01:39:04.903 --> 01:39:06.894
both for her...

01:39:07.839 --> 01:39:10.330
and for me.

01:39:14.712 --> 01:39:16.737
l can't do it.

01:39:16.881 --> 01:39:19.179
Hail Motherland!

01:40:07.865 --> 01:40:09.833
<i>HaiI MotherIand.</i>

01:40:09.934 --> 01:40:11.629
What happened?

01:40:11.736 --> 01:40:16.002
Why are you so late?
-- lt was a lot of work.

01:40:16.774 --> 01:40:18.969
There's a play in Chandrapur tonight.

01:40:19.077 --> 01:40:21.807
l had to wait for the boatmen to go there.

01:40:21.913 --> 01:40:25.644
This kind of work can't be done
if there are people around.

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:27.741
Mirjan's boat?

01:40:31.055 --> 01:40:35.219
But when he comes back
and finds his boat missing,

01:40:35.326 --> 01:40:37.260
it won't take him long
to put two and two together,

01:40:37.362 --> 01:40:41.264
and then he'll come groveling to you.

01:40:41.532 --> 01:40:45.593
You'll have to give him some compensation.

01:40:46.537 --> 01:40:50.906
Keep around 5,000 rupees handy.

01:40:54.345 --> 01:40:57.371
-- Let me see.
-- A word of advice.

01:40:58.683 --> 01:41:03.382
Can l be frank with you?

01:41:03.488 --> 01:41:05.422
Out with it. lt's late.

01:41:06.224 --> 01:41:11.753
l think you should finish things up
quickly here and leave.

01:41:15.299 --> 01:41:18.666
-- Why?
-- Things aren't looking good.

01:41:19.203 --> 01:41:21.171
There could be a riot.

01:41:21.639 --> 01:41:23.300
You may be a leader,

01:41:23.408 --> 01:41:28.277
but you're not exactly
a popular one, you know.

01:41:28.713 --> 01:41:32.877
They're certainly not going
to put you on a pedestal.

01:41:36.854 --> 01:41:39.652
l'll decide what to do.

01:41:40.024 --> 01:41:42.618
You don't need to worry about it.

01:41:46.964 --> 01:41:50.832
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

01:41:50.935 --> 01:41:54.701
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

01:41:54.806 --> 01:41:58.674
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

01:41:58.776 --> 01:42:02.405
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

01:42:02.513 --> 01:42:06.313
<i>The strong, the brave, the proud</i>

01:42:06.417 --> 01:42:10.251
<i>To serve the nation's cause</i>

01:42:10.354 --> 01:42:14.051
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

01:42:14.158 --> 01:42:18.356
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

01:42:19.964 --> 01:42:22.398
You should give up Swadeshi
and take up singing.

01:42:23.034 --> 01:42:28.267
l once considered becoming an actor.

01:42:28.639 --> 01:42:32.268
lt's wonderful to be able to hold
a large audience in your grip.

01:42:33.411 --> 01:42:37.142
l was thinking that when l heard
you speak the other evening.

01:42:38.449 --> 01:42:40.144
Of course...

01:42:40.585 --> 01:42:45.420
it's nothing like winning
the heart of a woman.

01:42:47.191 --> 01:42:50.786
l gather you've won
the hearts of many women,

01:42:51.362 --> 01:42:53.023
both Swadeshi...

01:42:53.931 --> 01:42:55.330
and foreign.

01:42:55.433 --> 01:42:57.196
Good God!

01:42:57.468 --> 01:42:59.561
Has Nikhil told you all this?

01:43:00.538 --> 01:43:02.768
You know so much about me.

01:43:02.874 --> 01:43:04.842
Why shouldn't l know something about you?

01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:07.603
You know what they were?

01:43:07.712 --> 01:43:11.273
Youthful indiscretions.
lt's ancient history.

01:43:12.016 --> 01:43:14.780
l wonder what happened to those women.

01:43:15.319 --> 01:43:17.048
You shouldn't, queen bee.

01:43:17.155 --> 01:43:20.784
l'm no longer the same person.
You know that.

01:43:21.559 --> 01:43:24.357
Still, it's helpful in understanding
a person's character.

01:43:25.163 --> 01:43:27.723
lt's not difficult to understand men.

01:43:27.832 --> 01:43:29.766
lt's women who are unfathomable.

01:43:30.234 --> 01:43:33.328
One despairs of knowing their minds.

01:43:33.437 --> 01:43:36.634
You know that song, don't you?
-- What song?

01:43:37.508 --> 01:43:43.447
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:43:43.548 --> 01:43:46.984
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:43:47.084 --> 01:43:50.315
<i>Her siIence means more</i>
<i>than what she says</i>

01:43:50.421 --> 01:43:52.753
<i>She Iooks at you,</i>
<i>then drops her eyes</i>

01:43:52.857 --> 01:43:55.223
<i>Her siIence means more</i>
<i>than what she says</i>

01:43:55.326 --> 01:43:57.692
<i>She Iooks at you,</i>
<i>then drops her eyes</i>

01:43:57.795 --> 01:44:00.263
<i>She Iaughs one moment</i>
<i>The next she cries</i>

01:44:01.265 --> 01:44:03.631
<i>She Iaughs one moment</i>
<i>The next she cries</i>

01:44:03.734 --> 01:44:07.192
<i>She Iingers cIose,</i>
<i>then Ieaves you in a daze</i>

01:44:07.305 --> 01:44:13.301
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:44:13.411 --> 01:44:16.869
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:44:17.481 --> 01:44:20.678
ls that why you never married?

01:44:21.752 --> 01:44:26.951
How can l marry if l can't find a woman
after my own heart, queen bee?

01:44:27.058 --> 01:44:30.323
l waited a long time for you last night.

01:44:30.595 --> 01:44:32.392
You never came.

01:44:34.832 --> 01:44:36.823
Forgive me, my queen bee.

01:44:37.568 --> 01:44:40.560
l was very busy.
l got back late.

01:44:40.671 --> 01:44:45.438
-- Busy with what?
-- The Swadeshi cause, of course.

01:44:45.543 --> 01:44:48.637
-- Giving speeches?
-- No.

01:44:48.746 --> 01:44:50.373
What, then?

01:44:51.349 --> 01:44:53.874
Winding things up.

01:44:54.986 --> 01:44:57.819
l can't stay here forever, you know.

01:44:59.156 --> 01:45:01.624
We have to be constantly
on the move, campaigning.

01:45:04.762 --> 01:45:06.957
You're leaving?

01:45:08.833 --> 01:45:10.596
l have to go sooner or later.

01:45:13.905 --> 01:45:16.373
What if your queen bee doesn't let you?

01:45:20.144 --> 01:45:22.738
No one would be happier than me.

01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:25.876
But l'm not planning on leaving just yet.

01:45:25.983 --> 01:45:27.848
There are still problems to be resolved.

01:45:29.487 --> 01:45:31.955
-- Will you tell me?
-- What?

01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:34.648
How much money do you need?

01:45:42.533 --> 01:45:44.091
What is it?

01:45:45.336 --> 01:45:46.769
How much?

01:45:47.605 --> 01:45:49.470
About five thousand.

01:45:49.573 --> 01:45:52.041
We spent more
than we were planning to.

01:45:52.143 --> 01:45:56.307
lf l get you the money,
you'll have to take it without question.

01:45:57.748 --> 01:46:01.479
lf you say so, but you mustn't
part with your jewelry.

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.986
When l said money,
l meant money.

01:46:08.159 --> 01:46:09.649
What if l can't repay you?

01:46:10.594 --> 01:46:12.721
l don't expect you to.

01:46:13.164 --> 01:46:15.962
Can't l at least do this much for Swadeshi?

01:46:18.002 --> 01:46:21.130
-- l'm worried, queen bee.
-- Why?

01:46:22.807 --> 01:46:25.571
l seem to have become a burden to you.

01:46:25.676 --> 01:46:29.976
But there's no other way. l can explain.
-- You don't have to.

01:46:30.414 --> 01:46:35.374
Just tell me one thing.
-- What?

01:46:36.721 --> 01:46:40.885
-- lf l give you the money, will you stay?
-- Do you think l want to leave you?

01:46:43.194 --> 01:46:45.856
Then why did you say
you were going to leave?

01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:49.861
After all the torment l've been through.

01:46:49.967 --> 01:46:52.765
l did it all for you,

01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:55.134
and you --

01:46:56.407 --> 01:46:57.806
Queen bee.

01:47:47.892 --> 01:47:49.416
<i>Brothers!</i>

01:47:50.227 --> 01:47:54.857
<i>The Hindus ask you to join hands</i>
<i>with them for the Swadeshi cause.</i>

01:47:55.232 --> 01:47:57.632
<i>They wheedIe you.</i>

01:47:57.902 --> 01:48:00.029
<i>They coax you.</i>

01:48:00.137 --> 01:48:02.002
<i>They even threaten you.</i>

01:48:02.106 --> 01:48:05.166
<i>They want you to join them at aII costs,</i>
<i>but don't Iisten to them, brothers.</i>

01:48:05.276 --> 01:48:08.268
<i>Remember they don't want our betterment.</i>

01:48:08.946 --> 01:48:13.474
<i>The Hindus don't care about your weII-being.</i>

01:48:13.984 --> 01:48:19.581
<i>Whatever they say is not</i>
<i>for the benefit of our community.</i>

01:48:19.690 --> 01:48:23.649
<i>The Hindus have never</i>
<i>cared about our weII-being.</i>

01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:27.458
<i>The Hindus want to keep us MusIims</i>
<i>under their heeIs forever.</i>

01:48:27.565 --> 01:48:30.966
<i>That is their onIy objective.</i>

01:48:32.269 --> 01:48:35.432
<i>But remember one thing.</i>

01:48:35.539 --> 01:48:40.670
<i>By the grace of AIIah,</i>
<i>MusIims are the majority in BengaI.</i>

01:48:40.778 --> 01:48:42.905
<i>You are the farmers.</i>

01:48:43.013 --> 01:48:47.040
<i>The weaIth of this country</i>
<i>comes from its Iand.</i>

01:48:47.151 --> 01:48:49.142
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:54.384
<i>No part of this weaIth</i>
<i>is produced by the Hindus.</i>

01:48:54.492 --> 01:48:58.360
<i>It's your hard work that made them weaIthy.</i>

01:48:58.996 --> 01:49:04.093
<i>They have no right</i>
<i>to the fruits of your Iabors.</i>

01:49:04.201 --> 01:49:06.362
This is your hard--earned money.

01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:09.871
The Hindus have no right to it.

01:49:10.674 --> 01:49:13.165
Listen to me, brother Muslims.

01:49:13.911 --> 01:49:16.505
Don't listen to the Hindus.

01:49:16.881 --> 01:49:19.611
Don't get mixed up in their politics.

01:49:19.717 --> 01:49:21.514
Swadeshi is not for you.

01:49:23.654 --> 01:49:28.182
You are the leaders
of the Hindu community in Sukhsayar.

01:49:29.093 --> 01:49:33.462
l've called you here to tell you one thing.

01:49:34.565 --> 01:49:38.592
You are men of wisdom
and good judgment.

01:49:39.236 --> 01:49:42.137
l think you will appreciate
what l am going to say to you.

01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:44.071
l have faith in you.

01:49:45.209 --> 01:49:47.439
l just wanted to say...

01:49:48.679 --> 01:49:51.910
that we can stay true
to our own religious beliefs,

01:49:52.616 --> 01:49:55.312
but we shouldn't interfere
with the beliefs of others.

01:49:56.687 --> 01:49:59.087
Even as a follower of <i>Vaishnavism,</i>

01:49:59.690 --> 01:50:03.182
l can't prevent a follower of <i>Shaktism</i>
from spilling the blood of animals.

01:50:03.994 --> 01:50:08.522
And so, similarly...

01:50:08.966 --> 01:50:12.094
we should let the Muslims
follow their own religious convictions.

01:50:12.203 --> 01:50:15.730
Maharaja, the Muslims in this village
never used to slaughter cows,

01:50:15.839 --> 01:50:20.139
but l've heard they do now.

01:50:20.244 --> 01:50:20.938
Yes.

01:50:22.413 --> 01:50:24.438
l've heard that too.

01:50:25.849 --> 01:50:30.479
But l strongly believe that
they've been manipulated into doing so.

01:50:30.921 --> 01:50:32.980
They've been convinced to do it,

01:50:33.557 --> 01:50:36.549
in order to stir up trouble
between our two religions.

01:50:38.796 --> 01:50:41.196
Please don't add fuel to the fire.

01:50:41.298 --> 01:50:44.324
They won't stop unless
you put them back in their place.

01:50:44.435 --> 01:50:46.335
The good old days are gone.

01:50:47.671 --> 01:50:49.104
Listen.

01:50:50.474 --> 01:50:52.942
Muslims are a part of lndia.

01:50:53.877 --> 01:50:57.278
This is a historical fact.

01:50:58.782 --> 01:51:01.307
You must accept this fact.

01:51:03.187 --> 01:51:08.022
We can't imagine an lndia without Muslims.

01:51:09.493 --> 01:51:11.393
lf we try to put them in their place,

01:51:11.895 --> 01:51:14.693
it won't stop them from slaughtering cows.

01:51:15.366 --> 01:51:18.062
lt may even lead to them slaughtering men.

01:51:21.038 --> 01:51:27.102
That's never been truer than now,
in the present state of unrest and turmoil.

01:51:28.512 --> 01:51:35.179
You now have a grave responsibility.

01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:43.954
l beg you, l beseech you,

01:51:45.429 --> 01:51:48.262
do not encourage hatred.

01:51:49.767 --> 01:51:55.399
lf you do so now,
you are courting disaster.

01:52:10.421 --> 01:52:12.412
Hail Motherland.

01:52:50.227 --> 01:52:51.717
Nikhil.

01:52:51.829 --> 01:52:55.162
Did you hear a shot?
-- Yes, l did.

01:52:56.233 --> 01:52:57.700
-- What now?
-- l know.

01:52:59.737 --> 01:53:01.932
l know what must be done.

01:53:02.206 --> 01:53:03.798
But first of all,

01:53:03.907 --> 01:53:07.809
take my carriage, go home
and come back with all your belongings.

01:53:08.112 --> 01:53:11.081
The roads aren't safe anymore.
l don't want anything to happen to you.

01:53:12.116 --> 01:53:14.141
That sounds fine, but --

01:53:15.753 --> 01:53:18.381
l'll tell Sandip right away.

01:53:48.719 --> 01:53:50.482
Time's running out, queen bee.

01:53:50.587 --> 01:53:52.612
l need the money now.

01:54:00.864 --> 01:54:02.491
What's that?

01:54:02.599 --> 01:54:04.226
Can't you guess?

01:54:05.502 --> 01:54:06.992
Money?

01:54:07.504 --> 01:54:11.031
So little? There can't be
more than 500 in those bags.

01:54:11.675 --> 01:54:15.042
You must have forgotten.
l asked for 5,000 rupees.

01:54:20.851 --> 01:54:22.443
What's this?

01:54:23.754 --> 01:54:24.948
Gold coins?

01:54:34.231 --> 01:54:35.562
Gold.

01:54:38.001 --> 01:54:40.231
Gold.

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.904
You should have told me.

01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:48.937
How else would l know?

01:54:51.448 --> 01:54:53.439
Please don't be angry, my queen bee.

01:55:00.357 --> 01:55:03.622
-- l need to talk to you.
-- About what?

01:55:04.461 --> 01:55:07.089
l don't want you to stay here any longer.

01:55:07.197 --> 01:55:09.290
Things have taken a serious turn.

01:55:09.399 --> 01:55:12.027
Your presence may make matters worse.

01:55:13.136 --> 01:55:15.502
l want you to leave Sukhsayar
by tomorrow morning.

01:55:17.641 --> 01:55:20.337
Am l supposed to take orders from you?

01:55:20.444 --> 01:55:21.911
lt's not that.

01:55:23.313 --> 01:55:26.180
lf you leave for Calcutta,
it will be good for you,

01:55:27.084 --> 01:55:28.551
and for Sukhsayar as well.

01:55:29.786 --> 01:55:33.244
-- l have no work to do in Calcutta.
-- All the more reason to go.

01:55:34.291 --> 01:55:36.851
You've done too much work here.

01:55:38.662 --> 01:55:41.460
Don't think l haven't been
informed of your activities.

01:55:42.299 --> 01:55:45.234
From setting fire to the peasants' barns
to sinking Mirjan's boat,

01:55:46.203 --> 01:55:48.797
l've been informed of everything.

01:55:50.073 --> 01:55:52.906
You speak of unity
between Hindus and Muslims,

01:55:53.644 --> 01:55:56.579
but, in fact, you oppress Muslims.

01:55:58.081 --> 01:56:00.311
l won't tolerate it anymore.

01:56:02.653 --> 01:56:05.144
l may not believe in Swadeshi,

01:56:06.156 --> 01:56:08.818
but l truly admire
some Swadeshi leaders.

01:56:09.927 --> 01:56:15.229
But l don't admire those
whose actions belie their words.

01:56:16.466 --> 01:56:19.060
You're not saving the country.
You're ruining it.

01:56:20.304 --> 01:56:23.273
l won't allow this to go on in my estate.

01:56:23.373 --> 01:56:27.002
There's only one person here
l'm prepared to obey.

01:56:29.279 --> 01:56:31.110
Queen bee...

01:56:31.615 --> 01:56:34.880
Do you want me to stay or not?

01:56:43.727 --> 01:56:45.251
Queen bee.

01:56:46.296 --> 01:56:48.594
l'm waiting for your answer.

01:56:50.233 --> 01:56:53.066
Do you want me to leave?

01:56:55.706 --> 01:56:57.674
Please tell me, queen bee.

01:56:59.209 --> 01:57:01.143
l've said what l came to say.

01:57:03.747 --> 01:57:06.113
l hope l won't have to repeat it.

01:57:10.721 --> 01:57:12.552
Queen bee.

01:57:14.825 --> 01:57:16.952
What's the matter with you?

01:57:20.697 --> 01:57:23.598
You suddenly --
-- ls Amulya in your room?

01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.565
-- Amulya?
-- Yes.

01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:26.693
Why?

01:57:26.803 --> 01:57:29.704
Send him to me. lt's urgent.

01:57:30.407 --> 01:57:33.035
Can't you tell me why?

01:57:33.343 --> 01:57:35.402
No, l'll tell Amulya.

01:57:35.512 --> 01:57:37.480
Please send him to me.

01:57:37.581 --> 01:57:39.640
lt's my request.

01:57:40.851 --> 01:57:42.580
Very well.

01:59:19.216 --> 01:59:20.615
Amulya?

01:59:23.053 --> 01:59:26.250
Can you do me a favor?
-- Of course. What is it?

01:59:26.356 --> 01:59:27.653
Go to Calcutta.

01:59:27.758 --> 01:59:30.556
You can take the morning train
and return in the evening.

01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:32.787
The money for the journey is in this box.

01:59:32.896 --> 01:59:35.956
-- What's this box?
-- lt's my jewelry box.

01:59:36.066 --> 01:59:39.729
l need 5,000 rupees. Sell some
of my jewelry and bring me the money.

01:59:39.836 --> 01:59:41.929
l don't need any jewelry.
l can get you the money.

01:59:42.038 --> 01:59:43.369
How?

01:59:43.473 --> 01:59:46.408
This is not a small amount
we're talking about.

01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:47.875
l'll get it.

01:59:47.978 --> 01:59:50.105
No, do as l tell you.

01:59:50.714 --> 01:59:53.683
But why did you give
Mr. Sandip 5,000 rupees?

01:59:53.784 --> 01:59:55.649
He said he needed that much.

01:59:55.752 --> 01:59:59.449
No, according to our calculations,
we only needed 3,500.

01:59:59.556 --> 02:00:01.956
lf you give him more,
he spends it on himself.

02:00:02.726 --> 02:00:06.526
He's quite a spender.
He always travels first--class.

02:00:07.631 --> 02:00:09.690
-- Sandip?
-- Yes, sister.

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:13.668
He says hardship saps a leader's strength.

02:00:14.504 --> 02:00:17.769
Well, l can't take back
what l've already given.

02:00:17.874 --> 02:00:20.707
He might need it in the future.
You get me the 5,000.

02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:24.678
Put the box away.
l'll get you the money tonight.

02:00:24.781 --> 02:00:26.715
-- How?
-- From the treasury.

02:00:27.717 --> 02:00:31.016
Are you insane?
What about the guards?

02:00:31.121 --> 02:00:33.146
We carry weapons, sister.

02:00:41.097 --> 02:00:43.258
Good heavens!

02:00:43.967 --> 02:00:46.026
Why are you upset, sister?

02:00:46.136 --> 02:00:48.229
We need funding
to carry out our work for the nation.

02:00:49.573 --> 02:00:51.541
Doesn't it bother you that you're stealing?

02:00:51.641 --> 02:00:53.541
Why?
Whose money is it?

02:00:53.643 --> 02:00:56.510
Mine today,
the moneylender's tomorrow.

02:00:56.613 --> 02:01:00.242
Why not use it for the cause?
-- No, Amulya.

02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:04.650
lf you go robbing treasuries,
l'll die of fear.

02:01:04.754 --> 02:01:07.018
Listen, you may not need
to sell all the jewelry.

02:01:07.123 --> 02:01:11.150
Sell as much as you need to
and bring back the rest.

02:01:12.162 --> 02:01:15.063
Take the box and carry it safely.

02:01:15.165 --> 02:01:18.066
And be careful, for heaven's sake.

02:01:19.002 --> 02:01:20.469
Very well, sister.

02:01:24.374 --> 02:01:26.740
l'll take my leave.
-- Okay.

02:01:50.767 --> 02:01:52.530
<i>Queen bee.</i>

02:02:02.212 --> 02:02:03.941
Are you leaving?

02:02:04.047 --> 02:02:06.311
ls there any reason for me to stay?

02:02:06.416 --> 02:02:08.407
Why do you say that?

02:02:08.518 --> 02:02:11.146
Can't you hear the note of discord?

02:02:12.188 --> 02:02:15.521
lf l've done anything wrong,
please forgive me.

02:02:15.625 --> 02:02:17.593
Don't leave like this.

02:02:18.128 --> 02:02:22.827
My husband said, ''The less one
knows you, the better one likes you''.

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.264
Perhaps l know you too well.

02:02:26.369 --> 02:02:28.269
Don't say that, queen bee.

02:02:28.705 --> 02:02:31.435
Has knowing me meant nothing to you?

02:02:31.708 --> 02:02:33.608
Has it all been in vain?

02:02:33.710 --> 02:02:36.907
l believed you would
succeed in your endeavor.

02:02:37.013 --> 02:02:38.913
l wanted you to.

02:02:39.015 --> 02:02:41.279
But not anymore?

02:03:07.344 --> 02:03:09.938
<i>AIIah is great!</i>

02:04:04.034 --> 02:04:06.002
Kasim?

02:04:12.942 --> 02:04:14.409
Hands up.

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:18.804
Hands up.

02:04:21.117 --> 02:04:22.311
Go inside.

02:04:22.419 --> 02:04:23.579
Go inside!

02:04:30.126 --> 02:04:31.320
Move.

02:04:33.797 --> 02:04:35.230
Turn around.

02:04:36.132 --> 02:04:37.724
Turn!

02:04:41.704 --> 02:04:43.638
Now open the safe.

02:04:44.307 --> 02:04:45.774
Open it!

02:04:50.814 --> 02:04:53.942
Take out 3,500 rupees.

02:04:54.717 --> 02:04:58.050
What's going on?
What's all the commotion?

02:04:58.321 --> 02:05:00.414
ls there a problem?

02:05:01.724 --> 02:05:03.453
l don't know.

02:05:04.127 --> 02:05:05.719
l hope it's not a riot.

02:05:05.829 --> 02:05:07.820
What are you saying?

02:05:08.164 --> 02:05:11.327
What will happen to us
if there's a riot here?

02:05:12.869 --> 02:05:15.064
We're going to Calcutta tomorrow.

02:05:15.905 --> 02:05:17.532
lt's no longer safe here.

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.438
Who is ''we''?
Am l not coming with you?

02:05:23.213 --> 02:05:25.113
Did l say that?

02:05:27.217 --> 02:05:29.082
l'm so relieved.

02:05:29.185 --> 02:05:31.312
A treasury was looted nearby.

02:05:31.421 --> 02:05:34.288
What's to stop them from looting this place?

02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:38.053
lf they kill me, they'll burn my body
by that shriveled banyan tree.

02:05:38.161 --> 02:05:39.719
That would be awful.

02:05:41.664 --> 02:05:43.461
Go and get ready.

02:05:43.566 --> 02:05:45.397
Pack your things.

02:05:47.137 --> 02:05:49.401
You're serious about leaving, aren't you?

02:05:50.006 --> 02:05:52.031
l'm always serious.

02:05:53.076 --> 02:05:55.044
Don't you know me by now?

02:06:19.335 --> 02:06:21.030
Bimala?

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:25.808
l have to tell you something.

02:06:25.909 --> 02:06:27.501
What is it?

02:06:27.777 --> 02:06:32.237
There were 5,000 rupees
in gold coins in two bags in the safe.

02:06:32.515 --> 02:06:34.449
l gave them to Sandip.

02:06:35.051 --> 02:06:36.985
He needed the money.

02:06:37.787 --> 02:06:41.689
Now you know how hard
it is to refuse him.

02:06:41.791 --> 02:06:43.190
l'll pay the money back.

02:06:43.693 --> 02:06:45.558
l gave Amulya my jewelry box.

02:06:45.662 --> 02:06:47.721
He'll sell my jewels and bring the money.

02:06:53.436 --> 02:06:58.635
l felt bad speaking to Sandip
like that in front of you.

02:07:01.077 --> 02:07:03.170
But l had to, Bimala.

02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:05.545
Things have taken a bad turn.

02:07:10.553 --> 02:07:13.488
lt's no longer safe for him to work here.

02:07:14.424 --> 02:07:16.949
But what about you?

02:07:20.663 --> 02:07:23.427
Your safety is what concerns me.

02:07:23.833 --> 02:07:27.428
No one else matters to me anymore.

02:07:28.238 --> 02:07:31.435
Tomorrow, we're going to Calcutta.

02:07:32.008 --> 02:07:33.737
All three of us.

02:07:34.777 --> 02:07:37.302
And if something happens before then?

02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:41.808
You won't leave the house, will you?

02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:48.448
lf something happens,
l'll have to go and intervene, Bimala.

02:07:53.263 --> 02:07:54.821
l knew it.

02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:00.431
l knew l'd be punished.

02:08:01.537 --> 02:08:03.971
l'll be punished.

02:08:07.143 --> 02:08:09.008
Punished? Why, Bimala?

02:08:09.879 --> 02:08:12.439
You haven't done anything wrong.

02:08:13.983 --> 02:08:18.852
l don't even have the right
to ask you for forgiveness.

02:08:21.090 --> 02:08:24.617
But you've come back to me,
haven't you?

02:08:25.862 --> 02:08:28.160
Haven't you, Bimala?

02:08:36.406 --> 02:08:41.105
lt seems like ages since l last
looked at you and spoke to you.

02:08:43.079 --> 02:08:45.172
What came over me?

02:08:45.915 --> 02:08:48.440
Why did this happen?

02:08:50.286 --> 02:08:52.083
You've done nothing wrong, Bimala.

02:08:53.122 --> 02:08:56.455
For ten years, you never saw
another man besides me.

02:08:58.361 --> 02:09:00.352
Don't forget that.

02:09:32.428 --> 02:09:34.623
There's 3,500 rupees here.

02:09:35.531 --> 02:09:38.762
Please return the jewelry box
and the gold coins.

02:09:40.036 --> 02:09:43.369
Where did you get that money?
Where have you been?

02:09:44.273 --> 02:09:46.264
To the treasury.

02:09:47.377 --> 02:09:48.605
l hope nobody saw you.

02:09:56.853 --> 02:09:58.718
l had my face covered.

02:09:59.055 --> 02:10:01.990
Did you see any trouble in the village?
-- There's a riot.

02:10:04.093 --> 02:10:07.290
The Muslims have broken
into the temple of Visalakshi.

02:10:17.774 --> 02:10:19.537
Are you leaving?

02:10:21.144 --> 02:10:22.771
Yes. To Rangpur.

02:10:28.117 --> 02:10:29.311
Will you come with me?

02:10:42.999 --> 02:10:44.398
l must go now.

02:10:52.675 --> 02:10:54.302
Hail Motherland.

02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:12.418
What are you thinking?

02:11:13.663 --> 02:11:15.324
Nothing.

02:11:16.999 --> 02:11:19.467
l don't want to think.

02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:22.763
l want to forget.

02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:27.503
Everything that's happened
in the last few days.

02:11:27.977 --> 02:11:30.878
Forget? But why?

02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:31.742
Nikhil!

02:11:35.284 --> 02:11:37.275
Come in, Sandip.

02:11:40.456 --> 02:11:42.686
This is the age of breaking rules.

02:11:43.426 --> 02:11:45.621
Your wife came out of her confinement,

02:11:45.728 --> 02:11:47.628
and now l've invaded
the privacy of your bedroom.

02:11:47.730 --> 02:11:49.664
l hope you'll forgive me.

02:11:52.134 --> 02:11:56.230
These are your property,
which l duly return.

02:11:57.006 --> 02:11:59.873
One jewelry box
and two bags of gold coins.

02:12:00.877 --> 02:12:02.344
The jewelry box?

02:12:03.112 --> 02:12:06.878
Your devotee didn't take it with him,
but he brought me the money.

02:12:10.286 --> 02:12:15.223
Since you have your valuables, l hope
you won't mind me keeping the money.

02:12:15.324 --> 02:12:17.622
-- Are you leaving?
-- Yes, Nikhil.

02:12:18.594 --> 02:12:21.222
The train to Rangpur leaves in an hour.

02:12:23.432 --> 02:12:26.731
Do you hear that?
The riots have started.

02:12:26.836 --> 02:12:28.565
Amulya saw them.

02:12:28.871 --> 02:12:33.467
And now l must make
my proverbial escape.

02:12:33.776 --> 02:12:35.107
l must live.

02:12:35.878 --> 02:12:38.108
l have a lot of work left to do.

02:12:38.381 --> 02:12:40.906
Don't make the same mistake again.

02:12:41.017 --> 02:12:43.281
Can't you see the results of your actions?

02:12:44.253 --> 02:12:46.448
l follow the <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> Nikhil.

02:12:46.722 --> 02:12:50.658
l am concerned only
with the action, not the result.

02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:55.060
And l consider Ravana to be
the hero of Ramayana, not Rama.

02:12:55.164 --> 02:12:58.099
So l can't accept advice
from the followers of Rama.

02:12:59.235 --> 02:13:01.135
The easy road isn't for me, Nikhil.

02:13:02.805 --> 02:13:04.500
l'll take my leave.

02:13:09.879 --> 02:13:11.972
This will stay with me.

02:13:17.286 --> 02:13:19.277
l'm keeping this as a memento.

02:13:20.289 --> 02:13:22.621
Who knows if we'll ever meet again?

02:13:25.394 --> 02:13:26.691
Good--bye, Nikhil.

02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:32.958
Queen bee.

02:13:39.041 --> 02:13:41.339
Hail Motherland.

02:14:17.013 --> 02:14:18.913
Courage, Bimala.

02:14:20.416 --> 02:14:23.977
l must go out to them now.
-- No! l won't let you!

02:14:24.086 --> 02:14:25.451
l must.

02:14:28.090 --> 02:14:29.853
Please don't stop me.

02:14:31.293 --> 02:14:32.851
My dear.

02:15:04.193 --> 02:15:07.094
-- You let him go?
-- We tried to stop him.

02:15:07.196 --> 02:15:08.891
He wouldn't listen to us!

02:15:10.232 --> 02:15:12.029
You witch!

02:15:12.735 --> 02:15:16.671
You sent him to his death!

02:15:17.306 --> 02:15:21.538
Have you no pity
in your heart of stone?
