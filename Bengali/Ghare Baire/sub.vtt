Screenplay, Music and Direction
by Satyajit Ray

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:54.391
<i>I have passed through fire.</i>

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:59.527
<i>What was impure in me</i>

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:04.094
<i>has been burned to ashes.</i>

00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:10.041
<i>What remains, I dedicate to him,</i>

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.871
<i>to the man who accepted aII my faiIings</i>
<i>in the depths of his stricken heart.</i>

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:21.686
<i>Now I know there is no one eIse Iike him.</i>

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:29.290
<i>It was 1 0 years ago when I first met him.</i>

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:36.061
<i>He was the son of a nobIe famiIy,</i>
<i>and I was his bride.</i>

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.208
<i>I heard that my husband</i>
<i>was of a gentIe disposition.</i>

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:50.109
<i>I considered myseIf fortunate.</i>
<i>Not every bride is so Iucky.</i>

00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:55.276
<i>When I joined the famiIy, my sister-in-Iaw</i>
<i>was aIready a widow, wearing white.</i>

00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:58.415
<i>Though it was never mentioned,</i>

00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:03.257
<i>I couId see that she had never enjoyed</i>
<i>the pIeasures of a happy maritaI Iife.</i>

00:04:19.078 --> 00:04:22.878
<i>Our rooms were in the inner</i>
<i>apartments of the paIace.</i>

00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:28.184
<i>A passage with stained-gIass windows</i>
<i>Ied to the outer apartments.</i>

00:04:28.688 --> 00:04:32.283
<i>The door of this passage</i>
<i>aIways remained cIosed to us.</i>

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.159
<i>I didn't mind the confinement,</i>

00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:39.489
<i>because I was raised</i>
<i>to foIIow traditionaI vaIues.</i>

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.057
<i>But my husband had modern views.</i>

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:48.333
<i>He was the first in his famiIy</i>
<i>to receive a Western education.</i>

00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:54.342
<i>He appointed Miss GiIby</i>
<i>to make a</i> memsahib <i>out of me.</i>

00:07:33.873 --> 00:07:36.273
Why did you have to come here?

00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:48.013
<i>Soon even the cIothes I wore</i>
<i>began to refIect Miss GiIby's infIuence.</i>

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:07.127
English clothes, English songs.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.832
Soon we won't even seem related.

00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:11.341
-- You still haven't told me how l look.
-- Very nice.

00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:14.769
Pretty as a picture.

00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:19.016
You're a lucky one.

00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:21.951
You should grab
your good fortune with both hands.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.868
Few brides have known
happiness in this family.

00:08:30.707 --> 00:08:34.165
Some barely knew their husbands' faces,
let alone the face of happiness.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.942
l used to wait up for him all night,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.017
hoping he'd come to me.

00:08:43.386 --> 00:08:48.824
For two whole days before he died,
l stayed by his bedside.

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:55.493
He was almost unconscious,
dazed with fever.

00:08:56.032 --> 00:08:58.262
He was burning hot.

00:08:58.668 --> 00:09:02.900
Suddenly, he opened his eyes and said,

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:06.567
''Who are you?''

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:14.374
He didn't even recognize his own wife.

00:09:18.054 --> 00:09:22.218
l wonder if you realize
how lucky you are.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:24.593
Why wouldn't l?

00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:27.858
Don't l know my own --

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:32.233
Look who's here.
We were just talking about you.

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:33.859
Really?

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:38.840
l thought only little girls
played with dolls.

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:41.433
Now l see even grown men do.

00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:44.480
-- What do you mean?
-- She's dolling herself up for you.

00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:47.744
Can't you see?
-- l see.

00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.411
She's going to make
your dreams come true.

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:55.124
Well, men must have
their little fantasies.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.650
lsn't that true, sister--in--law?

00:09:59.396 --> 00:10:01.125
Enjoy them.

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:07.367
l'll look on from the wings.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.132
From the wings? Why?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.003
What's the harm in staying here?

00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:14.903
lt's better that way.

00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:18.671
ln my day, we used attar.

00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:25.349
These foreign perfumes
make me feel sick.

00:10:26.923 --> 00:10:28.515
l'll be going now.

00:10:45.742 --> 00:10:47.437
Are these clothes all new?

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:49.341
The tailor brought them today.

00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:51.471
They're all my own design.

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:54.741
l can see that.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:58.581
You dress up so beautifully for me.

00:10:59.823 --> 00:11:02.656
ls it right that l should be
the only man to admire you?

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.922
You think l would dress up
for any other man?

00:11:06.963 --> 00:11:08.828
Why any other man?

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:12.726
l'm just thinking of the ones
l've sung your praises to.

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:15.361
You think they're dying
to catch a glimpse of me?

00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:20.574
-- You know something?
-- What?

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.576
ln the past, confining women
to the house wasn't a Hindu custom.

00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:30.244
Sita, Sabitri, Draupadi...

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.785
None of them were confined.

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:36.017
So what?
Your Bimala is happy here.

00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:43.463
Did you know that women used
to choose their own husbands?

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.930
Have you heard of that?

00:11:49.172 --> 00:11:50.161
Why are you laughing?

00:11:50.607 --> 00:11:54.873
lf l'd had a choice,
l might not have chosen you.

00:11:54.978 --> 00:11:56.206
l know.

00:11:56.746 --> 00:11:58.873
But you didn't have a choice.

00:11:58.982 --> 00:12:00.574
How sad.

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:03.619
l'm envious...

00:12:04.187 --> 00:12:06.018
of Draupadi...

00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:08.022
and her five husbands.

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:15.023
All your life, you've only
set eyes on one man.

00:12:15.632 --> 00:12:19.033
How can you know
what kind of man he is

00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:21.501
if you can't compare him with others?

00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:25.506
You aren't trying to bring back
the classical age, are you?

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:26.666
What for?

00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.975
Still, l see no logic in confining women.

00:12:32.215 --> 00:12:35.241
l think the Muslims introduced the custom.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.348
Hindus never cared about it.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.218
Do you think people will reject
this custom just because you say so?

00:12:44.828 --> 00:12:47.592
lt's not the people
l'm thinking of, Bimala.

00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:51.790
You know l'm not like other people.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:57.199
l don't think tradition
should be followed blindly.

00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:14.952
l would be really proud

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.656
if l could persuade you
to meet my friends.

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:22.088
You mean him?

00:13:27.504 --> 00:13:30.132
Sandip is a genius.

00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:35.433
l have no intention of meeting someone
who's constantly asking you for money

00:13:35.545 --> 00:13:38.105
on one pretext or another.

00:13:39.716 --> 00:13:41.980
Sandip is working
for the good of our nation.

00:13:42.652 --> 00:13:44.950
He's gifted, but has no money.

00:13:46.423 --> 00:13:50.018
lf my money contributes to his good deeds,
that's to my advantage.

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:53.061
For the good of our nation?
What does he do?

00:13:53.163 --> 00:13:54.357
The Swadeshi movement.

00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:57.865
Do you know about it?
-- Of course.

00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:00.902
They often talk about it these days.

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:04.635
Boycott foreign goods.

00:14:04.741 --> 00:14:06.868
Buy only lndian goods.

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:09.843
Don't buy foreign salt or sugar.
Buy our own.

00:14:11.347 --> 00:14:13.315
You know so much.

00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:16.378
l read the newspaper.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.020
-- Do you know why?
-- l do.

00:14:21.124 --> 00:14:22.284
Tell me.

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:25.487
Come. Sit down here and tell me.

00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:35.132
Yes, master.

00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:38.037
Tell me what's behind
the Swadeshi movement.

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:41.903
The governor--general
has split Bengal in two.

00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:44.809
Hindus and Muslims
used to live together in peace,

00:14:44.914 --> 00:14:47.883
but he's driven a wedge between them.

00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:56.119
You seem to forget
that your wife is educated.

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:59.326
l speak English.
Why wouldn't l know all this?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.163
Sandip is a leader
of the Swadeshi movement.

00:15:13.276 --> 00:15:16.768
lsn't their mantra, ''Hail Motherland''?

00:15:17.747 --> 00:15:18.873
Yes.

00:15:25.488 --> 00:15:29.447
This mantra has set
the whole nation on fire.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.286
Except for one person.

00:15:32.395 --> 00:15:34.955
lt hasn't set him on fire.

00:15:41.437 --> 00:15:44.463
lt takes a lot to set me on fire, Bimala.

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:47.533
Although...

00:15:49.178 --> 00:15:52.238
l certainly don't approve
of Lord Curzon's decision.

00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:56.612
Turning Hindus and Muslims
against each other...

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:59.654
l think it's criminal.

00:15:59.756 --> 00:16:02.281
Don't the Swadeshi burn foreign clothes?

00:16:02.392 --> 00:16:05.020
Yes, they do.

00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:07.621
lf they got hold of your sari,
they'd burn it.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.823
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:12.731
Do you know where
this thread comes from?

00:16:12.835 --> 00:16:14.097
Where?

00:16:15.438 --> 00:16:17.872
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:16:17.974 --> 00:16:21.102
Most of the articles
on your dressing table are imported.

00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:24.140
This brush is an import,

00:16:24.247 --> 00:16:27.546
the mirror, the comb.

00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:31.017
Your hairpins are imported.

00:16:31.955 --> 00:16:35.186
These perfumes are French.

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:39.959
Even these bottles
are imported cut glass.

00:16:40.997 --> 00:16:42.794
The table's foreign too.

00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:50.100
Most of the furniture in here
comes from Lazarus.

00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:53.141
lt's a foreign company.

00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:58.046
Really?

00:16:58.414 --> 00:17:00.473
We never even gave it a thought.

00:17:01.317 --> 00:17:03.376
What do you think we should do?

00:17:04.954 --> 00:17:07.081
Why not ask Sandip?

00:17:07.657 --> 00:17:08.851
He's coming here.

00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:11.253
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.556
-- When?
-- Shortly.

00:17:14.263 --> 00:17:15.890
He'll be my guest.

00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:17.990
He's holding a meeting
in our courtyard.

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:26.636
l think you'll enjoy meeting him.

00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:29.945
Why?

00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:35.144
Something about him appeals to women.

00:17:38.955 --> 00:17:41.583
He's had quite a few affairs.

00:17:42.425 --> 00:17:45.519
And not all the women
believed in Swadeshi.

00:17:46.062 --> 00:17:47.825
But he's not married, is he?

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:52.600
He says he has no time for it.

00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:57.204
Married life doesn't suit him.

00:17:58.074 --> 00:18:00.440
He has a restless nature,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.336
unlike me.

00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:05.711
Why would l enjoy
meeting your opposite?

00:18:07.884 --> 00:18:10.045
You may not enjoy it...

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.578
but you may find it instructive.

00:18:14.057 --> 00:18:15.684
l'm happy in my confinement.

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:18.693
l have no wish to be like Sita or Sabitri.

00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:24.459
<i>I was unprepared for what</i>
<i>foIIowed in the next few days.</i>

00:19:08.077 --> 00:19:11.740
<i>I was shocked by Miss GiIby's story.</i>

00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:15.916
<i>It was a Sunday,</i>
<i>so she had gone to church.</i>

00:19:16.018 --> 00:19:17.315
<i>On her way back,</i>

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.687
<i>a IocaI schooIboy hit her</i>
<i>on the head with a stone.</i>

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:25.283
<i>It seemed to be</i>
<i>the infIuence of the Swadeshi.</i>

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:29.330
<i>The peopIe began to feeI</i>
<i>so much hatred towards the British</i>

00:19:29.432 --> 00:19:34.460
<i>that Iife became dangerous even</i>
<i>for innocent peopIe Iike Miss GiIby.</i>

00:19:34.837 --> 00:19:39.035
<i>I was toId I couId no Ionger</i>
<i>become a</i> memsahib.

00:19:44.313 --> 00:19:46.372
<i>Miss GiIby Ieft.</i>

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.620
<i>A few days Iater,</i>
<i>the Swadeshi arrived.</i>

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:55.190
Hail Motherland!

00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.282
Hail Motherland!

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.584
Over there.

00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:02.163
Do you see him?
-- Where?

00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:03.857
Those boys are carrying him
on their shoulders.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.832
Hail Motherland!

00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:34.994
Friends...

00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:41.929
you all know why
we're assembled here tonight.

00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:45.133
For the past few days,

00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:49.901
Bengal has been facing
a serious crisis.

00:20:50.313 --> 00:20:55.512
Lord Curzon, the governor of lndia,
with one strike of his diplomatic sword,

00:20:55.818 --> 00:20:58.946
has severed our golden Bengal in two.

00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:01.819
ln East and West Bengal,

00:21:01.924 --> 00:21:04.188
our two religious groups

00:21:04.293 --> 00:21:12.598
have been united by a spirit
of solidarity, friendship and fraternity,

00:21:12.702 --> 00:21:20.131
and this solidarity has become a source
of grave concern for our rulers.

00:21:20.543 --> 00:21:24.843
The partition has cut
at the very roots of this solidarity.

00:21:25.214 --> 00:21:30.049
Now we all understand
what the policy of our rulers is:

00:21:30.152 --> 00:21:32.143
''Divide and rule.''

00:21:32.255 --> 00:21:35.884
They wish to create a rift between
our two religious communities

00:21:35.992 --> 00:21:39.655
and thereby strengthen
their own position.

00:21:39.762 --> 00:21:42.060
The power of our English rulers

00:21:42.164 --> 00:21:44.155
is matched only by their arrogance.

00:21:44.267 --> 00:21:50.968
The political leaders of Bengal
have risen as one against the partition,

00:21:51.073 --> 00:21:53.633
but our rulers have paid no heed to them.

00:21:54.143 --> 00:21:57.510
We lacked the means to prevent
our rulers from fulfilling their plans,

00:21:57.613 --> 00:22:03.279
but they failed to realize that
we can fight politics with politics.

00:22:03.386 --> 00:22:08.688
The strategy we have adopted
will not only confound our rulers,

00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:11.089
but it will also ultimately
benefit our nation

00:22:11.193 --> 00:22:15.220
and bring prosperity
and independence to our people.

00:22:15.331 --> 00:22:18.027
This is how Swadeshi works.

00:22:18.801 --> 00:22:21.429
l call upon all of you,

00:22:21.537 --> 00:22:23.528
men and women,

00:22:23.639 --> 00:22:25.470
rich and poor,

00:22:25.574 --> 00:22:27.667
rulers and subjects,

00:22:27.777 --> 00:22:32.441
to take a solemn vow

00:22:32.548 --> 00:22:36.609
to reject and boycott all foreign goods
from this moment on

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:40.621
and accept only lndian goods.

00:22:41.424 --> 00:22:46.555
Until now our rulers
have blocked all our attempts

00:22:46.662 --> 00:22:48.653
to develop our own resources.

00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:50.629
We have been forced
to buy their foreign cloth,

00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:54.965
their foreign salt
and their foreign sugar.

00:22:55.071 --> 00:22:57.437
Have you ever considered

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.839
how many everyday items
are being made here?

00:23:01.544 --> 00:23:05.742
l don't know if you've seen
the big foreign stores in Calcutta.

00:23:05.848 --> 00:23:06.974
l have.

00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:12.453
They enjoy staggering prosperity
and a profusion of goods.

00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:14.785
Don't we have the right to ask

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.293
why our wealth should fill
the coffers of our foreign rulers?

00:23:19.395 --> 00:23:21.727
Who gave them the right
to exploit us like this?

00:23:22.164 --> 00:23:24.826
ls this not at the root
of our nation's poverty?

00:23:24.934 --> 00:23:28.335
ls it not our duty to put
an end to this extortion?

00:23:28.437 --> 00:23:32.339
Has not the time come
to abolish this shame?

00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:35.774
lf we remain indifferent to these crimes,
if we do nothing,

00:23:35.878 --> 00:23:39.780
if these foreigners continue
to steal away all our nation's wealth,

00:23:39.882 --> 00:23:42.908
what kind of future
can we expect for our country?

00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:44.987
So l say to you, my brothers,

00:23:45.087 --> 00:23:49.217
the time has come to rise up against
the arrogance of the English government.

00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:51.190
We must not hesitate any longer.

00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:55.195
Let us all take the Swadeshi oath.

00:23:55.297 --> 00:23:59.666
And the great cry from the heart
that will launch us on this task,

00:23:59.769 --> 00:24:04.206
the sacred mantra that
will rock the throne of our rulers,

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:07.537
let us all chant that mantra,

00:24:07.643 --> 00:24:10.134
and, braving all peril,

00:24:10.246 --> 00:24:14.649
dedicate ourselves
to the service of the Motherland.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.117
Hail Motherland!
-- Hail Motherland!

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.010
Still singing English songs after
that impassioned nationalistic speech?

00:24:49.453 --> 00:24:50.681
What should l sing, then?

00:24:53.123 --> 00:24:57.856
Kirtan, Shyama Sangeet,
Nidhu Babu's tappa.

00:25:04.835 --> 00:25:10.432
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:16.001
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

00:25:16.113 --> 00:25:21.710
<i>Radiant as the moon,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:28.382
l must say, he is a good speaker.

00:25:28.492 --> 00:25:30.426
He knows how to turn a phrase.

00:25:30.527 --> 00:25:33.087
He was good at debate in college.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:40.167
<i>Her smiIe sends rippIes of deIight</i>

00:25:40.637 --> 00:25:43.663
All those boys wearing saffron
were a pretty sight.

00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:53.846
<i>That make the Iove god swoon</i>

00:25:58.421 --> 00:26:00.150
How long is he staying?

00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:03.523
He's going to Rangpur tomorrow.

00:26:05.795 --> 00:26:07.888
He has some business there.

00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:11.633
Do you want to meet him?

00:26:13.036 --> 00:26:16.130
l have nothing to say.
What's the point?

00:26:17.207 --> 00:26:19.641
You don't have to say anything.

00:26:19.743 --> 00:26:21.768
He'll do all the talking.

00:26:53.577 --> 00:26:55.977
What if he asks me about Swadeshi?

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.207
Then answer him.

00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:03.010
He certainly made sense.

00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:06.689
Tell him so.

00:27:07.624 --> 00:27:11.151
l'm sure he'll be shocked
if l wear one of my fancy dresses.

00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:16.726
What do you think l should wear?

00:27:32.048 --> 00:27:34.107
<i>On November 1 5, 1 907,</i>

00:27:34.184 --> 00:27:37.381
<i>the young mistress of the Choudhury house</i>
<i>defied aII convention</i>

00:27:37.487 --> 00:27:40.149
<i>and stepped into the passage</i>
<i>Ieading to the outer apartments.</i>

00:28:43.887 --> 00:28:44.854
Greetings.

00:28:51.027 --> 00:28:55.555
Your speech has inspired my wife
to take up the Swadeshi cause.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.492
-- You must be joking, Nikhil.
-- No, it's true.

00:29:02.005 --> 00:29:03.472
Come.

00:29:04.174 --> 00:29:05.698
Have a seat.

00:29:07.444 --> 00:29:09.071
Have a seat, Sandip.

00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:14.145
What's the matter with you?
Have a seat.

00:29:23.093 --> 00:29:28.759
At first, l couldn't believe my eyes.

00:29:30.133 --> 00:29:32.124
Now, l can't believe my ears.

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:35.194
My husband is exaggerating a bit.

00:29:36.172 --> 00:29:40.336
Even if only a fraction of what he said
is true, l'll be more than happy.

00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:43.938
No matter what l may
accomplish as a politician,

00:29:44.047 --> 00:29:47.380
you have already achieved
a social revolution.

00:29:48.418 --> 00:29:50.181
l know how important that is.

00:29:50.553 --> 00:29:51.884
l also realize that,

00:29:51.988 --> 00:29:54.548
although Nikhil's your husband,

00:29:55.058 --> 00:29:57.526
you're not his mere shadow.

00:29:57.627 --> 00:29:59.458
You have a mind of your own.

00:30:00.964 --> 00:30:05.060
Nikhil doesn't take my words
to heart, but you did.

00:30:05.168 --> 00:30:08.262
lf you keep on like that,
she'll be walking on air.

00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.999
lt's no use telling me that.

00:30:11.074 --> 00:30:15.534
As a politician, l'm utterly shameless
about seeking support for my cause.

00:30:16.847 --> 00:30:20.180
l have never succeeded
in persuading a woman,

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.446
but should that ever happen,
l'd be delighted.

00:30:24.154 --> 00:30:27.521
lt would be an honor
to have a woman in our ranks.

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:34.390
Women have a rare quality

00:30:35.065 --> 00:30:37.033
which we call intuition.

00:30:38.034 --> 00:30:40.400
l admire it greatly.

00:30:40.971 --> 00:30:44.498
Man's ability to reason
pales beside it.

00:30:45.775 --> 00:30:47.504
What do you say, Nikhil?

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:53.275
Why don't you tell him
what you thought of his speech?

00:30:53.383 --> 00:30:54.748
Oh, yes.

00:30:55.785 --> 00:30:58.276
That's what l was going to ask you.

00:30:59.322 --> 00:31:00.789
Tell me...

00:31:02.993 --> 00:31:06.360
did it sound like total drivel to you?

00:31:07.197 --> 00:31:09.222
Come on. Don't hesitate.

00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:11.967
l haven't had much time to think about it.

00:31:12.068 --> 00:31:14.536
That's precisely why l'm asking you.

00:31:14.638 --> 00:31:17.698
Why do you have to think?
Thinking is his task.

00:31:17.807 --> 00:31:21.402
Just tell me what comes from your heart.
Forget about rationality.

00:31:23.246 --> 00:31:26.181
l didn't understand much, but...

00:31:27.317 --> 00:31:32.254
l feel that if the English
have done wrong by splitting up Bengal,

00:31:32.355 --> 00:31:34.880
we should not let it pass.

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:40.155
lf Swadeshi can shake them up
a bit, then we should do it.

00:31:43.366 --> 00:31:47.769
Of course, if only a few people take up
the cause, it won't have any impact.

00:31:48.038 --> 00:31:52.907
But if the whole country joins in,
then we may succeed.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.273
Exactly!

00:31:55.946 --> 00:31:57.743
Exactly.

00:31:58.148 --> 00:32:00.275
That's exactly what we're trying to do.

00:32:00.383 --> 00:32:04.217
We want to awaken the nation
with our mantra, ''Hail Motherland!''

00:32:04.654 --> 00:32:08.420
Don't you think there's magic
in those two words?

00:32:08.525 --> 00:32:10.584
Have you ever said them?

00:32:13.797 --> 00:32:15.424
You should.

00:32:15.999 --> 00:32:18.559
You don't need to shout it.
Just whisper it.

00:32:18.668 --> 00:32:23.935
As a matter of fact,
when you all shouted that mantra,

00:32:24.307 --> 00:32:25.501
l felt a --

00:32:26.243 --> 00:32:27.801
A thrill?

00:32:29.546 --> 00:32:31.173
A shiver down my spine.

00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:33.010
That's how it should be.

00:32:33.817 --> 00:32:38.049
Did you know that your husband
doesn't believe in our mantra?

00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:42.655
lsn't that right, Nikhil?
-- l don't believe in propaganda.

00:32:43.293 --> 00:32:46.262
Propaganda?
What do you mean by that?

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:52.627
lf you're recruiting people who have never
cared about their country's problems before,

00:32:52.736 --> 00:32:54.294
how can you do it
without using propaganda?

00:32:54.804 --> 00:32:57.602
But the cause must come first, Nikhil.

00:32:57.707 --> 00:32:59.470
That's all that matters.

00:32:59.576 --> 00:33:01.942
Commitment to the cause
will come through inspiration,

00:33:02.045 --> 00:33:04.605
and the inspiration
will come from our mantra.

00:33:04.714 --> 00:33:07.649
Don't you remember the significance of
<i>''La MarseiIIaise"</i> in the French Revolution?

00:33:07.751 --> 00:33:14.623
What we need most today
is to rouse the people to action.

00:33:14.891 --> 00:33:17.724
Our poets are writing Swadeshi songs.

00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:19.886
Their sole purpose is to inspire the people.

00:33:19.996 --> 00:33:21.827
Have you ever heard any?

00:33:22.532 --> 00:33:27.469
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:30.004
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:33:30.106 --> 00:33:34.941
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:33:35.045 --> 00:33:36.706
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:33:36.813 --> 00:33:40.112
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

00:33:40.216 --> 00:33:42.707
<i>You take so much pride</i>

00:33:42.819 --> 00:33:45.287
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

00:33:45.388 --> 00:33:50.257
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.987
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:33:52.095 --> 00:33:55.531
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

00:33:55.632 --> 00:33:57.998
<i>You take so much pride</i>

00:33:58.101 --> 00:34:00.535
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

00:34:00.637 --> 00:34:03.367
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>

00:34:03.473 --> 00:34:05.907
<i>To keep us back forever?</i>

00:34:06.009 --> 00:34:08.375
<i>To hoId us down forever?</i>

00:34:08.478 --> 00:34:10.776
<i>To keep us back forever?</i>

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.371
<i>To hoId us down forever?</i>

00:34:13.483 --> 00:34:15.747
<i>You don't have that much strength</i>

00:34:15.852 --> 00:34:17.877
<i>You don't have that much strength</i>

00:34:17.987 --> 00:34:20.478
<i>Your strength wiII not withstand us</i>

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.323
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:34:25.428 --> 00:34:27.623
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:30.798
<i>You may try to govern us</i>

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.925
<i>But even the weak can summon strength</i>

00:34:33.403 --> 00:34:35.837
<i>You may try to govern us</i>

00:34:35.939 --> 00:34:38.271
<i>But even the weak can summon strength</i>

00:34:38.375 --> 00:34:40.741
<i>You may pride</i>
<i>yourseIf on your might</i>

00:34:40.844 --> 00:34:42.812
<i>You may pride</i>
<i>yourseIf on your might</i>

00:34:42.912 --> 00:34:45.745
<i>But God is stiII mightier</i>

00:34:45.849 --> 00:34:50.684
<i>Rob us of our strength</i>
<i>and you dig your own grave</i>

00:34:50.787 --> 00:34:55.747
<i>Rob us of our strength</i>
<i>and you dig your own grave</i>

00:34:55.859 --> 00:34:58.259
<i>Your boat wiII sureIy sink</i>

00:34:58.361 --> 00:35:00.488
<i>Your boat wiII sureIy sink</i>

00:35:00.597 --> 00:35:02.963
<i>Under the weight of your own guiIt</i>

00:35:03.066 --> 00:35:08.060
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:09.661
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:35:09.773 --> 00:35:13.072
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:15.644
<i>You take so much pride</i>

00:35:15.745 --> 00:35:18.145
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

00:35:18.248 --> 00:35:23.185
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

00:35:23.286 --> 00:35:26.187
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:30.692
l admit it's a beautiful song.

00:35:31.694 --> 00:35:33.958
Oh, my. What's all this?

00:35:34.063 --> 00:35:37.055
Swadeshi tea. Darjeeling.

00:35:37.167 --> 00:35:40.193
But there's a lot more here than just tea.

00:35:40.303 --> 00:35:44.296
You should have
some sweets too, not just tea.

00:35:44.407 --> 00:35:48.070
They're not only Swadeshi,
Bimala made them herself.

00:35:48.178 --> 00:35:49.941
-- Really?
-- Yes.

00:35:50.046 --> 00:35:52.310
Then l have to try one.

00:35:53.183 --> 00:35:56.584
l haven't gotten over
my weakness for sweets yet.

00:35:56.686 --> 00:35:59.211
Nor your weakness
for foreign cigarettes, l see.

00:35:59.322 --> 00:36:00.653
Out of the question.

00:36:00.757 --> 00:36:04.352
Are you familiar
with the Swadeshi brands?

00:36:04.894 --> 00:36:06.259
Unthinkable!

00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:09.024
-- Can't you give it up?
-- Smoking?

00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:12.527
Don't you have the willpower?

00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:21.477
Okay. Join our party,
and l'll stop smoking.

00:36:22.479 --> 00:36:24.071
Any sugar?

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.705
One teaspoon if it's foreign,
two if it's lndian.

00:36:35.492 --> 00:36:37.187
So tell me...

00:36:38.027 --> 00:36:40.086
what are your plans?

00:36:40.864 --> 00:36:42.331
They're not settled yet.

00:36:43.366 --> 00:36:47.302
Your neighbor, the land owner
Harish Kundu, has sent for me.

00:36:49.038 --> 00:36:52.405
They're having a bonfire
of foreign clothes at his place.

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:57.075
He wants me to help run the event,
so l must go there at once.

00:37:00.116 --> 00:37:01.310
Madam Bimala,

00:37:01.417 --> 00:37:05.751
did you know that the only stumbling
block left is your husband?

00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:08.187
He refuses to help the cause.

00:37:09.392 --> 00:37:13.192
You'll find many landed gentry
around here who support Swadeshi.

00:37:14.597 --> 00:37:17.589
What's the harm
in leaving my estate out of it?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.464
You see?
Did you see that?

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.970
Not even a shred of patriotism in him.

00:37:27.443 --> 00:37:29.411
Ah, well.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.474
So...

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.450
will you join our cause?

00:37:36.352 --> 00:37:37.614
Don't worry.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.086
You don't have to sign
a pledge or anything.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.584
You'll stay exactly as you are.

00:37:43.693 --> 00:37:45.786
l'll come to you if need be.

00:37:49.132 --> 00:37:50.622
Well?

00:37:50.733 --> 00:37:52.428
Yes or no?

00:37:53.303 --> 00:37:54.292
All right.

00:37:55.805 --> 00:37:57.602
l should be going now.

00:37:58.341 --> 00:38:01.105
-- Do you have to?
-- Yes, l have work to do.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.077
My boys are waiting downstairs.

00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:10.317
Madam Bimala, this is truly
a memorable day for me.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.685
l only have one request.

00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:15.019
Always trust your intuition.

00:38:15.124 --> 00:38:17.684
Don't let this gentleman influence you.

00:38:18.161 --> 00:38:20.891
Rest assured, Sandip.

00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:25.362
From now on,
my wife is a free agent.

00:38:25.468 --> 00:38:27.026
Wonderful!

00:38:27.437 --> 00:38:29.928
Good. l'll be going then.

00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:32.673
l'll see you out.

00:39:19.288 --> 00:39:21.153
<i>HaiI MotherIand!</i>

00:39:35.505 --> 00:39:37.666
Hail Motherland.

00:39:44.547 --> 00:39:48.449
-- You haven't told me yet.
-- What?

00:39:49.185 --> 00:39:51.949
What you thought of my friend.

00:39:52.055 --> 00:39:55.252
But l only met him once.

00:39:56.259 --> 00:40:02.425
l think the less one knows Sandip,
the better one likes him.

00:40:02.532 --> 00:40:05.467
You seem to have so little in common.

00:40:05.902 --> 00:40:09.201
l wonder how you managed
to become friends.

00:40:11.808 --> 00:40:14.140
That's not unusual, Bimala.

00:40:15.712 --> 00:40:19.910
Friendships aren't
worked out mathematically.

00:40:21.784 --> 00:40:25.242
We've been friends since college.

00:40:26.656 --> 00:40:29.056
lt's not like we have nothing in common.

00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:37.762
We both decided to reject
the irrational conventions of our society.

00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:43.030
He's always been more radical than l.

00:40:45.374 --> 00:40:48.468
When his parents arranged a bride for him,

00:40:48.578 --> 00:40:51.604
he was so annoyed
he severed all ties with them.

00:40:58.688 --> 00:41:03.455
Shortly after we got married,
he asked me to introduce him to you.

00:41:05.661 --> 00:41:08.824
He would remind me from time to time.

00:41:11.067 --> 00:41:13.001
Finally, he said,

00:41:13.336 --> 00:41:17.500
''l don't believe a word
you've said about your wife.''

00:41:23.412 --> 00:41:26.677
And do you know what he said today?
-- What?

00:41:33.089 --> 00:41:36.024
-- l'm not telling you.
-- Why not?

00:41:38.494 --> 00:41:41.327
What can he say about you
after such a brief meeting?

00:41:42.165 --> 00:41:45.225
l could say a lot more.

00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:48.536
But you never do.

00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:52.406
Do l have to?

00:41:53.142 --> 00:41:56.043
Don't you have your intuition?

00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:39.552
-- <i>Madam.</i>
-- What is it?

00:42:39.655 --> 00:42:42.089
<i>A Ietter from Mr. Mukherjee.</i>

00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:56.134
l hope the rule wasn't intended
to be broken for one day alone.

00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:59.538
Can l see you for a moment?

00:43:00.476 --> 00:43:03.468
-- Tell him l'm coming.
-- As you wish.

00:43:07.617 --> 00:43:12.247
''When Krishna's flute beckons so,
how can l not go?''

00:44:03.506 --> 00:44:05.201
Hail Motherland.

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:08.440
My husband's not here.

00:44:09.245 --> 00:44:12.339
l didn't ask for him.
l asked for you.

00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:15.146
Won't you sit down?

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.917
You've eluded me for years.

00:44:23.025 --> 00:44:26.153
You mustn't keep your distance now.

00:44:26.996 --> 00:44:30.159
Come and sit here,
right beside me.

00:44:55.725 --> 00:44:57.386
What's the matter?

00:44:59.762 --> 00:45:01.855
l can't believe it.

00:45:02.832 --> 00:45:08.031
Ever since you married, Nikhil promised
he would introduce me to you.

00:45:08.137 --> 00:45:10.605
l never believed him.

00:45:10.706 --> 00:45:13.641
Even now, l find it hard to believe.

00:45:14.844 --> 00:45:18.007
Until now, l've only heard about
your many accomplishments.

00:45:18.114 --> 00:45:20.207
You learned English from a <i>memsahib.</i>

00:45:20.316 --> 00:45:25.276
You love reading books, knitting, cooking.

00:45:25.388 --> 00:45:30.018
l even know what you like to cook,
to eat, your favorite flowers.

00:45:30.126 --> 00:45:32.219
l know everything.

00:45:33.796 --> 00:45:36.424
l also know something else.

00:45:37.533 --> 00:45:42.368
You resent the fact
that Nikhil lends me money.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.474
So you really aren't a stranger to me.

00:45:46.976 --> 00:45:50.207
But l never imagined...

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.840
l'd one day find myself
sitting by your side.

00:45:56.786 --> 00:46:00.187
-- Did you go to Rangpur?
-- Yes, l did.

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:03.122
-- How was the trip?
-- Great.

00:46:03.559 --> 00:46:06.960
That's why the first thing l wanted
to see this morning was you.

00:46:08.364 --> 00:46:10.525
Don't you have to leave again?

00:46:10.633 --> 00:46:12.999
-- Where to?
-- To Rangpur.

00:46:13.102 --> 00:46:15.900
lsn't that your base?

00:46:16.605 --> 00:46:20.598
That was the idea, but not anymore.

00:46:21.143 --> 00:46:22.735
lt's not?

00:46:25.247 --> 00:46:27.181
Let me be frank with you.

00:46:27.716 --> 00:46:29.911
l want to be near you when l work.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.789
Just like a bee working for the queen.

00:46:37.893 --> 00:46:39.451
You'll be the queen bee.

00:46:42.598 --> 00:46:44.463
Do you have any objection?

00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:49.669
But won't you find it inconvenient
working from here?

00:46:55.778 --> 00:46:57.405
That's true.

00:47:00.249 --> 00:47:05.949
l don't think Nikhil will approve of this.

00:47:10.025 --> 00:47:11.720
But the thing is...

00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:17.094
l am essentially...

00:47:20.503 --> 00:47:22.334
a stubborn man.

00:47:24.173 --> 00:47:27.609
l just can't accept Nikhil's attitude.

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:35.511
l want to promote
the Swadeshi cause right here...

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.745
and l need your help.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.391
But l really know nothing about your work.

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:47.224
l know that you
give speeches. ls that all?

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:52.431
That's one of the most important things.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.736
Persuasion can work wonders.

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.031
Wait.

00:48:00.343 --> 00:48:02.868
lf you really want to know about our work,

00:48:03.613 --> 00:48:05.080
then read this.

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.444
OUR STRUGGLE

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.144
lt contains everything you need to know.

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:15.788
l will definitely read it.

00:48:17.727 --> 00:48:20.161
May l tell you something now?

00:48:21.364 --> 00:48:24.492
One of the biggest markets
in this area is here, in Sukhsayar.

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:27.764
Did you know that?
-- So l've heard.

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:34.140
lt's the only market in the area
where foreign goods are still being sold.

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:38.245
Elsewhere, the landowners
have prohibited their sale,

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.940
but Nikhil hasn't.

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:43.645
l'm going to do my best to change that,

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.753
but, with your help,
my task will be much easier.

00:48:48.858 --> 00:48:52.385
l'm afraid you're overestimating
my capabilities.

00:48:52.495 --> 00:48:54.360
Not at all.

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:59.465
Nikhil may be my friend,
but he's your husband.

00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:02.538
You have much more influence
over him than l do.

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:06.405
My husband isn't easily swayed.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.302
l know...

00:49:09.045 --> 00:49:11.878
but l think he'll listen to you.

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:19.248
l know how much you mean to Nikhil.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:23.092
Will you try just once to persuade him?

00:49:25.695 --> 00:49:28.960
Nikhil's tenants wouldn't dare
to go against his will.

00:49:29.065 --> 00:49:32.296
He only has to tell them not to bring
any more foreign goods to the market.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.267
And if l fail to persuade him?

00:49:36.072 --> 00:49:38.768
l'll be happy if you just try.

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:42.136
lf you fail, l'll find another way.

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:45.037
Not without the queen bee's
knowledge, of course.

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:49.177
Can l depend on you?

00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:51.811
l'll try my best.

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:01.324
The more l see you,

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:04.057
the more l admire you.

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.478
l think l'll --

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:20.312
Okay, you may go now.

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:26.318
Oh, and one more thing.

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.519
This item of yours.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.536
This is the only foreign item
l will keep with me.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.744
Did you see Sandip today?

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.277
<i>Yes.</i>

00:50:54.984 --> 00:50:56.781
How is he doing?

00:50:58.254 --> 00:51:00.188
He's worried.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.780
Why?

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.758
You won't let him promote
the Swadeshi cause here.

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:09.597
Nonsense.
You heard me yourself.

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:14.062
He's free to fight for his cause
as long as he leaves my estate alone.

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.938
He says he's staying here.

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.800
Staying here?

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:23.268
That's what he says.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.241
He's going to stay and work here.

00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:30.676
That wouldn't be right.

00:51:31.921 --> 00:51:33.889
But all of Bengal has taken up
the Swadeshi cause.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.082
Why don't you?

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:41.496
That would mean banning
all foreign goods from the market.

00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:45.230
Harish Kundu can do that, but not me.

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:48.299
Surely the market belongs to you.
Why can't you?

00:51:49.305 --> 00:51:51.296
lt's not my market, Bimala.

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:55.073
The market belongs to the traders
who sell their goods there.

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:56.839
They're poor.

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:03.317
Foreign goods are cheaper
and of better quality than lndian goods.

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:09.415
The poor villagers can afford them.
How can l force them not to buy them?

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:16.559
Swadeshi is for those who can afford it,

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:18.497
not for the poor.

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:25.202
What are you thinking?

00:52:26.075 --> 00:52:27.975
Can we follow Swadeshi...

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.209
without making the poor suffer?

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.010
ls it possible?

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:38.120
lf it were possible,
l'd definitely support Swadeshi.

00:52:39.255 --> 00:52:41.689
You believe the very idea
of Swadeshi is wrong.

00:52:43.092 --> 00:52:45.754
Even if l do,
who would listen to me?

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:48.296
The entire country supports Swadeshi.

00:52:49.098 --> 00:52:51.589
You yourself believe Sandip is right.

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.931
Many others must feel the same way.

00:52:55.839 --> 00:53:02.677
But l believe that coercing the poor
can only harm our country.

00:53:08.551 --> 00:53:10.951
l can see you're not convinced.

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:14.683
l was looking at it differently.

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:18.386
l was thinking that
something has to be done.

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.520
Even if it means
hardship for the poor now,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.825
it will help them in the long run.

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:26.202
The Swadeshi care about this country.

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:34.073
l believe what they care about
is an abstract idea of this country,

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:36.771
this country as the Mother Goddess.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.377
The nation is our mother.

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:44.715
Worship our mother,
work for our mother, pray to our mother.

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:48.321
Everything you do is for our mother.

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:51.426
Heal our mother's pain.

00:53:52.161 --> 00:53:53.822
l can understand that.

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:57.462
And l can understand why
that idea appeals to women.

00:53:58.101 --> 00:54:00.934
l know how you feel, Bimala,

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:03.403
but l don't feel the same way.

00:54:27.463 --> 00:54:29.624
Those things you said tonight...

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:32.127
Were those your own thoughts?

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:34.396
Why are you asking me this?

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:39.599
l felt as if you were speaking for Sandip.

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:42.610
Sandip is your friend, not mine.

00:54:44.213 --> 00:54:49.412
l thought you two had teamed up
''in right earnest'' to fight for a higher cause.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.687
He's working on the public front,
and you on the domestic.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.348
What an idea!

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.761
Will you have daily meetings?

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:11.171
You insisted that l meet your friend,
so you can spare me the insinuations.

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:27.249
l just asked a simple question.

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:30.584
l wasn't insinuating anything.
-- Very well.

00:55:30.693 --> 00:55:33.719
lf it upsets you so much,
l won't go outside anymore.

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:36.565
You're mistaken, Bimala.

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.930
l'm not upset at all.

00:55:39.435 --> 00:55:42.598
After all, l know you both so well.

00:55:42.705 --> 00:55:47.165
Why shouldn't you go outside?
-- Because l don't want to.

00:55:48.277 --> 00:55:49.869
You're being unreasonable.

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:53.540
l've been out twice already.
l don't have to go out every day.

00:55:56.285 --> 00:55:58.014
Very well.

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:13.298
l won't restrict you
from going where you please.

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:19.371
As l told you,
you are completely free.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:24.947
But l must tell you one thing.

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:30.843
lf you tell me you want to give up
wearing foreign clothes,

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:36.448
or do without your foreign
perfumes, shoes and soap,

00:56:36.759 --> 00:56:38.989
l won't mind at all.

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.695
But clamping down on poor traders

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:46.494
by banning foreign goods in the market

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:50.497
means going against
my own beliefs and principles.

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.372
l could never do that, Bimala.

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:03.752
Swadeshi is something l can't take lightly.

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:14.520
<i>The weak say, ''Whatever fate</i>
<i>has given to me is mine. "</i>

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:18.964
<i>And the impotent agree with them.</i>

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:21.832
<i>''OnIy what I can snatch away</i>
<i>by force is mine. "</i>

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.463
<i>That is what experience has taught us.</i>

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:27.737
<i>My country is not mine</i>
<i>simpIy because I was born here.</i>

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:31.712
<i>It becomes mine</i>
<i>onIy when I am abIe to win it by force.</i>

00:57:31.814 --> 00:57:34.146
<i>OnIy then can the nation be mine.</i>

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:46.654
This funeral pyre celebrates the cremation
of foreign trade in your village.

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.727
These ashes are sacred.

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:51.828
Hail Motherland!

00:58:07.316 --> 00:58:12.618
AN URGENT MATTER
REGARDlNG OUR CAUSE

00:58:23.866 --> 00:58:27.768
-- Please give this to Mrs. Choudhury.
-- Very well.

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:11.604
Madam isn't feeling well, sir.

00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:18.450
l see.

00:59:29.498 --> 00:59:32.626
-- You know the headmaster, don't you?
-- Yes, of course.

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:35.966
Good morning.
l hope you are doing well.

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:39.937
Not as long as you're around.

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:44.876
How come?

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:48.717
His students have all disappeared
since you arrived.

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:55.782
But you must admit that working
for one's country helps build character.

00:59:58.494 --> 01:00:02.897
One of my students was influenced
by the Swadeshi movement.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:06.901
He threw a stone at Mrs. Choudhury's
governess, Miss Gilby.

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:10.267
Would you consider that
an example of character building?

01:00:10.806 --> 01:00:14.071
But that happened before l came.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.908
You can't blame me for that.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.380
After all, you must admit
that a few such incidents

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:24.886
are inevitable in times
of great social upheaval.

01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:28.082
You even roped in my best student.

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:30.283
Who? Amulya?

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.325
He'd have won a scholarship
if he'd taken his exam.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:37.160
You stole that opportunity from him.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.863
Amulya? l didn't rope him in.
He joined of his own accord.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:46.034
What about the other rowdy dissolutes
who have joined your team?

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:49.236
They're the worst troublemakers in the village.

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.870
They're not troublemakers anymore, sir.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.882
They're fighting for the cause.
They're working hard.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:59.219
With two exceptions,
everyone here is working for the cause.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.983
One of them is you.

01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:05.793
The other one is your former
student Nikhilesh Choudhury.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:09.126
l regret that
l couldn't persuade him to join.

01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:11.995
Like you, he turns a deaf ear
to the Swadeshi cause.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.036
No, he isn't against Swadeshi ideals.

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:19.267
He's against your
destructive brand of Swadeshi.

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:22.139
He practiced Swadeshi long before you,

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:25.213
and he never relied
on any battle cries or mantras.

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:28.078
-- l know that.
-- You know nothing!

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.277
Do you know about his Swadeshi bank?

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:33.844
Or his Swadeshi sugar factory,
his soap factory?

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:39.189
Do you know he set up his own looms
for weaving Swadeshi cloth?

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:44.498
Where were you
and your ''Hail Motherland'' then?

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:48.561
Do you know how much
he spent for Swadeshi?

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.696
-- Please, headmaster --
-- You stay out of this!

01:01:50.806 --> 01:01:55.209
These things must be said.
-- But that's what l keep telling him.

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:58.040
lf both of us have the same goals,
then why doesn't he join us?

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:01.950
You don't have the same goals.
There are many differences.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:06.421
Your goal is power and leadership.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.684
You don't care about the people!

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:11.590
Nikhil never thought about himself.

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:16.428
People are applauding you
and singing your praises.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.632
Nikhil was ridiculed.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:24.366
He had no head for business,
so his brand of Swadeshi didn't last.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.806
But his way was the right way.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.836
Yours is wrong.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.572
lt's more than wrong.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.739
lt's dangerous.

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:37.047
Give those to me.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.054
l'll drop by this evening.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.162
My goodness.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.701
Please, Nikhil, l implore you.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:56.602
Keep that headmaster away from me.

01:02:56.706 --> 01:03:00.665
l came here to give speeches,
not listen to them.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.336
Are you planning to stay here and work?

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:16.082
l'm going to speak
at your market this afternoon.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:19.892
That's where our greatest
challenge lies, Nikhil.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:26.427
Not where the landowner
is already in favor of Swadeshi,

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:29.902
but where he isn't.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.031
But remember, Sandip,

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.440
most of my tenants are poor Muslims.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.108
l don't want them harassed.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:48.284
lf l see that happening,
l will be forced to intervene.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.753
lf they prove to be obstacles
to our revolution,

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.429
l'll have to take the necessary measures.

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:57.799
Many Muslims have accepted Swadeshi.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.900
They were forced to do so.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.273
lt will happen here too.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:09.644
l've said what l had to say.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.746
What you do now is up to you.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:23.187
As you all know,

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.625
our English rulers

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:29.665
have divided Bengal in two.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:37.632
This amounts to erecting a wall
between Hindus and Muslims.

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:43.469
They have not given us
the right to break this wall,

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.983
but, to foil the government,
we have chosen a different path.

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:50.712
One important way to fight the partition

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:56.053
is to stop selling foreign goods
in our markets.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.460
Salt, sugar, cloth and soap
are all everyday items

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:05.865
which are only available
as foreign products at your market.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.004
By selling their foreign goods here,

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:14.236
the British are making
a lot of money in our country,

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:19.179
while we keep growing poorer.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.876
This is wrong.
This must stop.

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:25.443
We've tolerated this up to now,
but no more.

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:32.154
l know that lndian substitutes
for foreign goods are not always available,

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:36.995
so you've had to trade with foreign goods
because that's all you had.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.467
But if we can all make sacrifices

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.472
and produce our own goods,

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:48.305
then we will overcome these difficulties.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:51.911
Brothers, we are depending on you.

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:54.449
lf you come forward and join us,

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:57.418
together we will stop
the partitioning of Bengal

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.988
and regain our pride.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.983
And now, do you see
this circle here before me?

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:10.362
Throw all your foreign goods
into the circle of flags.

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:14.294
lndian substitutes will be made.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:18.198
Many manufacturers
have come forward to help us.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.805
Have no fear of losing your livelihood.

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:26.108
Today's loss will not be lost forever.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:30.983
Now l ask you to throw all
of your foreign goods into the circle.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:36.348
The land that gave birth to you,
the land that you love...

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.950
Now is the time to help her.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:43.126
Foreign cloth, foreign thread,

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:46.464
foreign sugar, foreign salt,

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.834
foreign scissors and knives,

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:52.430
foreign matches,
and everything else foreign...

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:55.067
Throw them in that circle.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.807
We beseech you.
Don't just sit there.

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:01.247
Help the Swadeshi cause.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:05.310
We want to hear it from the maharaja!
Let him come here.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.187
We won't listen to you!

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:11.617
Your maharaja is my friend.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:14.128
l'm his guest.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.495
lsn't that proof enough
that l have his support?

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.592
We're traders.
lf we have nothing to sell, we'll starve!

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:23.798
We've tried selling lndian goods.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:25.204
Nobody buys them.

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:28.106
You're a gentleman.
You have money.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.942
lt's easy for you to say,
''Don't sell foreign goods.''

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.881
We're poor!
How will we survive?

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:44.126
<i>It's cIear that persuasion</i>
<i>won't work on NikhiI's estate.</i>

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.821
<i>We'II have to use other means.</i>

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:51.961
<i>Any compromise on foreign goods</i>
<i>wouId crippIe our movement.</i>

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:57.097
<i>HaiI MotherIand!</i>

01:08:36.012 --> 01:08:37.479
This is Mr. Kulada.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.275
Greetings.

01:08:39.382 --> 01:08:40.474
Please follow me.

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:49.091
Were those stolen from the villagers?

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:57.399
Have a seat.

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:02.763
You may enjoy your bonfire, but the villagers
will file a complaint against you.

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:08.477
We'll set fire to their crops if they do.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:11.338
Can't we try picketing?

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.875
We can make them understand.

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:17.376
lt's worked in other places.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.082
l know what works and what doesn't.

01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:22.385
Picketing won't work in Sukhsayar.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.158
Please sit, Mr. Kulada.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:35.197
A foreign brand, l see.

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:38.172
Yes, it's the only exception
l make to Swadeshi.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.936
-- May l have one?
-- Be my guest.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:45.842
These people can't be persuaded, Amulya.

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:48.113
They've been pampered too much.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:55.590
Listen, l've been the manager of this estate
since the maharaja's father was alive.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.784
The father was a tough one.

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:02.126
The trouble is the son.

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:04.257
lf only he'd been firm with them,

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:08.098
he could have brought
these villagers to their knees.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.037
lt would have been smooth sailing for you.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:16.603
Anyway, tell me how you can help us.

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:21.940
lf you can't stop the influx
of foreign goods,

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:26.188
you can't stop the trade of foreign goods.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:31.317
Those boats bring the goods in.

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:36.628
-- You'll have to deal with the boatmen first.
-- Can you do that for me?

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:43.568
The problem is that the boatmen's
leader is very stubborn.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.232
Who is he?
What's his name?

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:51.040
Mirjan.
He's a hard nut to crack.

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:56.212
-- Can he be persuaded?
-- Where there's a will, there's a way.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.820
A boat which sails
is also a boat which sinks.

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:10.389
But it's going to take
more than words to do this job.

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:13.930
lt will take...
-- Money?

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:16.971
We have to stop tongues from wagging,

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:20.634
pay compensation,
bribe the police.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.506
That all takes money.

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:28.306
lt's not like we don't have any money,

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:31.876
and more can be raised if necessary.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:35.082
Then you can rely on me.

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:39.919
l'll do the dirty work,

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:43.556
but if something goes wrong,

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.463
you're on your own.

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.796
You don't need to worry about that.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.637
Even so, if l get into any sort of trouble,

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:56.439
l have no intention of taking all the blame.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:07.216
l'm keeping this letter you wrote me.

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:12.485
<i>I didn't go.</i>

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:14.529
<i>He asked for me.</i>

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:19.796
<i>I gave an excuse and stayed inside,</i>
<i>but what good did it do?</i>

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:23.861
<i>I was thinking of him aII day yesterday.</i>

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:26.703
<i>Why shouId this happen to a woman</i>

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:33.305
<i>who has never thought about any man</i>
<i>other than her own husband?</i>

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.548
Madam, how do you want
the fish prepared?

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.518
You never told me.

01:12:38.889 --> 01:12:41.084
Make a curry with ground mustard seed.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.092
<i>Madam?</i>

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:54.662
Yes, Nanku?

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.966
<i>There's a Ietter for you.</i>

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:04.970
OUR STRUGGLE

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:08.150
Are you feeling any better?

01:13:10.087 --> 01:13:10.951
Yes.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:15.248
This boy from our group
was very eager to meet you.

01:13:18.929 --> 01:13:21.864
You met me once before when l was little.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.660
l came with my mother.

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:26.292
-- What's your mother's name?
-- Soudamini Devi.

01:13:28.105 --> 01:13:32.041
-- Are you Nibaron Ghosal's son?
-- Yes. My name is Amulya.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.777
-- How old are you?
-- Seventeen.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.348
l was about to take
my final exam, but l didn't.

01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:42.043
Because of Swadeshi?

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:44.052
Amulya is very hardworking.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:46.989
He remembers the entire <i>Bhagavadgita.</i>

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:49.621
Really?

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:51.994
Here it is.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:54.996
-- Do you always carry it with you?
-- Always.

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:58.625
The <i>Bhagavadgita</i> gives one courage
to overcome one's fears.

01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:00.862
Even to die for one's country.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.008
Aren't you afraid to die?

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:08.976
''For the soul, there is neither birth
nor death at any time.

01:14:09.079 --> 01:14:12.344
He has not come into being, does not come
into being, and will not come into being.

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:15.543
He is unborn, eternal,
ever--existing and primeval.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:18.678
He is not slain when the body is slain.''

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.120
Even when a man dies,
his soul lives on.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.692
Okay, Amulya.
You may go now.

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:28.196
Mr. Sandip said you believe in Swadeshi.

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:30.664
l wanted to pay my respects.

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:32.064
l'll take my leave, sister.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:35.527
l'll come again.
-- Please do.

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:36.936
Hail Motherland.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:40.538
-- Hail Motherland.
-- Good--bye.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.683
What are you thinking?

01:14:54.558 --> 01:14:58.358
ls there any danger to your life
in the work you do?

01:15:01.298 --> 01:15:02.788
Well...

01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:08.867
Since we're fighting against
the powerful British government,

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.365
of course there is.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:22.208
But my boys are brave.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.616
My courage doesn't begin to match theirs.

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:28.316
That's a strange confession from a leader.

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:33.961
Sometimes the truth comes out.

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:40.936
Now will you tell me the truth?

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:43.767
What truth?

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:47.372
After so many years,

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:50.207
why did you suddenly decide
to come out of your confinement?

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:53.144
Don't you know why?

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:55.415
How would l know?

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:57.486
You should know.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:02.557
You should, but you're a man.

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:04.650
You don't have a woman's intuition.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:07.824
Will you tell me?

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:26.008
Why?

01:16:35.225 --> 01:16:38.683
l'd never been face--to--face
with a leader before.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:44.732
l fear the leader may have let you down.

01:16:52.809 --> 01:16:55.471
Not so far.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:20.927
You play the piano too?

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:24.496
l was taking lessons.

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:26.206
Piano...

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:28.835
singing.

01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:31.509
English songs?

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:05.644
You didn't come yesterday.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:11.186
l had a feeling you weren't really ill.

01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:14.685
l racked my brain all day trying to guess...

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:22.324
what l had done or said to annoy you.

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:28.293
You still haven't told me
why you called.

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.202
l just wanted to see you.

01:18:32.776 --> 01:18:34.505
ls that the only reason?

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.673
l didn't see you yesterday,

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:42.377
and it turned out
to be a dismal day for me.

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:45.251
My pride as a leader...

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.814
was badly shaken.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:50.885
The people won't listen to you?

01:18:51.361 --> 01:18:54.694
Sometimes words are not enough.

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:58.791
-- What do you do then?
-- l try other ways.

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:00.936
May l know what ways?

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:04.996
Because my husband's
not going to help you.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:10.606
Nikhil said so?

01:19:19.389 --> 01:19:21.653
Do you know what l feel
like doing sometimes?

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:24.392
To hell with Swadeshi.

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:27.794
l'll spend my life
chatting with the queen bee.

01:19:29.699 --> 01:19:31.257
With me?

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:32.701
Chatting?

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:35.700
Would that bother you?

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:40.609
Why are you laughing?

01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:43.873
That's so absurd.

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:48.041
You're not the type to spend
even an hour chatting.

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:52.654
You're right.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.689
The truth is...

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.655
l need Swadeshi...

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.130
just as much as l need you.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:07.894
l don't want you to stop
fighting for the country.

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:13.372
My husband and l don't see
eye to eye on that matter.

01:20:13.843 --> 01:20:18.405
He has many virtues,
and l admire him for that.

01:20:19.082 --> 01:20:25.214
But, for a man, he is much too placid.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:28.757
A person can't afford to be so placid
at a time like this.

01:20:32.295 --> 01:20:34.991
l agree with you entirely.

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:40.796
My husband says
you don't care about the poor,

01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:44.271
so you can't really do
any good for our country.

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:50.842
l don't believe you would hurt the poor.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:54.646
You'll try to persuade them.
That's all.

01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:03.058
But the problem is...

01:21:05.495 --> 01:21:07.929
persuasion doesn't always work.

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:13.458
You need something more.
-- What do you need?

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:20.236
-- Let's not talk about that.
-- l want to know.

01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:24.136
l don't want to talk
about mundane things with you.

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:25.646
Why?

01:21:28.084 --> 01:21:31.281
l want no note of discord
in our relationship.

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:34.815
But l'd be really happy to help.

01:21:36.526 --> 01:21:37.823
This is beyond you, queen bee.

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:41.123
Haven't you seen me going beyond?

01:21:42.265 --> 01:21:46.725
l know how far you can go.
Even so, l'd rather not talk about it.

01:21:46.836 --> 01:21:48.565
lt's a personal request.

01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:54.871
Then there's no reason for me to stay.

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:57.112
l'm leaving.

01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:01.115
Queen bee, please don't leave angry!

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:05.711
lf l can't help you with Swadeshi,
then l'm just wasting my time here.

01:22:05.822 --> 01:22:08.290
l just didn't want you to worry about me.

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:11.621
Must we only talk about politics?

01:22:11.728 --> 01:22:13.195
Only about my work?

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:17.254
Promise me you'll tell me
if you need money,

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:20.336
and you'll take it if l give it to you.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.494
l promise, queen bee.

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:24.902
l promise.

01:22:25.174 --> 01:22:26.641
Queen bee?

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:30.177
l'll come again this evening.
Please wait for me here.

01:22:30.647 --> 01:22:33.138
l hate having to send for you every time.

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:35.275
Let go of me.

01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:39.446
Promise me you'll come to me every day.

01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:43.221
l must see you at least once a day.

01:22:44.494 --> 01:22:46.826
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:49.462
Promise me.

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:51.260
All right.

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:57.165
Please let go of my hand.
l want to go.

01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:23.431
Khemi, clean the room later.

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:44.673
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

01:24:51.254 --> 01:24:53.313
Back so soon?

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.323
What are you staring at?

01:25:01.531 --> 01:25:03.624
What is there to stare at but you?

01:25:04.734 --> 01:25:06.929
l've never seen anything like it.

01:25:08.204 --> 01:25:10.138
Such tender concern for our guest.

01:25:10.573 --> 01:25:12.939
He'll never want to leave.

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:19.171
ln my day, we had to look
after our husbands too.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:25.678
lf only my brother--in--law
were a guest in his own house,

01:25:26.389 --> 01:25:28.220
he'd be warmly welcomed.

01:25:28.324 --> 01:25:31.293
l don't want any advice from you.

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:39.895
l was just a small girl
when l came here as a bride.

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:45.232
Your husband was
my playmate in those days.

01:25:47.143 --> 01:25:48.838
Where were you then?

01:25:48.945 --> 01:25:52.073
There's no need to repeat
what l already know.

01:25:57.086 --> 01:25:59.554
He was the only one
who understood my pain.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:01.213
He used to say,

01:26:01.924 --> 01:26:04.586
''We're still living in the Dark Ages.

01:26:05.261 --> 01:26:07.354
That's why you're suffering like this.

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:13.058
For you, having a husband
is just as painful as losing one.''

01:26:13.569 --> 01:26:18.632
''My wife will be a free woman,'' he'd say.

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:24.813
Well, now l see that free woman
before my very eyes.

01:26:29.085 --> 01:26:31.246
But don't forget,

01:26:32.255 --> 01:26:34.280
there's a God above us, dear sister.

01:26:34.824 --> 01:26:38.282
He can see you too.

01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:54.041
<i>I beIieved I had the strength to bear</i>

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:59.807
<i>whatever misfortune</i>
<i>fate had in store for me.</i>

01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:05.812
<i>I wouId caII up visions of suffering</i>
<i>and steeI myseIf against them.</i>

01:27:06.589 --> 01:27:08.557
<i>Visions of poverty,</i>

01:27:08.658 --> 01:27:12.492
<i>dishonor or death.</i>

01:27:13.195 --> 01:27:16.722
<i>I even imagined BimaIa's death.</i>

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.358
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>I couId never imagine happening.</i>

01:27:22.538 --> 01:27:26.497
<i>Now I keep asking myseIf</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:29.637
<i>Do I have the strength to bear this?</i>

01:27:30.013 --> 01:27:34.279
-- Hail Motherland!
-- Hail Motherland!

01:27:54.371 --> 01:27:58.899
-- What do you want?
-- We have some questions.

01:27:59.009 --> 01:28:00.169
What are they?

01:28:00.277 --> 01:28:03.508
Why don't you ban
foreign goods in our market?

01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:06.776
-- l have my reasons.
-- ls it because you would lose money?

01:28:09.152 --> 01:28:13.384
l wouldn't, but the poor would.

01:28:13.757 --> 01:28:15.486
But our nation will profit.

01:28:15.592 --> 01:28:19.585
We buy domestic salt, sugar and clothing.

01:28:19.696 --> 01:28:21.391
How can you say that?

01:28:22.199 --> 01:28:24.827
How can you compare
yourselves with the poor?

01:28:25.302 --> 01:28:27.236
You have money.

01:28:27.337 --> 01:28:30.329
You can afford
to spend more on lndian goods.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:34.343
The poor aren't standing in your way.

01:28:35.011 --> 01:28:36.376
Why are you standing in theirs?

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:39.749
You want to oppose an entire nation
that's taken the Swadeshi oath?

01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:40.646
Never.

01:28:41.685 --> 01:28:43.585
That's beyond my power.

01:28:44.287 --> 01:28:47.518
But how can you say
the entire nation has taken your oath?

01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:50.088
Look at the evidence.

01:28:50.193 --> 01:28:52.593
Aren't the traders part of this nation?

01:28:52.696 --> 01:28:55.961
So you won't ban foreign goods?

01:28:57.567 --> 01:28:58.966
No,

01:28:59.469 --> 01:29:02.302
because those goods don't belong to me.

01:29:02.405 --> 01:29:04.100
Hail Motherland!

01:29:25.996 --> 01:29:27.395
What are you looking for?

01:29:28.765 --> 01:29:30.494
<i>PassifIora.</i>

01:29:31.868 --> 01:29:33.802
Didn't you have a vial?

01:29:35.539 --> 01:29:37.473
Are you having trouble sleeping?

01:29:39.242 --> 01:29:42.678
One sleeps less as one grows older,

01:29:43.613 --> 01:29:45.877
but these last three nights --

01:29:45.982 --> 01:29:48.143
Here it is.

01:29:48.251 --> 01:29:49.479
l found it.

01:29:49.586 --> 01:29:51.315
Please, keep the vial.

01:30:01.898 --> 01:30:04.332
l don't like this, Nikhil.

01:30:05.702 --> 01:30:12.301
l have grave misgivings
about the way things are shaping up.

01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:17.011
Sandip is your friend and your guest.

01:30:17.681 --> 01:30:20.081
Everybody knows that.

01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:24.819
Soon they'll believe whatever he does
is done with your sanction.

01:30:25.655 --> 01:30:30.957
Don't you realize how terrible
the consequences could be for you?

01:30:33.063 --> 01:30:35.657
l'm already feeling those consequences, sir.

01:30:36.766 --> 01:30:38.734
They think l'm a British lackey,

01:30:39.569 --> 01:30:44.097
that l don't force Swadeshi on my tenants
for fear they would stop paying rent.

01:30:44.207 --> 01:30:48.200
That's the propaganda.
-- Don't let it worry you.

01:30:48.712 --> 01:30:53.740
Nothing can touch you as long as
you have a clear conscience.

01:30:54.818 --> 01:30:58.549
But the situation is deteriorating.

01:31:00.023 --> 01:31:05.655
Muslim preachers from Dhaka are
going around stirring up the peasants.

01:31:06.196 --> 01:31:07.823
Have you heard about it?

01:31:08.965 --> 01:31:10.865
l've read about it in the papers.

01:31:10.967 --> 01:31:13.800
What's to stop them from coming here?

01:31:14.738 --> 01:31:17.571
-- Nothing.
-- And then?

01:31:19.476 --> 01:31:21.341
But if anything does happen,

01:31:22.245 --> 01:31:26.579
can we place all the blame
on the preachers?

01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:29.544
We are also responsible.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.413
How can we just ignore that?

01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:37.153
Think about how we ourselves
have treated the poor Muslims.

01:31:38.295 --> 01:31:42.493
Have we even respected
their rights as human beings?

01:31:42.599 --> 01:31:46.194
That's true, but what
can be done about it now?

01:31:49.806 --> 01:31:51.034
l'll go there.

01:31:52.909 --> 01:31:55.139
l want to see for myself.

01:31:56.313 --> 01:31:59.009
Rumors can be misleading.

01:31:59.115 --> 01:32:02.778
Nikhil, can't you inform the magistrate?

01:32:03.453 --> 01:32:06.047
l don't think he'd mind a riot.

01:32:06.856 --> 01:32:09.154
lt's an easy way for him
to see the Swadeshi punished.

01:32:09.259 --> 01:32:11.727
There is one thing you can do.

01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:16.756
You can at least eradicate
the source of the trouble.

01:32:17.634 --> 01:32:20.068
Why let Sandip stay?

01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:30.377
l thought he'd leave of his own accord.

01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:34.749
But now --

01:32:35.452 --> 01:32:37.784
Leave? Why would he?

01:32:38.922 --> 01:32:42.119
With all the comfort
and protection he enjoys here?

01:32:42.559 --> 01:32:48.122
Besides, you've done him a special favor
by introducing him to your wife.

01:32:48.231 --> 01:32:50.791
He's taking full advantage of that!

01:32:51.301 --> 01:32:54.828
l had no idea he had changed so much.

01:32:54.938 --> 01:33:00.570
All this adulation has gone to his head.

01:33:02.545 --> 01:33:07.915
l think it comes from
a deep sense of frustration.

01:33:09.352 --> 01:33:12.048
Despite all his gifts,

01:33:12.922 --> 01:33:15.288
he hasn't really accomplished anything.

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:21.554
Sometimes, l feel pity for him.

01:33:21.664 --> 01:33:24.462
This is no time for pity, Nikhil.

01:33:25.168 --> 01:33:29.730
You can't bring yourself to be firm
with him because he's close to you.

01:33:29.839 --> 01:33:31.807
You're hesitating.

01:33:32.175 --> 01:33:36.737
But l fail to see why you're
vacillating at a time like this.

01:33:37.747 --> 01:33:39.510
You would if l told you.

01:33:41.384 --> 01:33:43.249
But l can't.

01:36:32.555 --> 01:36:34.079
Remember this?

01:36:42.398 --> 01:36:44.992
lt's from my soap factory.

01:36:49.839 --> 01:36:53.331
You saved it?
-- Not just the soap.

01:36:55.645 --> 01:36:59.376
Towels, pens, matches.
l kept everything.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.444
Have you ever used it?

01:37:08.891 --> 01:37:13.453
lt's no good for anything,
not even for washing clothes.

01:37:19.569 --> 01:37:22.163
What foolish notions l had back then.

01:37:22.271 --> 01:37:23.966
You still do.

01:37:25.208 --> 01:37:29.235
You freed her from her moorings.
Now look where she's drifted.

01:37:32.281 --> 01:37:35.876
-- That was no foolish notion.
-- You still think so?

01:37:41.158 --> 01:37:43.854
lf she likes what she's doing,

01:37:44.962 --> 01:37:47.055
then that's the kind of person she is.

01:37:48.265 --> 01:37:50.529
l could prevent her from going out,

01:37:51.301 --> 01:37:53.565
but that wouldn't change who she is.

01:37:55.072 --> 01:37:56.835
She's not a child.

01:37:57.374 --> 01:37:58.864
lsn't the husband the master?

01:38:01.578 --> 01:38:04.274
Bending her to my will wouldn't be difficult,

01:38:04.548 --> 01:38:05.845
but it wouldn't help.

01:38:07.518 --> 01:38:09.543
At least get rid of him.

01:38:10.687 --> 01:38:13.520
He's not much of a friend, is he?

01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:19.918
lt would certainly be better for my estate

01:38:20.864 --> 01:38:23.094
if he were to leave.

01:38:24.334 --> 01:38:28.134
But l'm a selfish person.

01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:34.666
l can't stop thinking about myself.
l just can't help it.

01:38:36.313 --> 01:38:39.373
lf he leaves, you'll soon find her
back by your side.

01:38:40.851 --> 01:38:42.341
l know.

01:38:43.654 --> 01:38:48.853
But l would find her regretting it,

01:38:50.194 --> 01:38:54.790
because it wouldn't be her decision.

01:38:55.933 --> 01:38:57.958
That would be unbearable,

01:38:59.203 --> 01:39:01.194
both for her...

01:39:02.139 --> 01:39:04.630
and for me.

01:39:09.012 --> 01:39:11.037
l can't do it.

01:39:11.181 --> 01:39:13.479
Hail Motherland!

01:40:02.165 --> 01:40:04.133
<i>HaiI MotherIand.</i>

01:40:04.234 --> 01:40:05.929
What happened?

01:40:06.036 --> 01:40:10.302
Why are you so late?
-- lt was a lot of work.

01:40:11.074 --> 01:40:13.269
There's a play in Chandrapur tonight.

01:40:13.377 --> 01:40:16.107
l had to wait for the boatmen to go there.

01:40:16.213 --> 01:40:19.944
This kind of work can't be done
if there are people around.

01:40:20.050 --> 01:40:22.041
Mirjan's boat?

01:40:25.355 --> 01:40:29.519
But when he comes back
and finds his boat missing,

01:40:29.626 --> 01:40:31.560
it won't take him long
to put two and two together,

01:40:31.662 --> 01:40:35.564
and then he'll come groveling to you.

01:40:35.832 --> 01:40:39.893
You'll have to give him some compensation.

01:40:40.837 --> 01:40:45.206
Keep around 5,000 rupees handy.

01:40:48.645 --> 01:40:51.671
-- Let me see.
-- A word of advice.

01:40:52.983 --> 01:40:57.682
Can l be frank with you?

01:40:57.788 --> 01:40:59.722
Out with it. lt's late.

01:41:00.524 --> 01:41:06.053
l think you should finish things up
quickly here and leave.

01:41:09.599 --> 01:41:12.966
-- Why?
-- Things aren't looking good.

01:41:13.503 --> 01:41:15.471
There could be a riot.

01:41:15.939 --> 01:41:17.600
You may be a leader,

01:41:17.708 --> 01:41:22.577
but you're not exactly
a popular one, you know.

01:41:23.013 --> 01:41:27.177
They're certainly not going
to put you on a pedestal.

01:41:31.154 --> 01:41:33.952
l'll decide what to do.

01:41:34.324 --> 01:41:36.918
You don't need to worry about it.

01:41:41.264 --> 01:41:45.132
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

01:41:45.235 --> 01:41:49.001
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

01:41:49.106 --> 01:41:52.974
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

01:41:53.076 --> 01:41:56.705
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

01:41:56.813 --> 01:42:00.613
<i>The strong, the brave, the proud</i>

01:42:00.717 --> 01:42:04.551
<i>To serve the nation's cause</i>

01:42:04.654 --> 01:42:08.351
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:12.656
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

01:42:14.264 --> 01:42:16.698
You should give up Swadeshi
and take up singing.

01:42:17.334 --> 01:42:22.567
l once considered becoming an actor.

01:42:22.939 --> 01:42:26.568
lt's wonderful to be able to hold
a large audience in your grip.

01:42:27.711 --> 01:42:31.442
l was thinking that when l heard
you speak the other evening.

01:42:32.749 --> 01:42:34.444
Of course...

01:42:34.885 --> 01:42:39.720
it's nothing like winning
the heart of a woman.

01:42:41.491 --> 01:42:45.086
l gather you've won
the hearts of many women,

01:42:45.662 --> 01:42:47.323
both Swadeshi...

01:42:48.231 --> 01:42:49.630
and foreign.

01:42:49.733 --> 01:42:51.496
Good God!

01:42:51.768 --> 01:42:53.861
Has Nikhil told you all this?

01:42:54.838 --> 01:42:57.068
You know so much about me.

01:42:57.174 --> 01:42:59.142
Why shouldn't l know something about you?

01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:01.903
You know what they were?

01:43:02.012 --> 01:43:05.573
Youthful indiscretions.
lt's ancient history.

01:43:06.316 --> 01:43:09.080
l wonder what happened to those women.

01:43:09.619 --> 01:43:11.348
You shouldn't, queen bee.

01:43:11.455 --> 01:43:15.084
l'm no longer the same person.
You know that.

01:43:15.859 --> 01:43:18.657
Still, it's helpful in understanding
a person's character.

01:43:19.463 --> 01:43:22.023
lt's not difficult to understand men.

01:43:22.132 --> 01:43:24.066
lt's women who are unfathomable.

01:43:24.534 --> 01:43:27.628
One despairs of knowing their minds.

01:43:27.737 --> 01:43:30.934
You know that song, don't you?
-- What song?

01:43:31.808 --> 01:43:37.747
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:43:37.848 --> 01:43:41.284
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:43:41.384 --> 01:43:44.615
<i>Her siIence means more</i>
<i>than what she says</i>

01:43:44.721 --> 01:43:47.053
<i>She Iooks at you,</i>
<i>then drops her eyes</i>

01:43:47.157 --> 01:43:49.523
<i>Her siIence means more</i>
<i>than what she says</i>

01:43:49.626 --> 01:43:51.992
<i>She Iooks at you,</i>
<i>then drops her eyes</i>

01:43:52.095 --> 01:43:54.563
<i>She Iaughs one moment</i>
<i>The next she cries</i>

01:43:55.565 --> 01:43:57.931
<i>She Iaughs one moment</i>
<i>The next she cries</i>

01:43:58.034 --> 01:44:01.492
<i>She Iingers cIose,</i>
<i>then Ieaves you in a daze</i>

01:44:01.605 --> 01:44:07.601
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:44:07.711 --> 01:44:11.169
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

01:44:11.781 --> 01:44:14.978
ls that why you never married?

01:44:16.052 --> 01:44:21.251
How can l marry if l can't find a woman
after my own heart, queen bee?

01:44:21.358 --> 01:44:24.623
l waited a long time for you last night.

01:44:24.895 --> 01:44:26.692
You never came.

01:44:29.132 --> 01:44:31.123
Forgive me, my queen bee.

01:44:31.868 --> 01:44:34.860
l was very busy.
l got back late.

01:44:34.971 --> 01:44:39.738
-- Busy with what?
-- The Swadeshi cause, of course.

01:44:39.843 --> 01:44:42.937
-- Giving speeches?
-- No.

01:44:43.046 --> 01:44:44.673
What, then?

01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:48.174
Winding things up.

01:44:49.286 --> 01:44:52.119
l can't stay here forever, you know.

01:44:53.456 --> 01:44:55.924
We have to be constantly
on the move, campaigning.

01:44:59.062 --> 01:45:01.257
You're leaving?

01:45:03.133 --> 01:45:04.896
l have to go sooner or later.

01:45:08.205 --> 01:45:10.673
What if your queen bee doesn't let you?

01:45:14.444 --> 01:45:17.038
No one would be happier than me.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.176
But l'm not planning on leaving just yet.

01:45:20.283 --> 01:45:22.148
There are still problems to be resolved.

01:45:23.787 --> 01:45:26.255
-- Will you tell me?
-- What?

01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:28.948
How much money do you need?

01:45:36.833 --> 01:45:38.391
What is it?

01:45:39.636 --> 01:45:41.069
How much?

01:45:41.905 --> 01:45:43.770
About five thousand.

01:45:43.873 --> 01:45:46.341
We spent more
than we were planning to.

01:45:46.443 --> 01:45:50.607
lf l get you the money,
you'll have to take it without question.

01:45:52.048 --> 01:45:55.779
lf you say so, but you mustn't
part with your jewelry.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.286
When l said money,
l meant money.

01:46:02.459 --> 01:46:03.949
What if l can't repay you?

01:46:04.894 --> 01:46:07.021
l don't expect you to.

01:46:07.464 --> 01:46:10.262
Can't l at least do this much for Swadeshi?

01:46:12.302 --> 01:46:15.430
-- l'm worried, queen bee.
-- Why?

01:46:17.107 --> 01:46:19.871
l seem to have become a burden to you.

01:46:19.976 --> 01:46:24.276
But there's no other way. l can explain.
-- You don't have to.

01:46:24.714 --> 01:46:29.674
Just tell me one thing.
-- What?

01:46:31.021 --> 01:46:35.185
-- lf l give you the money, will you stay?
-- Do you think l want to leave you?

01:46:37.494 --> 01:46:40.156
Then why did you say
you were going to leave?

01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:44.161
After all the torment l've been through.

01:46:44.267 --> 01:46:47.065
l did it all for you,

01:46:47.170 --> 01:46:49.434
and you --

01:46:50.707 --> 01:46:52.106
Queen bee.

01:47:42.192 --> 01:47:43.716
<i>Brothers!</i>

01:47:44.527 --> 01:47:49.157
<i>The Hindus ask you to join hands</i>
<i>with them for the Swadeshi cause.</i>

01:47:49.532 --> 01:47:51.932
<i>They wheedIe you.</i>

01:47:52.202 --> 01:47:54.329
<i>They coax you.</i>

01:47:54.437 --> 01:47:56.302
<i>They even threaten you.</i>

01:47:56.406 --> 01:47:59.466
<i>They want you to join them at aII costs,</i>
<i>but don't Iisten to them, brothers.</i>

01:47:59.576 --> 01:48:02.568
<i>Remember they don't want our betterment.</i>

01:48:03.246 --> 01:48:07.774
<i>The Hindus don't care about your weII-being.</i>

01:48:08.284 --> 01:48:13.881
<i>Whatever they say is not</i>
<i>for the benefit of our community.</i>

01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:17.949
<i>The Hindus have never</i>
<i>cared about our weII-being.</i>

01:48:18.061 --> 01:48:21.758
<i>The Hindus want to keep us MusIims</i>
<i>under their heeIs forever.</i>

01:48:21.865 --> 01:48:25.266
<i>That is their onIy objective.</i>

01:48:26.569 --> 01:48:29.732
<i>But remember one thing.</i>

01:48:29.839 --> 01:48:34.970
<i>By the grace of AIIah,</i>
<i>MusIims are the majority in BengaI.</i>

01:48:35.078 --> 01:48:37.205
<i>You are the farmers.</i>

01:48:37.313 --> 01:48:41.340
<i>The weaIth of this country</i>
<i>comes from its Iand.</i>

01:48:41.451 --> 01:48:43.442
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:48.684
<i>No part of this weaIth</i>
<i>is produced by the Hindus.</i>

01:48:48.792 --> 01:48:52.660
<i>It's your hard work that made them weaIthy.</i>

01:48:53.296 --> 01:48:58.393
<i>They have no right</i>
<i>to the fruits of your Iabors.</i>

01:48:58.501 --> 01:49:00.662
This is your hard--earned money.

01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:04.171
The Hindus have no right to it.

01:49:04.974 --> 01:49:07.465
Listen to me, brother Muslims.

01:49:08.211 --> 01:49:10.805
Don't listen to the Hindus.

01:49:11.181 --> 01:49:13.911
Don't get mixed up in their politics.

01:49:14.017 --> 01:49:15.814
Swadeshi is not for you.

01:49:17.954 --> 01:49:22.482
You are the leaders
of the Hindu community in Sukhsayar.

01:49:23.393 --> 01:49:27.762
l've called you here to tell you one thing.

01:49:28.865 --> 01:49:32.892
You are men of wisdom
and good judgment.

01:49:33.536 --> 01:49:36.437
l think you will appreciate
what l am going to say to you.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.371
l have faith in you.

01:49:39.509 --> 01:49:41.739
l just wanted to say...

01:49:42.979 --> 01:49:46.210
that we can stay true
to our own religious beliefs,

01:49:46.916 --> 01:49:49.612
but we shouldn't interfere
with the beliefs of others.

01:49:50.987 --> 01:49:53.387
Even as a follower of <i>Vaishnavism,</i>

01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:57.482
l can't prevent a follower of <i>Shaktism</i>
from spilling the blood of animals.

01:49:58.294 --> 01:50:02.822
And so, similarly...

01:50:03.266 --> 01:50:06.394
we should let the Muslims
follow their own religious convictions.

01:50:06.503 --> 01:50:10.030
Maharaja, the Muslims in this village
never used to slaughter cows,

01:50:10.139 --> 01:50:14.439
but l've heard they do now.

01:50:14.544 --> 01:50:15.238
Yes.

01:50:16.713 --> 01:50:18.738
l've heard that too.

01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:24.779
But l strongly believe that
they've been manipulated into doing so.

01:50:25.221 --> 01:50:27.280
They've been convinced to do it,

01:50:27.857 --> 01:50:30.849
in order to stir up trouble
between our two religions.

01:50:33.096 --> 01:50:35.496
Please don't add fuel to the fire.

01:50:35.598 --> 01:50:38.624
They won't stop unless
you put them back in their place.

01:50:38.735 --> 01:50:40.635
The good old days are gone.

01:50:41.971 --> 01:50:43.404
Listen.

01:50:44.774 --> 01:50:47.242
Muslims are a part of lndia.

01:50:48.177 --> 01:50:51.578
This is a historical fact.

01:50:53.082 --> 01:50:55.607
You must accept this fact.

01:50:57.487 --> 01:51:02.322
We can't imagine an lndia without Muslims.

01:51:03.793 --> 01:51:05.693
lf we try to put them in their place,

01:51:06.195 --> 01:51:08.993
it won't stop them from slaughtering cows.

01:51:09.666 --> 01:51:12.362
lt may even lead to them slaughtering men.

01:51:15.338 --> 01:51:21.402
That's never been truer than now,
in the present state of unrest and turmoil.

01:51:22.812 --> 01:51:29.479
You now have a grave responsibility.

01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:38.254
l beg you, l beseech you,

01:51:39.729 --> 01:51:42.562
do not encourage hatred.

01:51:44.067 --> 01:51:49.699
lf you do so now,
you are courting disaster.

01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:06.712
Hail Motherland.

01:52:44.527 --> 01:52:46.017
Nikhil.

01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:49.462
Did you hear a shot?
-- Yes, l did.

01:52:50.533 --> 01:52:52.000
-- What now?
-- l know.

01:52:54.037 --> 01:52:56.232
l know what must be done.

01:52:56.506 --> 01:52:58.098
But first of all,

01:52:58.207 --> 01:53:02.109
take my carriage, go home
and come back with all your belongings.

01:53:02.412 --> 01:53:05.381
The roads aren't safe anymore.
l don't want anything to happen to you.

01:53:06.416 --> 01:53:08.441
That sounds fine, but --

01:53:10.053 --> 01:53:12.681
l'll tell Sandip right away.

01:53:43.019 --> 01:53:44.782
Time's running out, queen bee.

01:53:44.887 --> 01:53:46.912
l need the money now.

01:53:55.164 --> 01:53:56.791
What's that?

01:53:56.899 --> 01:53:58.526
Can't you guess?

01:53:59.802 --> 01:54:01.292
Money?

01:54:01.804 --> 01:54:05.331
So little? There can't be
more than 500 in those bags.

01:54:05.975 --> 01:54:09.342
You must have forgotten.
l asked for 5,000 rupees.

01:54:15.151 --> 01:54:16.743
What's this?

01:54:18.054 --> 01:54:19.248
Gold coins?

01:54:28.531 --> 01:54:29.862
Gold.

01:54:32.301 --> 01:54:34.531
Gold.

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:40.204
You should have told me.

01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:43.237
How else would l know?

01:54:45.748 --> 01:54:47.739
Please don't be angry, my queen bee.

01:54:54.657 --> 01:54:57.922
-- l need to talk to you.
-- About what?

01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:01.389
l don't want you to stay here any longer.

01:55:01.497 --> 01:55:03.590
Things have taken a serious turn.

01:55:03.699 --> 01:55:06.327
Your presence may make matters worse.

01:55:07.436 --> 01:55:09.802
l want you to leave Sukhsayar
by tomorrow morning.

01:55:11.941 --> 01:55:14.637
Am l supposed to take orders from you?

01:55:14.744 --> 01:55:16.211
lt's not that.

01:55:17.613 --> 01:55:20.480
lf you leave for Calcutta,
it will be good for you,

01:55:21.384 --> 01:55:22.851
and for Sukhsayar as well.

01:55:24.086 --> 01:55:27.544
-- l have no work to do in Calcutta.
-- All the more reason to go.

01:55:28.591 --> 01:55:31.151
You've done too much work here.

01:55:32.962 --> 01:55:35.760
Don't think l haven't been
informed of your activities.

01:55:36.599 --> 01:55:39.534
From setting fire to the peasants' barns
to sinking Mirjan's boat,

01:55:40.503 --> 01:55:43.097
l've been informed of everything.

01:55:44.373 --> 01:55:47.206
You speak of unity
between Hindus and Muslims,

01:55:47.944 --> 01:55:50.879
but, in fact, you oppress Muslims.

01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:54.611
l won't tolerate it anymore.

01:55:56.953 --> 01:55:59.444
l may not believe in Swadeshi,

01:56:00.456 --> 01:56:03.118
but l truly admire
some Swadeshi leaders.

01:56:04.227 --> 01:56:09.529
But l don't admire those
whose actions belie their words.

01:56:10.766 --> 01:56:13.360
You're not saving the country.
You're ruining it.

01:56:14.604 --> 01:56:17.573
l won't allow this to go on in my estate.

01:56:17.673 --> 01:56:21.302
There's only one person here
l'm prepared to obey.

01:56:23.579 --> 01:56:25.410
Queen bee...

01:56:25.915 --> 01:56:29.180
Do you want me to stay or not?

01:56:38.027 --> 01:56:39.551
Queen bee.

01:56:40.596 --> 01:56:42.894
l'm waiting for your answer.

01:56:44.533 --> 01:56:47.366
Do you want me to leave?

01:56:50.006 --> 01:56:51.974
Please tell me, queen bee.

01:56:53.509 --> 01:56:55.443
l've said what l came to say.

01:56:58.047 --> 01:57:00.413
l hope l won't have to repeat it.

01:57:05.021 --> 01:57:06.852
Queen bee.

01:57:09.125 --> 01:57:11.252
What's the matter with you?

01:57:14.997 --> 01:57:17.898
You suddenly --
-- ls Amulya in your room?

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.865
-- Amulya?
-- Yes.

01:57:19.969 --> 01:57:20.993
Why?

01:57:21.103 --> 01:57:24.004
Send him to me. lt's urgent.

01:57:24.707 --> 01:57:27.335
Can't you tell me why?

01:57:27.643 --> 01:57:29.702
No, l'll tell Amulya.

01:57:29.812 --> 01:57:31.780
Please send him to me.

01:57:31.881 --> 01:57:33.940
lt's my request.

01:57:35.151 --> 01:57:36.880
Very well.

01:59:13.516 --> 01:59:14.915
Amulya?

01:59:16.353 --> 01:59:19.550
Can you do me a favor?
-- Of course. What is it?

01:59:19.656 --> 01:59:20.953
Go to Calcutta.

01:59:21.058 --> 01:59:23.856
You can take the morning train
and return in the evening.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:26.087
The money for the journey is in this box.

01:59:26.196 --> 01:59:29.256
-- What's this box?
-- lt's my jewelry box.

01:59:29.366 --> 01:59:33.029
l need 5,000 rupees. Sell some
of my jewelry and bring me the money.

01:59:33.136 --> 01:59:35.229
l don't need any jewelry.
l can get you the money.

01:59:35.338 --> 01:59:36.669
How?

01:59:36.773 --> 01:59:39.708
This is not a small amount
we're talking about.

01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:41.175
l'll get it.

01:59:41.278 --> 01:59:43.405
No, do as l tell you.

01:59:44.014 --> 01:59:46.983
But why did you give
Mr. Sandip 5,000 rupees?

01:59:47.084 --> 01:59:48.949
He said he needed that much.

01:59:49.052 --> 01:59:52.749
No, according to our calculations,
we only needed 3,500.

01:59:52.856 --> 01:59:55.256
lf you give him more,
he spends it on himself.

01:59:56.026 --> 01:59:59.826
He's quite a spender.
He always travels first--class.

02:00:00.931 --> 02:00:02.990
-- Sandip?
-- Yes, sister.

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:06.968
He says hardship saps a leader's strength.

02:00:07.804 --> 02:00:11.069
Well, l can't take back
what l've already given.

02:00:11.174 --> 02:00:14.007
He might need it in the future.
You get me the 5,000.

02:00:14.611 --> 02:00:17.978
Put the box away.
l'll get you the money tonight.

02:00:18.081 --> 02:00:20.015
-- How?
-- From the treasury.

02:00:21.017 --> 02:00:24.316
Are you insane?
What about the guards?

02:00:24.421 --> 02:00:26.446
We carry weapons, sister.

02:00:34.397 --> 02:00:36.558
Good heavens!

02:00:37.267 --> 02:00:39.326
Why are you upset, sister?

02:00:39.436 --> 02:00:41.529
We need funding
to carry out our work for the nation.

02:00:42.873 --> 02:00:44.841
Doesn't it bother you that you're stealing?

02:00:44.941 --> 02:00:46.841
Why?
Whose money is it?

02:00:46.943 --> 02:00:49.810
Mine today,
the moneylender's tomorrow.

02:00:49.913 --> 02:00:53.542
Why not use it for the cause?
-- No, Amulya.

02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:57.950
lf you go robbing treasuries,
l'll die of fear.

02:00:58.054 --> 02:01:00.318
Listen, you may not need
to sell all the jewelry.

02:01:00.423 --> 02:01:04.450
Sell as much as you need to
and bring back the rest.

02:01:05.462 --> 02:01:08.363
Take the box and carry it safely.

02:01:08.465 --> 02:01:11.366
And be careful, for heaven's sake.

02:01:12.302 --> 02:01:13.769
Very well, sister.

02:01:17.674 --> 02:01:20.040
l'll take my leave.
-- Okay.

02:01:44.067 --> 02:01:45.830
<i>Queen bee.</i>

02:01:55.512 --> 02:01:57.241
Are you leaving?

02:01:57.347 --> 02:01:59.611
ls there any reason for me to stay?

02:01:59.716 --> 02:02:01.707
Why do you say that?

02:02:01.818 --> 02:02:04.446
Can't you hear the note of discord?

02:02:05.488 --> 02:02:08.821
lf l've done anything wrong,
please forgive me.

02:02:08.925 --> 02:02:10.893
Don't leave like this.

02:02:11.428 --> 02:02:16.127
My husband said, ''The less one
knows you, the better one likes you''.

02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.564
Perhaps l know you too well.

02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:21.569
Don't say that, queen bee.

02:02:22.005 --> 02:02:24.735
Has knowing me meant nothing to you?

02:02:25.008 --> 02:02:26.908
Has it all been in vain?

02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:30.207
l believed you would
succeed in your endeavor.

02:02:30.313 --> 02:02:32.213
l wanted you to.

02:02:32.315 --> 02:02:34.579
But not anymore?

02:03:00.644 --> 02:03:03.238
<i>AIIah is great!</i>

02:03:57.334 --> 02:03:59.302
Kasim?

02:04:06.242 --> 02:04:07.709
Hands up.

02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.104
Hands up.

02:04:14.417 --> 02:04:15.611
Go inside.

02:04:15.719 --> 02:04:16.879
Go inside!

02:04:23.426 --> 02:04:24.620
Move.

02:04:27.097 --> 02:04:28.530
Turn around.

02:04:29.432 --> 02:04:31.024
Turn!

02:04:35.004 --> 02:04:36.938
Now open the safe.

02:04:37.607 --> 02:04:39.074
Open it!

02:04:44.114 --> 02:04:47.242
Take out 3,500 rupees.

02:04:48.017 --> 02:04:51.350
What's going on?
What's all the commotion?

02:04:51.621 --> 02:04:53.714
ls there a problem?

02:04:55.024 --> 02:04:56.753
l don't know.

02:04:57.427 --> 02:04:59.019
l hope it's not a riot.

02:04:59.129 --> 02:05:01.120
What are you saying?

02:05:01.464 --> 02:05:04.627
What will happen to us
if there's a riot here?

02:05:06.169 --> 02:05:08.364
We're going to Calcutta tomorrow.

02:05:09.205 --> 02:05:10.832
lt's no longer safe here.

02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:13.738
Who is ''we''?
Am l not coming with you?

02:05:16.513 --> 02:05:18.413
Did l say that?

02:05:20.517 --> 02:05:22.382
l'm so relieved.

02:05:22.485 --> 02:05:24.612
A treasury was looted nearby.

02:05:24.721 --> 02:05:27.588
What's to stop them from looting this place?

02:05:27.690 --> 02:05:31.353
lf they kill me, they'll burn my body
by that shriveled banyan tree.

02:05:31.461 --> 02:05:33.019
That would be awful.

02:05:34.964 --> 02:05:36.761
Go and get ready.

02:05:36.866 --> 02:05:38.697
Pack your things.

02:05:40.437 --> 02:05:42.701
You're serious about leaving, aren't you?

02:05:43.306 --> 02:05:45.331
l'm always serious.

02:05:46.376 --> 02:05:48.344
Don't you know me by now?

02:06:12.635 --> 02:06:14.330
Bimala?

02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:19.108
l have to tell you something.

02:06:19.209 --> 02:06:20.801
What is it?

02:06:21.077 --> 02:06:25.537
There were 5,000 rupees
in gold coins in two bags in the safe.

02:06:25.815 --> 02:06:27.749
l gave them to Sandip.

02:06:28.351 --> 02:06:30.285
He needed the money.

02:06:31.087 --> 02:06:34.989
Now you know how hard
it is to refuse him.

02:06:35.091 --> 02:06:36.490
l'll pay the money back.

02:06:36.993 --> 02:06:38.858
l gave Amulya my jewelry box.

02:06:38.962 --> 02:06:41.021
He'll sell my jewels and bring the money.

02:06:46.736 --> 02:06:51.935
l felt bad speaking to Sandip
like that in front of you.

02:06:54.377 --> 02:06:56.470
But l had to, Bimala.

02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:58.845
Things have taken a bad turn.

02:07:03.853 --> 02:07:06.788
lt's no longer safe for him to work here.

02:07:07.724 --> 02:07:10.249
But what about you?

02:07:13.963 --> 02:07:16.727
Your safety is what concerns me.

02:07:17.133 --> 02:07:20.728
No one else matters to me anymore.

02:07:21.538 --> 02:07:24.735
Tomorrow, we're going to Calcutta.

02:07:25.308 --> 02:07:27.037
All three of us.

02:07:28.077 --> 02:07:30.602
And if something happens before then?

02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:34.608
You won't leave the house, will you?

02:07:37.721 --> 02:07:41.248
lf something happens,
l'll have to go and intervene, Bimala.

02:07:46.063 --> 02:07:47.621
l knew it.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.231
l knew l'd be punished.

02:07:54.337 --> 02:07:56.771
l'll be punished.

02:07:59.943 --> 02:08:01.808
Punished? Why, Bimala?

02:08:02.679 --> 02:08:05.239
You haven't done anything wrong.

02:08:06.783 --> 02:08:11.652
l don't even have the right
to ask you for forgiveness.

02:08:13.890 --> 02:08:17.417
But you've come back to me,
haven't you?

02:08:18.662 --> 02:08:20.960
Haven't you, Bimala?

02:08:29.206 --> 02:08:33.905
lt seems like ages since l last
looked at you and spoke to you.

02:08:35.879 --> 02:08:37.972
What came over me?

02:08:38.715 --> 02:08:41.240
Why did this happen?

02:08:43.086 --> 02:08:44.883
You've done nothing wrong, Bimala.

02:08:45.922 --> 02:08:49.255
For ten years, you never saw
another man besides me.

02:08:51.161 --> 02:08:53.152
Don't forget that.

02:09:25.228 --> 02:09:27.423
There's 3,500 rupees here.

02:09:28.331 --> 02:09:31.562
Please return the jewelry box
and the gold coins.

02:09:32.836 --> 02:09:36.169
Where did you get that money?
Where have you been?

02:09:37.073 --> 02:09:39.064
To the treasury.

02:09:40.177 --> 02:09:41.405
l hope nobody saw you.

02:09:49.653 --> 02:09:51.518
l had my face covered.

02:09:51.855 --> 02:09:54.790
Did you see any trouble in the village?
-- There's a riot.

02:09:56.893 --> 02:10:00.090
The Muslims have broken
into the temple of Visalakshi.

02:10:10.574 --> 02:10:12.337
Are you leaving?

02:10:13.944 --> 02:10:15.571
Yes. To Rangpur.

02:10:20.917 --> 02:10:22.111
Will you come with me?

02:10:35.799 --> 02:10:37.198
l must go now.

02:10:45.475 --> 02:10:47.102
Hail Motherland.

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:05.218
What are you thinking?

02:11:06.463 --> 02:11:08.124
Nothing.

02:11:09.799 --> 02:11:12.267
l don't want to think.

02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:15.563
l want to forget.

02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:20.303
Everything that's happened
in the last few days.

02:11:20.777 --> 02:11:23.678
Forget? But why?

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:24.542
Nikhil!

02:11:28.084 --> 02:11:30.075
Come in, Sandip.

02:11:33.256 --> 02:11:35.486
This is the age of breaking rules.

02:11:36.226 --> 02:11:38.421
Your wife came out of her confinement,

02:11:38.528 --> 02:11:40.428
and now l've invaded
the privacy of your bedroom.

02:11:40.530 --> 02:11:42.464
l hope you'll forgive me.

02:11:44.934 --> 02:11:49.030
These are your property,
which l duly return.

02:11:49.806 --> 02:11:52.673
One jewelry box
and two bags of gold coins.

02:11:53.677 --> 02:11:55.144
The jewelry box?

02:11:55.912 --> 02:11:59.678
Your devotee didn't take it with him,
but he brought me the money.

02:12:03.086 --> 02:12:08.023
Since you have your valuables, l hope
you won't mind me keeping the money.

02:12:08.124 --> 02:12:10.422
-- Are you leaving?
-- Yes, Nikhil.

02:12:11.394 --> 02:12:14.022
The train to Rangpur leaves in an hour.

02:12:16.232 --> 02:12:19.531
Do you hear that?
The riots have started.

02:12:19.636 --> 02:12:21.365
Amulya saw them.

02:12:21.671 --> 02:12:26.267
And now l must make
my proverbial escape.

02:12:26.576 --> 02:12:27.907
l must live.

02:12:28.678 --> 02:12:30.908
l have a lot of work left to do.

02:12:31.181 --> 02:12:33.706
Don't make the same mistake again.

02:12:33.817 --> 02:12:36.081
Can't you see the results of your actions?

02:12:37.053 --> 02:12:39.248
l follow the <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> Nikhil.

02:12:39.522 --> 02:12:43.458
l am concerned only
with the action, not the result.

02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:47.860
And l consider Ravana to be
the hero of Ramayana, not Rama.

02:12:47.964 --> 02:12:50.899
So l can't accept advice
from the followers of Rama.

02:12:52.035 --> 02:12:53.935
The easy road isn't for me, Nikhil.

02:12:55.605 --> 02:12:57.300
l'll take my leave.

02:13:02.679 --> 02:13:04.772
This will stay with me.

02:13:10.086 --> 02:13:12.077
l'm keeping this as a memento.

02:13:13.089 --> 02:13:15.421
Who knows if we'll ever meet again?

02:13:18.194 --> 02:13:19.491
Good--bye, Nikhil.

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:25.758
Queen bee.

02:13:31.841 --> 02:13:34.139
Hail Motherland.

02:14:09.313 --> 02:14:11.213
Courage, Bimala.

02:14:12.716 --> 02:14:16.277
l must go out to them now.
-- No! l won't let you!

02:14:16.386 --> 02:14:17.751
l must.

02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:22.153
Please don't stop me.

02:14:23.593 --> 02:14:25.151
My dear.

02:14:56.493 --> 02:14:59.394
-- You let him go?
-- We tried to stop him.

02:14:59.446 --> 02:15:01.141
He wouldn't listen to us!

02:15:02.482 --> 02:15:04.279
You witch!

02:15:04.985 --> 02:15:08.921
You sent him to his death!

02:15:09.556 --> 02:15:13.788
Have you no pity
in your heart of stone?
