Scenario, music and
direction by Satyajit Ray

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.800
I have passed through fire

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.960
What was impure in me ...

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.080
... has been burnt to ashes

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.120
What remains, I dedicate to him ...

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.080
... who received all my failings
in the depths of his stricken heart

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.320
Now I know there is not one like him

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.160
It was ten years ago
that I first met him

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:27.040
He was the son of a noble
family and I was his bride

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.480
I heard that my husband
was of gentle disposition

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.360
I considered myself
fortunate; not every bride is so lucky

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.520
My sister-in-law was
already in widow's whites ...

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.880
... when I entered this household

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.920
Even though one wouldn't
know by looking at her..

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.920
..I knew my sister-in-law hadn't got
any happiness in her married life.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.920
Our place was in the inner
apartments of the palace

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.840
A passage with stained glass windows

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.800
led to the outer apartments

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:20.720
For us, the door this
passage was always closed

00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:23.600
As one brought up to follow convention

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.320
I did not mind the seclusion.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:31.160
But my husband had modern views

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:36.280
He was the first in his family
to have had a Western education.

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:42.160
Miss Gilby was appointed to
make a memsahib out of me.

00:04:49.984 --> 00:04:55.680
Tell me the tale that to me was a dear

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.986
Tell me the tale that to me was a dear

00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:06.275
Long long ago... Long long ago...

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:11.800
Long long ago... Long long ago...

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.325
Sing me the song that
I would like to hear

00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:22.644
Sing me the song that
I would like to hear

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.400
Long long ago... Long ago...

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:32.688
Long long ago... Long ago...

00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:38.648
Now you are calm was my greatest remote

00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:44.168
Now you are calm was my greatest remote

00:05:44.248 --> 00:05:49.368
Let me forget that the long you've wrote

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:54.848
Let me forget that the long you've wrote

00:05:54.928 --> 00:06:00.168
Let me believe that you long for a love

00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:05.688
Let me believe that you long for a love

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:09.928
Long long ago... Long ago...

00:06:20.508 --> 00:06:22.501
Good morning Mr. Choudhury
- Good morning

00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:24.448
I was hoping that you'd
come one of these days

00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:26.648
And how's your pupil today

00:06:26.727 --> 00:06:28.487
Of course, she is ok

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:31.088
What did you learn today, Bimala?

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.207
Nothing

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:35.927
Oh! Don't be naughty

00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:38.927
She has very good progress

00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:41.327
We had ten minutes conversation today

00:06:41.408 --> 00:06:41.927
Really !

00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:43.767
And history and geography

00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:46.167
And her grammar improving so much

00:06:46.328 --> 00:06:49.928
She wrote a very good essay
about the birds in a garden

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:51.927
I think she can saying

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.308
Why, didn't you know?

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.528
No, she told me she couldn't say

00:06:56.607 --> 00:06:58.791
Really... Bimala

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:00.327
You are a impossible

00:07:01.017 --> 00:07:04.208
I asked several times
but she never sung for me

00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:05.927
Oh that ... really

00:07:06.608 --> 00:07:10.074
Bimala, have you
learn how to pour a tea?

00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:11.207
No.

00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:14.288
Yes she has, and she did for you

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.367
Why did you have to come here?

00:07:23.034 --> 00:07:28.527
Soon even my dress began to
show Miss Gilby's influences

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:47.007
English jackets, English songs.

00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:48.906
Your sister-in-law will
seem a stranger to you.

00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:50.190
You have not told me how I look

00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:51.266
Pretty as a picture

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.227
You're a lucky one

00:07:56.306 --> 00:08:00.746
You should grab your
good fortune with both hands

00:08:03.746 --> 00:08:07.626
Few brides have known
happiness in this family

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:11.627
Hardly knowing their husband's face ...

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:13.266
... let alone the face of happiness

00:08:15.107 --> 00:08:19.586
I used to wait up for him all night,
hoping he'd come to me

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:26.867
For the two days before he
died I was at his bedside ...

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:33.066
... as he lay dazed with fever

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:40.466
Suddenly he opened his eyes and said :

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:43.586
"Who are you ? "

00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:51.266
He didn't even know his own wife

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.146
I wonder if you realize ...

00:08:57.587 --> 00:08:59.306
... how lucky you are

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.826
Why shouldn't I ?

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:05.147
Don't I know my own ...

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:09.146
Why, we were just talking about you

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.506
Really ?

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:15.266
I thought only little
girls played with dolls; ...

00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:18.066
... now I see even men have dolls

00:09:18.146 --> 00:09:19.026
What do you mean ?

00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:22.626
Can't you see before you ?

00:09:23.106 --> 00:09:24.107
I see.

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:25.826
It's for you she's dolling up

00:09:26.786 --> 00:09:28.307
Well, you know ...

00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:33.107
... men must have their little fancies

00:09:35.322 --> 00:09:36.227
Enjoy them

00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:42.906
I'll watch from the wings

00:09:43.047 --> 00:09:46.767
Why from the wings ?

00:09:48.047 --> 00:09:49.127
It's best that way

00:09:50.888 --> 00:09:53.288
In our time we used attar

00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:59.807
These foreign perfumes turn my stomach

00:10:01.647 --> 00:10:02.567
I am leaving.

00:10:12.647 --> 00:10:17.367
"Won't you buy my pretty flowers?"

00:10:19.647 --> 00:10:21.128
Are these jackets all new ?

00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:24.807
The talior brought them in today.
All made from my own designs

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:27.887
I know

00:10:29.487 --> 00:10:35.408
But is it right that there should
be only one man to admire them ?

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:38.607
You think I dress for
all the men in the world ?

00:10:40.047 --> 00:10:41.247
Why all the men ?

00:10:42.287 --> 00:10:45.447
I'm thinking of the ones
I've sung your praises to

00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:47.888
You think they're dying to glimpse me ?

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:51.527
Do you know something ?

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:52.847
What?

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:58.247
This seclusion of women
was never a Hindu custom

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:04.727
Draupadi and the great heroines
of our epics were never in purdah

00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:07.647
What of it ? Your Bimala is

00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:15.167
You know about women
choosing their husbands ...

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:17.408
... from their suitors ?

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:21.608
Why laugh ?

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:26.048
If I had the option, I
might not have chosen you

00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:27.488
I know

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:31.328
But you didn't have the option

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.848
How sad

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:38.687
I do envy Draupadi and her five husbands

00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:45.248
And in all your life
you've set eyes on only one man

00:11:45.887 --> 00:11:49.287
How can you know what
kind of man he is ...

00:11:49.364 --> 00:11:51.767
... if you can't
compare him with others ?

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.367
You don't want to bring back
the classical age, do you ?

00:11:58.047 --> 00:12:00.167
Still, I see no logic
behind this seclusion.

00:12:01.916 --> 00:12:04.407
I think it came with the Muslims

00:12:06.217 --> 00:12:08.127
Hindus never insisted on it

00:12:09.447 --> 00:12:12.128
I don't think people will give up
the custom just because you say so

00:12:13.947 --> 00:12:16.328
It's not people I'm thinking of, Bimala

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:20.127
You know I'm not like others

00:12:21.848 --> 00:12:25.647
I don't think conventions
ought to be followed blindly

00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:45.368
If I could persuade you to meet
my friends, I'd feel very proud

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.407
"Friends" meaning him ?

00:12:54.847 --> 00:12:56.807
Sandip is certainly a host in himself

00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:02.061
I have no wish to meet
someone who fleeces you ...

00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:04.511
... on some pretext or other

00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:08.231
Sandip works for the country

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:11.111
He's gifted, but he lacks money

00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:16.071
If my money helps me share his
good deeds, that's to my advantage

00:13:16.551 --> 00:13:18.711
How does he work for the country ?

00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:20.591
Swadeshi

00:13:21.231 --> 00:13:22.431
Do you know the world ?

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:26.591
Of course. They often use it these days

00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:32.231
Boycott foreign goods, buy Swadeshi

00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:35.511
Swadeshi salt, Swadeshi sugar ...

00:13:36.951 --> 00:13:38.271
You know so much ?

00:13:40.232 --> 00:13:41.912
Don't I read the newspaper ?

00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:44.031
Do you know the reason ?

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:45.831
I do

00:13:46.311 --> 00:13:46.991
Tell me.

00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:50.432
Sit here and tell me

00:13:58.072 --> 00:13:59.711
Yes, Mr. School master

00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:02.471
Tell me what's behind Swadeshi

00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:05.951
The Governer-General has split up Bengal

00:14:06.342 --> 00:14:08.792
Hindus and Muslims
lived peacefully together;

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:11.511
he's driven a wedge between them

00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.551
You seem to forget that
your wife has been educated

00:14:20.173 --> 00:14:22.592
I know Enlgish; why
shouldn't I know these facts ?

00:14:24.308 --> 00:14:25.791
Sorry madam, sorry

00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:32.312
Well, Sandip is a leader
of this Swadeshi Movement

00:14:36.351 --> 00:14:39.791
Aren't they the ones who
shout "Hail Motherland !" ?

00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:41.271
Yes.

00:14:42.512 --> 00:14:47.031
"Hail Motherland"

00:14:48.063 --> 00:14:51.392
This one cry has set
the whole nation astir

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.751
But for one person
- he is not stirred

00:15:03.282 --> 00:15:05.871
It takes a lot to stir me, Bimala.

00:15:07.692 --> 00:15:13.271
Although I certainly don't
approve of Lord Curzon's policy

00:15:14.857 --> 00:15:20.351
I think it's villainous to set
Hindus and Muslims against each other

00:15:20.867 --> 00:15:23.067
Don't the Swadeshis
burn foreign clothes ?

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:25.307
They do

00:15:26.347 --> 00:15:28.467
They'll certainly consign
this sari to the flames ...

00:15:28.547 --> 00:15:30.147
... if they lay hands on it

00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:35.347
Do you know where the yarn for
this comes from ? Manchester

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:36.867
Really ?

00:15:38.387 --> 00:15:41.067
Most of the objects on this
dressing-table come from abroad

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:47.227
This brush is foreign ...
the mirror ... the comb ...

00:15:48.575 --> 00:15:50.627
... you hairpins ...

00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:54.587
Those perfumes are from France

00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:59.067
These bottles are foreign cut glass

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:01.867
The table's foreign, too

00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:11.547
Most of the furniture here comes
from Lazarus, a British company

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.627
Really, and we don't give it a thought

00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:21.427
What do you think we should do ?

00:16:23.369 --> 00:16:27.049
Why not ask Sandip ? He is coming here

00:16:27.806 --> 00:16:30.169
Really ? When ?

00:16:30.576 --> 00:16:31.449
Shortly

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:35.729
He'll be my guest. He'll
hold a meeting in our quadrangle

00:16:40.627 --> 00:16:44.289
I think you'll enjoy meeting him

00:16:45.969 --> 00:16:46.569
Why ?

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.329
Something about him appeals to women

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.569
He's had quite a few affairs

00:16:59.369 --> 00:17:02.369
And not all the women were Swadeshi

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.569
But he's not married, is he ?

00:17:06.729 --> 00:17:08.889
He has no time for it, he says

00:17:09.753 --> 00:17:13.169
Domesticity doesn't suit him

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:18.449
He has a restless nature.
Quite my opposite

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.889
Why should I enjoy
meeting your opposite ?

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:28.409
You may not enjoy it, but
you may find it instructive

00:17:29.689 --> 00:17:31.089
I'm happy in my seclusion

00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:33.889
I have no wish to be
like the classical heroines

00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:39.369
I was unprepared for the
incident that followed in a few days

00:17:41.249 --> 00:17:44.929
Such a shock Mr. Choudhury

00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:47.489
Why they do with to me

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:50.209
School Boys did it, Ms. Gilby

00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:56.529
I know the face, they
smile at me, greet me... says

00:17:56.965 --> 00:18:00.689
Good morning madam,
Good morning madam Gilby

00:18:01.987 --> 00:18:06.209
Now say, what's wrong with them

00:18:08.407 --> 00:18:14.369
From the church on the way home I
passed standing outside the grocery shop

00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:18.049
I smiled at their men

00:18:19.118 --> 00:18:21.209
one of the pick up the stone

00:18:21.472 --> 00:18:22.992
I was amazed to hear the woman speak.

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:24.752
It is Sunday today.

00:18:25.232 --> 00:18:26.272
That is why she had
gone to the Church today.

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.512
On her way back..

00:18:28.592 --> 00:18:30.192
..one of the school boys..

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.352
..threw a stone at her..

00:18:32.632 --> 00:18:35.112
..and caused a wound on her head.

00:18:35.536 --> 00:18:37.552
This is the effect of
the nationalist movement.

00:18:38.112 --> 00:18:41.512
The people of the nation have poison
in their mind against the English.

00:18:42.032 --> 00:18:44.952
That is why a helpless
person like Ms. Gilby..

00:18:45.246 --> 00:18:46.236
..is in danger today.

00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:47.032
I could understand..

00:18:47.152 --> 00:18:48.392
..that I couldn't be an
English madam anymore.

00:18:48.832 --> 00:18:50.912
You have been so good to me.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.112
You have been..

00:18:54.192 --> 00:18:55.032
Even you have been.

00:18:56.232 --> 00:18:58.112
Miss Gilby went away

00:18:59.112 --> 00:19:04.072
A few days later the Swadeshis arrived

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:06.693
Hail Motherland !

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.069
Hail Motherland !

00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:14.752
There he is. Those boys are
bearing him on their shoulders

00:19:15.578 --> 00:19:17.538
Hail Motherland !

00:19:17.618 --> 00:19:19.138
Hail Motherland !

00:19:19.218 --> 00:19:21.178
Hail Motherland !

00:19:21.378 --> 00:19:22.738
Hail Motherland !

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.858
Hail Motherland !

00:19:24.938 --> 00:19:26.418
Hail Motherland !

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.381
Hail Motherland !

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:29.812
Hail Motherland !

00:19:29.889 --> 00:19:31.818
Hail Motherland !

00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:33.498
Hail Motherland !

00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:35.581
Hail Motherland !

00:19:35.658 --> 00:19:36.900
Hail Motherland !

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:39.218
Hail Motherland !

00:19:43.498 --> 00:19:44.738
Friends !

00:19:45.658 --> 00:19:51.098
You all know why we're
assembled here tonight.

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:58.378
A grave crisis has
shattered the peace of Bengal

00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:04.258
Lord Curzon, with one stroke
of his diplomatic sword ...

00:20:04.778 --> 00:20:07.418
... has severed Bengal in two

00:20:08.418 --> 00:20:10.258
The spirit of solidarity ...

00:20:10.658 --> 00:20:15.778
... which had bound the
two religious groups ...

00:20:16.034 --> 00:20:20.901
... in the east and west of Bengal ...

00:20:20.978 --> 00:20:28.138
... had become a source of
grave concern to our rulers

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.138
The split has cut at the
very roots of this solidarity

00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:37.458
Now we all know what the
policy of our rulers is :

00:20:37.658 --> 00:20:43.098
divide and rule, to bring about a
rift between the two communities ...

00:20:43.356 --> 00:20:46.658
... and thereby
strengthen their own hands

00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:49.092
The power of our British rulers ...

00:20:49.253 --> 00:20:50.772
... is matched by their arrogance

00:20:51.173 --> 00:20:54.773
The political leaders of Bengal ...

00:20:55.013 --> 00:20:57.612
... rose as one man
against the Partition

00:20:57.852 --> 00:21:00.413
But our rulers paid no heed to them.

00:21:00.812 --> 00:21:05.412
We lacked the means to prevent our
rulers from carrying out their design

00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:09.212
But our rulers failed to realize that
we can meet diplomacy with diplomacy

00:21:09.612 --> 00:21:14.573
Our strategy will not
only confound our rulers

00:21:14.813 --> 00:21:18.413
It will ultimately bring
prosperity and help our people ...

00:21:18.492 --> 00:21:20.772
... stand on their own feet

00:21:21.092 --> 00:21:23.612
This is the practice of Swadeshi

00:21:24.372 --> 00:21:30.852
I call upon all of you: men
and women, rich and poor ...

00:21:30.932 --> 00:21:37.452
... rulers and subjects
- take the solemn vow

00:21:37.532 --> 00:21:41.453
Boycott all foreign goods ...

00:21:41.532 --> 00:21:45.173
... and open your arms to Swadeshi

00:21:46.052 --> 00:21:50.831
Our rulers have so far
thwarted all our efforts ...

00:21:51.104 --> 00:21:52.572
... to develop our resources

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.829
We have been forced to
buy foreign cloth, ...

00:21:56.906 --> 00:21:58.853
... foreign salt, foreign sugar

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.012
Have you ever
considered how many articles ...

00:22:03.092 --> 00:22:04.973
... in daily use are made here ?

00:22:05.453 --> 00:22:09.500
I don't know if you've seen the
big foreign stores in Calcutta.

00:22:09.577 --> 00:22:10.532
I have

00:22:10.749 --> 00:22:15.893
Their profusion of goods and the
prosperity they enjoy is staggering

00:22:16.052 --> 00:22:18.092
Haven't we the right to ask ...

00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:22.155
... why our wealth should fill
the coffers of our foreign rulers ?

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:25.052
Who has given them this
right of exploitation ?

00:22:25.253 --> 00:22:30.972
Is this not at the root of our poverty ?

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:34.613
Is it not our duty to put
and end to this extortion ?

00:22:35.047 --> 00:22:38.538
Has not the time come
to wipe out this shame ?

00:22:38.627 --> 00:22:41.987
If we remain indifferent, if
this robbery continues ...

00:22:42.147 --> 00:22:44.747
... what kind of future can
we expect for our country ?

00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:50.747
So I say : the time for action has come

00:22:51.067 --> 00:22:56.627
Let us all take the
solemn vow of Swadeshi

00:22:56.982 --> 00:23:00.987
And the great cry from the heart
that will launch us on this task

00:23:01.186 --> 00:23:05.378
The sacred-mantra that will
rock the throne of our rulers

00:23:05.589 --> 00:23:11.147
Come, let us all chant that
mantra and, braving all peril,

00:23:11.227 --> 00:23:15.481
... dedicate ourselves to the
service of the Mother land !

00:23:15.621 --> 00:23:17.359
Hail Motherland !

00:23:17.436 --> 00:23:19.252
Hail Motherland !

00:23:19.329 --> 00:23:21.066
Hail Motherland !

00:23:21.143 --> 00:23:23.627
Hail Motherland !

00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:32.507
Tell me the tale that to me was a dear

00:23:32.907 --> 00:23:38.907
Long long ago... Long ago...

00:23:39.829 --> 00:23:44.352
Tell me the tale that to me was a dear

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:48.227
Still singing English songs after
that impassioned nationalist speech ?

00:23:49.783 --> 00:23:51.182
What should I sing, then ?

00:23:53.302 --> 00:23:58.102
Kirtans, songs about
the Lord Krishna ...

00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:09.703
'Gentle she walks, The Beauteous One'

00:24:10.063 --> 00:24:14.863
'Radiant as the moon The Beauteous One'

00:24:15.422 --> 00:24:20.942
'It goes away.'

00:24:22.063 --> 00:24:23.383
That's better

00:24:25.142 --> 00:24:28.822
I must say, he speaks
well; the way he turns phrases

00:24:29.182 --> 00:24:31.222
He was good at debate in college

00:24:32.422 --> 00:24:38.182
'Her smile sends ripples of delight'

00:24:38.942 --> 00:24:41.102
The boys in saffron
made a pretty picture

00:24:46.942 --> 00:24:51.343
That makes the Love-God swoon

00:24:56.023 --> 00:24:57.182
How long will he stay ?

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.302
He'll go to Rongpur tomorrow

00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:05.263
He'll work from there

00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:08.302
Do you want to meet him ?

00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:12.964
What's the use ?
I'll have nothing to say

00:25:14.044 --> 00:25:17.604
Say nothing. He'll do all the talking

00:25:48.844 --> 00:25:50.724
Suppose he asks me about Swadeshi ?

00:25:51.941 --> 00:25:53.044
Tell him what you think

00:25:54.948 --> 00:25:57.684
He certainly seemed to make sense

00:25:59.563 --> 00:26:00.643
Tell him so

00:26:02.283 --> 00:26:05.244
I'm sure he'll be shocked if I
wear one of my fancy jackets

00:26:08.884 --> 00:26:10.324
What do you think I should wear ?

00:26:23.923 --> 00:26:26.964
On the 15th of November, 1907
the young mistress of the house...

00:26:27.804 --> 00:26:30.844
... of the Choudhurys
defied convention ...

00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:33.124
... a trod the passage
to the outer apartments

00:27:34.724 --> 00:27:36.204
Greeting

00:27:41.513 --> 00:27:45.993
Your speech has inspired my wife
to take up the cause of Swadeshi

00:27:47.193 --> 00:27:48.473
You must be joking

00:27:49.153 --> 00:27:50.353
It's the truth

00:27:51.993 --> 00:27:52.793
Come with me.

00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:54.953
Sit down.

00:27:57.273 --> 00:27:58.393
Sit down, Sandip

00:28:01.473 --> 00:28:02.153
What happened?

00:28:02.393 --> 00:28:03.193
Sit down.

00:28:12.313 --> 00:28:17.033
At first I couldn't believe my eyes

00:28:19.033 --> 00:28:21.153
Now I can't believe my ears

00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:23.873
My husband is exaggerating

00:28:24.913 --> 00:28:28.513
Even if only a fraction is true,
I'll be more than happy

00:28:29.873 --> 00:28:31.873
Whatever I may
accomplish as a politician ...

00:28:32.396 --> 00:28:35.596
... you have already
achieved a social revolution

00:28:36.476 --> 00:28:39.996
And I know what that means

00:28:40.076 --> 00:28:45.076
I also realize that you're
no mere shadow of your husband

00:28:45.418 --> 00:28:47.116
You have a mind of you own

00:28:48.676 --> 00:28:52.276
Nikhil never takes me seriously.

00:28:52.716 --> 00:28:55.596
Go on like that and
she'll be walking on air

00:28:55.676 --> 00:28:57.756
You can't stop me

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:02.396
As a politician I'm brazen
about seeking support for my cause

00:29:04.116 --> 00:29:06.956
I haven't yet succeeded
in persuading a woman ...

00:29:07.836 --> 00:29:14.436
... but should that ever happen,
I'd be delighted

00:29:16.116 --> 00:29:22.756
Women have this rare
quality of intuition

00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:26.196
I admire it greatly

00:29:27.236 --> 00:29:30.436
Man's powers of reasoning pale beside it

00:29:31.876 --> 00:29:33.076
What do you say, Nikhil ?

00:29:35.556 --> 00:29:38.836
Tell him what you thought of his speech

00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:40.196
Oh yes.

00:29:41.436 --> 00:29:43.476
I was going to ask you

00:29:44.837 --> 00:29:45.676
Tell me.

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:51.076
Did it sound like drivel to you ?

00:29:52.476 --> 00:29:53.916
Come on, don't hesitate

00:29:55.076 --> 00:29:56.996
I haven't had much time to think

00:29:57.076 --> 00:29:58.956
That's precisely why I'm asking you

00:29:59.556 --> 00:30:03.996
Thinking is for him; you tell
me what comes from your heart

00:30:04.396 --> 00:30:05.796
Forget about making
sense when you speak.

00:30:07.876 --> 00:30:12.920
I fell that if the British have
done wrong to split up Bengal ...

00:30:12.996 --> 00:30:18.396
... then we should not let it pass

00:30:19.625 --> 00:30:23.756
If Swadeshi can shake them
a bit, then we should do it

00:30:23.836 --> 00:30:25.756
Yes, yes.

00:30:27.056 --> 00:30:30.716
Of course, it won't help if only
a few people take up the cause

00:30:31.567 --> 00:30:36.356
But if the whole country wakes
up to it, then we may succeed

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.860
Absolutely.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.380
Bravo ! That is exactly what we aim at

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.700
That is what our battle-cry
is for : Hail Motherland !

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.700
Awaken the nation. Isn't
there magic in those two words ?

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.140
Have you tried them ?

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.460
Please do.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.863
You need not raise
your voice; softly will do

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.700
As a matter of fact, when
all of you gave that cry,

00:31:06.321 --> 00:31:07.620
I felt a ...

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.380
Thrill ?

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.900
A shiver down the spine

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.340
That's as it should be

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.180
Do you know, your husband does
not believe in our battle-cry ?

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.660
What do you say, Nikhil?

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.620
I don't believe in artificial stimulants

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.940
Artificial stimulants ?

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.100
If you want people who've
never thought before ...

00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:33.020
... about their country's problems ...

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.140
... how can you do
without artificial stimulants ?

00:31:35.684 --> 00:31:39.500
But the work comes first, Nikhil

00:31:40.168 --> 00:31:44.900
And the battle-cry
provides the incentive to work

00:31:45.181 --> 00:31:47.580
Don't you know how the
Marseillaise stirred ...

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.280
... the French revolutionaries ?

00:31:49.422 --> 00:31:54.061
What we need most today is
to rouse the people to action

00:31:54.822 --> 00:31:59.461
Our poets write Swadeshi
songs to inspire the people.

00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:00.942
Do you know any ?

00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:09.385
"You will break bonds of rules."

00:32:09.462 --> 00:32:12.861
'You think you are
strong enough to break ...

00:32:12.938 --> 00:32:15.942
... the bonds that destiny has tied ?'

00:32:16.021 --> 00:32:24.141
"You think you can make or
break us according to your will ?"

00:32:24.222 --> 00:32:26.541
"You think you can
break the bond of destiny."

00:32:26.622 --> 00:32:28.941
"You think you are so powerful."

00:32:29.022 --> 00:32:33.822
"You think you are so powerful."

00:32:33.901 --> 00:32:38.665
'You think you can make or
break us. You have this pride."

00:32:38.742 --> 00:32:41.502
"You think you can
break the bond of destiny."

00:32:41.581 --> 00:32:43.782
"You think you can
pull us back forever."

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:46.221
"And keep us under you."

00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:48.582
"You think you can
pull us back forever."

00:32:48.661 --> 00:32:50.941
"And keep us under you."

00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:53.382
"You don't have the strength."

00:32:53.461 --> 00:32:55.461
"You don't have the strength."

00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:57.825
"We will not accept those rules."

00:32:57.901 --> 00:33:01.861
"You think you can
break the bond of destiny."

00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:04.981
"You think you are so powerful."

00:33:05.394 --> 00:33:07.821
"You may burden us with constraints."

00:33:07.902 --> 00:33:10.055
"But there's one mightier than you"

00:33:10.132 --> 00:33:12.582
"You may burden us with constraints."

00:33:12.661 --> 00:33:14.862
"But there's one mightier than you"

00:33:15.021 --> 00:33:19.341
"You may pride yourself on you might."

00:33:19.422 --> 00:33:22.101
"But even the weak can summon strength"

00:33:22.182 --> 00:33:26.821
"Rob us of our strength.
and you dig your own grave"

00:33:26.941 --> 00:33:31.581
"Rob us of our strength.
and you dig your own grave"

00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:38.541
"Your boat will surely sink
under the weight of your own quilt"

00:33:38.622 --> 00:33:42.621
"You think you can
break the bond of destiny."

00:33:42.702 --> 00:33:44.986
"You think you are so powerful."

00:33:45.062 --> 00:33:48.261
'You think you can make or
break us. You have this pride."

00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:53.102
"You think you can
break the bond of destiny."

00:33:53.192 --> 00:33:57.192
"You think you can
break the bond of destiny."

00:33:57.272 --> 00:34:00.752
"You think you are so powerful."

00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:01.431
Wow.

00:34:02.352 --> 00:34:04.592
I grant that it's an admirable song

00:34:06.032 --> 00:34:06.831
Oh my God.

00:34:07.352 --> 00:34:08.391
What's all this ?

00:34:08.472 --> 00:34:11.031
Swadeshi tea: Darjeeling

00:34:11.352 --> 00:34:13.832
But there's a lot more than just tea

00:34:14.312 --> 00:34:17.952
You must have some sweets, too

00:34:18.247 --> 00:34:21.792
And they're not only Swadeshi,
Bimala made them herself

00:34:21.872 --> 00:34:25.392
Then I have to taste one

00:34:26.672 --> 00:34:29.511
I haven't yet got over
my weakness for sweets

00:34:30.072 --> 00:34:32.432
Nor for foreign cigarettes, I can see

00:34:32.592 --> 00:34:37.392
Out of the question ! Do you
know the Swadeshi brands ?

00:34:37.832 --> 00:34:39.312
Unthinkable !

00:34:39.392 --> 00:34:40.911
Can't you give up smoking ?

00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:41.952
Smoking?

00:34:43.152 --> 00:34:44.592
Haven't you the will-power ?

00:34:50.552 --> 00:34:51.152
Okay.

00:34:51.633 --> 00:34:53.511
You join our party and I'll stop smoking

00:34:54.764 --> 00:34:55.911
Sugar?

00:34:56.391 --> 00:34:58.392
One if it's foreign two if it's Swadeshi

00:35:07.392 --> 00:35:11.031
What are your plans now?

00:35:12.516 --> 00:35:18.116
Your neighbour land owner
Harish Kundu, has sent word

00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:23.516
They'll have a
bonfire of foreign clothes

00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:27.596
He wants me to conduct
the ritual, so I must go

00:35:30.933 --> 00:35:36.437
Do you know that for me the one
stumbling block is your husband?

00:35:36.516 --> 00:35:37.997
He refuses to help the cause

00:35:39.876 --> 00:35:42.917
You'll find many landed gentry
around here to help the cause

00:35:44.856 --> 00:35:47.556
Why not leave my estate alone?

00:35:47.916 --> 00:35:52.596
You see, not a shred
of patriotism in him!

00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:58.196
Anyway.

00:35:59.876 --> 00:36:00.677
So tell me.

00:36:03.097 --> 00:36:04.556
Are you joining our party or not?

00:36:05.717 --> 00:36:09.036
Don't worry, you don't have
to sign a pledge or anything

00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:12.077
You'll stay exactly as you are

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.837
I'll come to you in case of need

00:36:16.196 --> 00:36:16.997
What is it? Tell me.

00:36:17.996 --> 00:36:20.357
Well? Yes or no?

00:36:22.116 --> 00:36:23.036
All right

00:36:23.316 --> 00:36:24.036
Good.

00:36:24.437 --> 00:36:25.517
Well, I must go now

00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:27.836
Must you?

00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:31.956
There's work to do; my
boys are waiting downstairs

00:36:33.236 --> 00:36:37.757
Mrs. Choudhury, this is
truly a memorable day for me

00:36:38.636 --> 00:36:42.901
Only one request; trust your intuition

00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:45.036
- Don't let this gentleman guide you

00:36:45.797 --> 00:36:48.077
Don't worry, Sahib

00:36:49.196 --> 00:36:52.556
From now on, my wife is a free agent

00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:54.596
Splendid

00:36:54.756 --> 00:36:56.636
Okay. Shall I leave?

00:36:57.416 --> 00:36:59.396
I'll come along with you

00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:46.037
Hail Motherland !

00:37:46.116 --> 00:37:47.837
Hail Motherland !

00:37:47.916 --> 00:37:49.596
Hail Motherland !

00:37:49.676 --> 00:37:51.276
Hail Motherland !

00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:53.196
Hail Motherland !

00:37:53.276 --> 00:37:54.716
Hail Motherland !

00:37:55.015 --> 00:37:56.396
Hail Motherland !

00:37:56.477 --> 00:37:58.040
Hail Motherland !

00:37:58.116 --> 00:37:59.756
Hail Motherland !

00:38:00.036 --> 00:38:01.637
Hail Motherland!

00:38:01.716 --> 00:38:03.396
Hail Motherland !

00:38:03.476 --> 00:38:05.316
Hail Motherland !

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.036
You haven't told me yet

00:38:11.196 --> 00:38:11.957
What?

00:38:13.196 --> 00:38:15.317
What you thought of my friend

00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:18.677
But we've only met once

00:38:19.915 --> 00:38:21.396
I think the less one knows

00:38:22.435 --> 00:38:24.996
Sandip, the better one likes him

00:38:25.915 --> 00:38:28.435
You seem to have so little in common;

00:38:29.155 --> 00:38:32.035
I wonder how you ever became friends

00:38:34.836 --> 00:38:36.595
That's not unusual, Bimala

00:38:38.596 --> 00:38:42.436
Friendships are not
worked out mathematically

00:38:44.431 --> 00:38:47.356
We've been friends since college

00:38:49.036 --> 00:38:51.036
It's not that we had nothing in common

00:38:52.795 --> 00:38:59.236
We both decided to have nothing
to do with irrational conventions

00:39:00.396 --> 00:39:04.476
He was even more radical than I

00:39:07.036 --> 00:39:09.115
When his parents
arranged a bride for him...

00:39:10.075 --> 00:39:13.756
...he was so annoyed he
severed all ties with them

00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:23.916
Soon after we were married he
asked to be introduced to you

00:39:26.515 --> 00:39:29.196
He would remind me from time to time

00:39:31.671 --> 00:39:33.198
Finally he said:

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:37.116
" I don't word of what
you say about your wife"

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.076
And do you know what he said today

00:39:45.196 --> 00:39:45.796
What?

00:39:52.795 --> 00:39:55.036
I shall not tell you
- Why not?

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.115
What can he say after
such a brief meeting?

00:40:01.506 --> 00:40:03.876
I can say a lot more

00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:06.756
But you never do

00:40:08.977 --> 00:40:14.137
Do I have to? Don't
you have your intuition?

00:40:53.776 --> 00:40:55.057
Madam

00:40:55.537 --> 00:40:56.536
What is it?

00:40:56.656 --> 00:40:58.696
A letter from Mr. Mukherji

00:41:07.777 --> 00:41:12.736
I hope the rule was
not broken for just a day

00:41:12.976 --> 00:41:15.777
Can I see you for a moment?

00:41:16.617 --> 00:41:18.097
Tell him I'm coming

00:41:18.177 --> 00:41:19.177
Okay.

00:41:23.457 --> 00:41:27.376
When Krishna's flute
beckons so, I must go

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:18.736
Hail Motherland!

00:42:20.522 --> 00:42:21.842
My husband's not in

00:42:22.642 --> 00:42:25.601
I did not ask for him, I asked for you

00:42:26.522 --> 00:42:27.602
Won't you sit down?

00:42:34.162 --> 00:42:35.681
You have eluded me for years;

00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:38.201
..you mustn't keep your distance now

00:42:39.521 --> 00:42:42.002
Sit beside me

00:42:48.729 --> 00:42:50.321
That's it

00:43:07.042 --> 00:43:08.242
What's the matter?

00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:12.322
I can't believe it

00:43:13.922 --> 00:43:18.242
Ever since you married, Nikhil has
said he would introduce me to you

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:20.441
I didn't believe him

00:43:21.456 --> 00:43:23.976
Even now I find it hard to believe

00:43:25.456 --> 00:43:27.936
Until now I've only heard
of your many accomplishments

00:43:28.536 --> 00:43:31.500
You've learnt English from a memsahib

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:34.976
You love books, needlework, cooking

00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:41.176
I even know your favourite dishes,
what flowers you like...

00:43:43.653 --> 00:43:45.416
I also know something else

00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:49.536
You resent the fact...

00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:51.816
...that I borrow money from Nikhil

00:43:53.416 --> 00:43:55.256
So you really are no stranger to me

00:43:56.336 --> 00:43:59.096
But I never imagined I'd
one day find myself....

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.440
...sitting by your side

00:44:05.659 --> 00:44:08.360
Did you go to Rongpur?
- I did

00:44:09.036 --> 00:44:11.080
How was the trip? -Splendid

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.920
That's why the first thing I
wanted this morning was to see you

00:44:16.795 --> 00:44:18.440
Don't you have to go again?

00:44:18.997 --> 00:44:19.800
Where?

00:44:19.976 --> 00:44:23.320
Rongpur. Isn't that your base?

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.840
That was the idea, but not any more

00:44:29.009 --> 00:44:29.560
No?

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.560
Let me tell you frankly,

00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:37.240
I want to be near you when I work

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.160
Like the worker bee
working for the queen;

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.760
.. you'll be Queen Bee

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.440
Do you mind?

00:44:52.599 --> 00:44:56.200
But won't you find it inconvenient here?

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.920
That's true

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.240
Nikhil will not approve, I think

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.920
But the thing is...

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.120
I have in me...

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.080
...a stubborn streak

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.480
I can't accept Nikhil's attitude at all

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.680
I want to spread the
cause of Swadeshi right here

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.080
And I want your help

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.440
But I really know
nothing about your work

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.520
I know that you make
speeches Is that all?

00:45:54.760 --> 00:46:00.080
That's one of the main
things; persuasion can work wonders

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.960
Wait.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.400
If you really want to know
about our work, read this

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:12.400
You will know
everything when you read this.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.080
"Our Struggle"

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.640
I'll certainly read it

00:46:21.668 --> 00:46:23.600
May I tell you something now?

00:46:25.177 --> 00:46:29.057
One of the biggest markets in
this area is here, in Suksayar

00:46:30.097 --> 00:46:31.378
So I've heard

00:46:31.897 --> 00:46:34.018
It's the only market in the district

00:46:34.537 --> 00:46:36.817
..where foreign goods
are still being sold

00:46:37.657 --> 00:46:41.017
Elsewhere the landowners
have stopped their sale

00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:42.658
But Nikhil hasn't done so

00:46:44.057 --> 00:46:46.138
I'll do my best to right that...

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:50.657
...but with your help my
task would be much easier

00:46:51.457 --> 00:46:54.898
I'm afraid you
over-estimate my capabilities

00:46:55.099 --> 00:46:56.017
Not at all

00:46:57.617 --> 00:47:01.217
Nikhil may be my friend,
but he's your husband

00:47:01.858 --> 00:47:04.018
You have much more hold on him

00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:07.697
My husband is not easily swayed

00:47:08.698 --> 00:47:13.217
I know, but I think he'll listen to you

00:47:18.017 --> 00:47:20.698
I know how much you mean to him

00:47:21.977 --> 00:47:23.417
Will you try just once to persuade him?

00:47:26.857 --> 00:47:29.497
Nikhil's tenants would not
dare go against his will

00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:32.938
He has only to tell them not to
bring foreign goods into the market

00:47:34.337 --> 00:47:36.017
And if I fail to persuade him?

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.137
I'd be happy if you only tried

00:47:40.574 --> 00:47:42.257
If you fail, I'll use other means

00:47:43.498 --> 00:47:45.538
Not without Queen
Bee's knowledge, of course

00:47:46.937 --> 00:47:49.138
Can I depend on you?

00:47:50.536 --> 00:47:51.778
I'll try

00:47:59.537 --> 00:48:00.977
The more I see you...

00:48:01.697 --> 00:48:03.857
...the more I'm filled with admiration

00:48:15.178 --> 00:48:16.138
I think I'll...

00:48:17.137 --> 00:48:18.977
You may go now

00:48:23.269 --> 00:48:24.257
Listen.

00:48:26.886 --> 00:48:28.457
There's something...

00:48:35.423 --> 00:48:39.983
This is one foreign
object which I shall keep

00:48:45.143 --> 00:48:47.103
Did you see Sandip today

00:48:48.623 --> 00:48:49.583
Yes

00:48:52.775 --> 00:48:53.863
How is he doing?

00:48:55.663 --> 00:48:57.343
He's worried

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:58.303
Why?

00:49:00.623 --> 00:49:02.543
You don't take kindly to his Swadeshi

00:49:03.223 --> 00:49:04.583
Nonsense

00:49:05.063 --> 00:49:08.103
He's free to work for his cause...

00:49:08.743 --> 00:49:10.223
..as long as he leaves my estate alone

00:49:12.223 --> 00:49:14.183
He says he'll stay here

00:49:15.783 --> 00:49:16.783
Stay here?

00:49:18.223 --> 00:49:21.863
That's what he says;
stay here and work here

00:49:24.783 --> 00:49:26.063
That wouldn't be right

00:49:27.903 --> 00:49:31.023
But everyone has taken up
Swadeshi; why can't you?

00:49:31.983 --> 00:49:36.943
That notion would mean throwing
all foreign goods out of the market

00:49:37.967 --> 00:49:40.663
Harish Kundu can do that I can't

00:49:41.503 --> 00:49:43.783
Surely the market belongs to you

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.743
No, Bimala, the market
belongs to the traders;

00:49:48.823 --> 00:49:51.143
.. they're people of small means

00:49:53.283 --> 00:49:57.743
Foreign goods are
cheaper and of better quality

00:50:00.072 --> 00:50:02.063
Naturally, the poor prefer to buy them.

00:50:02.383 --> 00:50:04.143
How can I force them not to?

00:50:06.712 --> 00:50:12.143
Swadeshi is for those who can afford it

00:50:17.371 --> 00:50:18.423
What are you thinking?

00:50:19.834 --> 00:50:21.343
Can't we have...

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:26.927
...Swadeshi so that
the poor don't suffer?

00:50:28.171 --> 00:50:31.247
If we could, I'd certainly support it

00:50:32.487 --> 00:50:34.767
You think the very
idea of Swadeshi is wrong?

00:50:36.127 --> 00:50:40.727
Even if I do think it is wrong,
who will listen to me?

00:50:41.868 --> 00:50:43.967
You yourself felt that Sandip was right;

00:50:44.443 --> 00:50:46.207
...many others will feel the same

00:50:48.327 --> 00:50:54.167
But I believe that coercing the
poor can only harm the country

00:51:00.647 --> 00:51:02.527
I can see you're not convinced

00:51:03.967 --> 00:51:05.767
I was looking at it differently;

00:51:06.607 --> 00:51:09.487
I felt something had to be done

00:51:10.178 --> 00:51:13.887
Even if it meant hardship for the
poor now, it'll help in the long run

00:51:14.715 --> 00:51:17.447
Swadeshis do care for their country

00:51:18.978 --> 00:51:24.687
I believe that what they care for
is an abstract image of the country

00:51:25.196 --> 00:51:27.247
The country as the Mother Goddess

00:51:28.447 --> 00:51:29.767
Worship the Mother,

00:51:30.255 --> 00:51:34.847
...work for the Mother
dedicate your life to her sorrows

00:51:35.989 --> 00:51:40.949
I know the notion is
bound to appeal to women

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:47.149
I know very well how you feel

00:51:48.149 --> 00:51:52.589
But I can't feel the same way

00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:20.469
What you were saying tonight
were they your own thoughts?

00:52:20.853 --> 00:52:22.389
Why this question?

00:52:23.149 --> 00:52:23.829
No.

00:52:24.989 --> 00:52:27.709
I felt you were speaking for Sandip

00:52:27.989 --> 00:52:30.589
Sandip is your friend, not mine

00:52:32.389 --> 00:52:36.909
I thought you had teamed up in
right earnest to work for the cause

00:52:38.149 --> 00:52:41.429
He working in public,
you on the domestic front

00:52:41.509 --> 00:52:42.709
What an idea!

00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:52.549
Will you have daily meetings?

00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:55.429
After pressing me to meet your friend,

00:52:55.509 --> 00:52:57.829
..you can spare me the insinuations

00:53:08.869 --> 00:53:09.869
Sorry, Bimala.

00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:15.709
I asked a simple question,
Bimala; I didn't insinuate anything

00:53:15.909 --> 00:53:19.149
Very well, if it upsets you so much,
I shall not go outside

00:53:20.709 --> 00:53:24.109
You're making a mistake
Why should I be upset?

00:53:25.273 --> 00:53:30.607
After all, I know you both so well,
and why shouldn't you go out?

00:53:30.684 --> 00:53:32.469
Because I don't want to

00:53:33.822 --> 00:53:35.341
You're being unreasonable

00:53:35.422 --> 00:53:38.302
I've been out twice; I
don't have to go out every day

00:53:41.489 --> 00:53:42.582
Very well

00:53:52.782 --> 00:53:54.822
I don't mind if you go or don't go.

00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:57.222
I shall not force you

00:53:59.022 --> 00:54:03.142
I've told you you're
free to do as you please

00:54:04.734 --> 00:54:08.221
But I must tell you one thing

00:54:10.662 --> 00:54:14.382
If you say you'll give up
wearing foreign clothes...

00:54:15.262 --> 00:54:19.422
...or do without your perfumes,
your shoes, your soap...

00:54:20.302 --> 00:54:24.622
...I won't mind at all

00:54:26.622 --> 00:54:29.262
But clamping down on poor traders..

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:32.749
..means abandoning a
principle I hold dear

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:35.470
That I can never do

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.469
Swadeshi is something
I can't take lightly

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.349
The weak say:

00:54:54.790 --> 00:55:00.109
that which has
fallen to my share is mine

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.310
And the impotent assent, but
the lesson of experience is;

00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:05.269
only that which I can
snatch away by force is mine

00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:10.390
My country is not mine
simply because I was born here

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:14.749
It becomes mine only when I
am able to win it by force

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.750
The funeral pyre
celebrates the last rites...

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:27.390
...of foreign commerce in your village

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:29.869
These ashes are sacred

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.310
Hail Motherland!

00:55:32.389 --> 00:55:34.510
Hail Motherland !

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:36.150
Hail Motherland !

00:55:36.229 --> 00:55:38.550
Hail Motherland !

00:55:46.892 --> 00:55:52.270
An urgent matter. Touching the cause

00:56:02.989 --> 00:56:04.669
Please give this to Mrs. Choudhury

00:56:05.142 --> 00:56:06.150
Okay.

00:56:46.819 --> 00:56:48.780
Madam is unwell, Sir

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.420
I see

00:57:05.899 --> 00:57:07.819
You know the Headmaster, don't you?

00:57:09.139 --> 00:57:11.740
Good morning. I hope you are well

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.940
Not while you're about

00:57:19.446 --> 00:57:20.500
How is that?

00:57:21.134 --> 00:57:24.060
His students have
disappeared since you arrived

00:57:25.827 --> 00:57:31.459
But you must admit that to work for
one's country helps to shape character

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:39.190
One of my students hit Mrs.
Choudhury's governess,

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:41.350
Miss Gilby, with a stone

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.550
Does that, too, come
under shaping character?

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:51.230
But that was before I came
here; you can't blame me for that

00:57:51.554 --> 00:57:54.830
And you must admit that
such stray incidents...

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.950
...are inevitable in times of upheaval

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:02.350
You've roped in my
best student, haven't you?

00:58:02.529 --> 00:58:03.485
Who?

00:58:03.562 --> 00:58:04.710
Amulya? - Yes.

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:09.270
He'd have won a
scholarship if he'd sat his exam.

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:11.190
You prevented him

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:14.590
Amulya? I didn't rope him in,
he joined of his own accord

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:22.030
And what about our rowdies and
shirkers? They've joined, too

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:24.910
They're not shirkers any more, sir;

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:27.230
..they're working for the cause

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:31.670
With two exceptions, everyone
here is working for the cause

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:37.910
The exceptions are you
and your ex-student Nikhil

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:41.430
I regret that I
couldn't persuade him to join

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:44.190
Like you, he turns a
deaf ear to Swadeshi

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:50.790
No, only to your brand
of destructive Swadeshi

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:53.990
He practiced Swadeshi
long before your time

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:59.270
And he needed no battle-cries
to bolster him. You know nothing

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:01.710
Do you know of his Swadeshi bank?

00:59:01.892 --> 00:59:04.870
Of his sugar factory, his soap factory?

00:59:05.255 --> 00:59:09.910
Do you know he set up his own
looms for weaving Swadeshi cloth?

00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:15.390
Where were you and your
Hail Motherland! then?

00:59:15.983 --> 00:59:18.347
Do you know how much he
spent on his Swadeshi?

00:59:18.628 --> 00:59:20.028
Do you know something?
- It is okay, sir.

00:59:20.104 --> 00:59:22.750
You stay out of this!
These things must be told

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:27.470
But that's just what I tell him;
if you and I have the same aim...

00:59:27.547 --> 00:59:29.341
...why not join us?

00:59:29.418 --> 00:59:32.670
It's no the same aim at all

00:59:33.238 --> 00:59:37.396
You aim to be self-seeking leaders;

00:59:37.551 --> 00:59:39.150
you don't think of the people at all

00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:41.981
Nikhil's devotion was selfless

00:59:42.461 --> 00:59:46.581
You are being feted

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.380
Nikhil was ridiculed

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:54.660
he had no head for business,
so his Swadeshi didn't last

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:58.821
But his was the right way Yours is wrong

00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:02.340
It's more than wrong; it's harmful

01:00:02.861 --> 01:00:03.581
Dangerous.

01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:05.820
Give it to me.

01:00:07.901 --> 01:00:09.621
I'll drop by in the evening

01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:15.461
Oh my God.

01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:25.181
I implore you, Nikhil, keep
that headmaster out of my way

01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:27.821
I've come here to make speeches

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.421
...not to suffer them

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:33.341
I believe you're
planning to stay here and work

01:00:39.946 --> 01:00:43.620
I'm going to speak in
your market this afternoon

01:00:45.686 --> 01:00:47.340
That's where the challenge is

01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:53.820
Not where the land owner
himself supports Swadeshi

01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:56.820
Not there.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:02.340
But remember: most of my
tenants are poor muslims

01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:08.580
I don't want them to be harassed

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.261
If I see that happening, I
will be forced to intervene

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.540
If they prove to be stubborn,
I shall have to take measures

01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:24.611
many Muslims have accepted Swadeshi

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.291
They've been compelled to...

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:29.691
It'll happen here

01:01:33.771 --> 01:01:39.810
I've said what had to.
What you do now is up to you

01:01:46.382 --> 01:01:50.462
You all know that the
British have by law ...

01:01:50.942 --> 01:01:54.382
... divided Bengal into two

01:01:55.222 --> 01:02:01.782
This amounts to erecting a
wall between Hindus and Muslims

01:02:02.662 --> 01:02:07.702
They have not given us the
right to break this wall

01:02:08.063 --> 01:02:11.982
But to foil the government we
have chosen a different path

01:02:12.368 --> 01:02:14.622
One important way ...

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:20.142
... is to stop selling
foreign goods in our markets

01:02:20.702 --> 01:02:26.142
The things you sell : salt, sugar,
cloth, articles of daily use ...

01:02:26.222 --> 01:02:29.422
... are all foreign products

01:02:30.126 --> 01:02:37.343
Because you sell them,
foreigners grow rich ...

01:02:37.663 --> 01:02:41.662
... and Indians become poor

01:02:42.262 --> 01:02:44.382
This is wrong, it must not go on

01:02:44.902 --> 01:02:48.302
So far we have
tolerated this, but no more

01:02:48.782 --> 01:02:54.262
Indian substitutes for foreign
goods are not always available

01:02:54.822 --> 01:02:58.942
So you have had to
trade in what there is

01:02:59.462 --> 01:03:06.102
If we make sacrifices and
produce Indian goods ...

01:03:06.502 --> 01:03:09.942
... we shall overcome these difficulties

01:03:10.342 --> 01:03:13.582
Friends, come forward ...

01:03:14.222 --> 01:03:18.822
... so that we may avoid the
division of Bengal and we may regain ...

01:03:19.022 --> 01:03:20.902
... our self-esteem

01:03:21.822 --> 01:03:26.102
See this circle before me

01:03:26.262 --> 01:03:31.302
Throw your foreign goods
into the circle of flags

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:35.262
Indian substitutes will be made

01:03:35.822 --> 01:03:38.782
Manufacturers have come forward

01:03:39.302 --> 01:03:42.462
Do not fear of losing your livelihood

01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:46.262
Today's loss will not be lost for ever

01:03:46.763 --> 01:03:50.582
Get rid of your foreign goods

01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:56.182
The land that gave you birth,
the land that you love ...

01:03:56.393 --> 01:03:59.022
... help that land

01:03:59.172 --> 01:04:02.622
Cloth from foreign mills, sugar ...

01:04:02.858 --> 01:04:05.982
... salt, soap ...

01:04:06.422 --> 01:04:09.702
... scissors and knives ...

01:04:10.062 --> 01:04:13.622
Surrender them in the
noble cause of Swadeshi

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.630
We beseech you : don't just sit there

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:20.110
Come ahead and help in
the cause of Swadeshi.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:24.150
Let the Maharaja come and tell us

01:04:24.548 --> 01:04:25.950
We won't listen to you

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:32.030
Your Maharaja is my friend.
I am his guest

01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:35.550
Isn't that proof enough
that I have his support ?

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:38.434
If we poor traders have
nothing to sell, we'll starve

01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:43.100
We've tried selling
Indian goods. Nobody buys them

01:04:43.177 --> 01:04:44.270
You have money.

01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:49.150
It's easy for you to say
don't sell foreign goods

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.110
We're poor. How can we
live without our trade ?

01:04:58.254 --> 01:05:00.950
It's clear that persuasion
won't work in Nikhil's estate

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.550
We have to use other means

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.630
Any compromise would
cripple our movement

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:15.110
Hail Motherland !

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:16.830
Hail Motherland !

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:18.350
Hail Motherland !

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.870
Hail Motherland !

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:21.390
Hail Motherland !

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:24.569
Hail Motherland !

01:05:24.646 --> 01:05:26.670
Hail Motherland !

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.425
Hail Motherland !

01:05:28.501 --> 01:05:30.070
Hail Motherland !

01:05:30.147 --> 01:05:31.710
Hail Motherland !

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:33.430
Hail Motherland !

01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:35.113
Hail Motherland !

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.790
Hail Motherland !

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:38.590
Hail Motherland !

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.310
Hail Motherland !

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:42.030
Hail Motherland !

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.790
Hail Motherland !

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:45.514
Hail Motherland !

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.310
Hail Motherland !

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:49.070
Hail Motherland !

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:50.830
Hail Motherland !

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:52.393
This is Mr. Sanyal

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.153
Greetings.

01:05:54.229 --> 01:05:55.950
Come on.

01:06:00.682 --> 01:06:03.281
Were those snatched from the villagers ?

01:06:03.682 --> 01:06:04.961
Yes. German wrappers

01:06:10.082 --> 01:06:10.802
Sit down.

01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:16.322
You may enjoy bonfire, but
those fellows may have you up

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:22.121
We'll set fire to their crops if they do

01:06:23.362 --> 01:06:24.962
Can't we try picketing ?

01:06:26.842 --> 01:06:30.202
It's worked elsewhere

01:06:31.202 --> 01:06:35.321
Picketing won't work here; I
know what works and what doesn't

01:06:37.396 --> 01:06:38.362
Sit down.

01:06:45.682 --> 01:06:47.561
An English brand, I see

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:50.282
One item where I draw
the line at Swadeshi

01:06:50.678 --> 01:06:51.641
May I try one ?

01:06:51.881 --> 01:06:52.562
Sure.

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:57.962
These people won't
take persuasion, Amulya

01:06:58.376 --> 01:07:00.002
They've been pampered too much

01:07:00.253 --> 01:07:01.162
Listen.

01:07:01.654 --> 01:07:03.962
I've been Manager of this estate since

01:07:04.209 --> 01:07:07.369
the time of the
present landlord's father

01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:13.288
The father was a tough one;
the trouble is with the son

01:07:13.719 --> 01:07:15.529
If only he'd been firm,

01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:19.089
he could have brought
these fellows to their knees

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.808
It would be plain selling for you

01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:26.968
Tell me how you can help

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:32.449
If you can't stop the
influx of foreign goods ...

01:07:33.409 --> 01:07:36.409
... you can't stop the trade in them

01:07:37.729 --> 01:07:41.289
Those boats bring in the goods;

01:07:42.609 --> 01:07:45.369
you have to deal with the boatmen first

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:46.929
Can you do that for me ?

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:53.169
The trouble is, the
boatmen's leader is a stubborn fellow

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.009
What's his name ?

01:07:57.249 --> 01:08:00.369
Mirjan. A Muslim.
He's a hard nut to crack

01:08:01.908 --> 01:08:02.968
Can't he be brought round ?

01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:05.169
There's a way round everything,
Mr. Mukerji

01:08:06.328 --> 01:08:12.169
A boat which sails is
also a boat which sinks

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:18.688
But this is where you
need more than words

01:08:19.932 --> 01:08:20.972
You need ...

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:22.372
Money ?

01:08:23.012 --> 01:08:26.692
We have to stop tongues wagging,
pay compensation ...

01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:30.252
... bribe the police
- it all needs hard cash

01:08:33.892 --> 01:08:39.612
It's not that we haven't money
- and more can be raised

01:08:39.852 --> 01:08:42.052
Then you can rely on me

01:08:43.572 --> 01:08:47.132
I'll do the dirty work all right ...

01:08:47.532 --> 01:08:50.572
... but if it proves awkward for you,

01:08:51.012 --> 01:08:52.452
..you'll have to fend for yourself

01:08:55.345 --> 01:08:57.412
You need not worry about that.

01:08:57.878 --> 01:09:00.332
But if I find myself in trouble ...

01:09:00.612 --> 01:09:02.772
... I'm not taking all the blame

01:09:11.012 --> 01:09:12.852
I mean to preserve this letter from you

01:09:16.732 --> 01:09:20.292
I didn't go. He asked for me

01:09:20.692 --> 01:09:25.252
I gave an excuse and stayed back,
but what good did it do ?

01:09:25.732 --> 01:09:29.172
All day yesterday I kept thinking of him

01:09:29.652 --> 01:09:32.252
Why should this happen to a woman who

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:35.892
never had a thought of any man ...

01:09:36.437 --> 01:09:38.052
... except her own husband ?

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.972
You didn't say you
wanted the fish cooked, madam

01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:46.292
Make curry with ground mustard-seed

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.351
Younger madam.

01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:58.910
Yes, Nanku ?

01:09:59.671 --> 01:10:01.351
A letter for you

01:10:10.751 --> 01:10:11.831
Are you better ?

01:10:14.431 --> 01:10:15.191
Yes, thank you

01:10:16.031 --> 01:10:19.190
This boy from our group
is very keen to meet you

01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:27.071
You've seen me once when I was
little; I came with my mother

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.831
What is your mother's name ?
- Soudamini Devi

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:32.992
You're Nibaron Ghosal's son ?

01:10:33.069 --> 01:10:35.471
Yes. My name is Amulya

01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:38.630
How old are you ?

01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:42.470
Seventeen. I was about to
sit my final exam, but I didn't

01:10:43.088 --> 01:10:44.311
Because of Swadeshi ?

01:10:45.151 --> 01:10:46.751
Amulya is a good worker

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.151
He knows the Gita

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:51.511
Really?

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.831
Here it is.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.311
Do you always carry it ?

01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:01.111
Always. The Gita gives one courage

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.311
Even to die for one's country

01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:07.070
Aren't you afraid to die ?

01:11:08.191 --> 01:11:13.910
Even when a man dies, his soul lives

01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:17.030
It always remains constant.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.831
Soul doesn't get destroyed.
Only the body does.

01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:22.231
Even if a man dies,
soul never dies, sister.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.991
You may go now

01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:31.351
Mr. Mukerji said you believed in
Swadeshi. I wanted to pay my respects

01:11:31.751 --> 01:11:32.591
I am leaving, sister.

01:11:34.031 --> 01:11:36.110
I'll come again.
- Please do

01:11:36.555 --> 01:11:37.790
Hail Motherland !

01:11:39.071 --> 01:11:39.881
Hail Motherland !

01:11:39.958 --> 01:11:40.471
I am leaving.

01:11:52.151 --> 01:11:53.510
What are you thinking ?

01:11:54.671 --> 01:11:57.551
Is there any danger to
your life in the work you do ?

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:08.150
Since we set ourselves
against our formidable rulers ...

01:12:10.231 --> 01:12:11.951
... there certainly is

01:12:18.195 --> 01:12:21.110
But my boys are a plucky lot

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:24.230
My courage doesn't match theirs

01:12:24.513 --> 01:12:27.311
That's a strange
confession from a leader

01:12:30.216 --> 01:12:32.096
Sometimes the truth comes out

01:12:37.256 --> 01:12:39.296
Now may I have a bit of truth from you ?

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:41.175
What ?

01:12:43.136 --> 01:12:47.535
After so many years, why suddenly
decide to come out of seclusion ?

01:12:48.735 --> 01:12:50.336
Don't you know why ?

01:12:51.252 --> 01:12:52.376
How should I know ?

01:12:53.117 --> 01:12:59.496
You ought to know, you're a man

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.935
But you haven't a woman's intuition

01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:05.376
Will you tell me why ?

01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:34.051
I'd never been face to
face with a leader before

01:13:36.491 --> 01:13:40.291
I fear the leader may have let you down

01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:49.771
Not so far

01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:15.051
You play the piano, too ?

01:14:16.371 --> 01:14:21.731
I was taking lessons.
Piano ... singing ...

01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:24.251
English songs ?

01:14:27.388 --> 01:14:32.731
"That to me were so dear."

01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:39.451
"Long, long ago. Long, long ago."

01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:44.091
"Same are the songs."

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.971
"I am delighted to hear."

01:14:48.511 --> 01:14:51.091
"Long, long ago. Long, long ago."

01:14:52.398 --> 01:14:54.731
"Long ago."

01:14:56.206 --> 01:14:57.331
Yesterday ...

01:14:58.371 --> 01:15:02.571
... I had a feeling that
you were not really well

01:15:03.927 --> 01:15:06.291
I racked my brains
all day trying to guess

01:15:07.491 --> 01:15:13.211
What had I done or said to annoy you ?

01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:19.331
You haven't told me yet why you called

01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:21.811
I just wanted to see you

01:15:23.889 --> 01:15:25.211
Is that the reason ?

01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:32.531
I didn't see you yesterday and it
turned out to be a dismal day for me

01:15:33.691 --> 01:15:38.331
My pride as a leader was badly shaken

01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:40.971
The people won't listen to you ?

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.571
Sometimes words are not enough

01:15:45.091 --> 01:15:48.291
Why do you do then ?
- Try other ways

01:15:49.731 --> 01:15:51.171
May I know what ways ?

01:15:52.398 --> 01:15:54.851
Because my husband's
not going to help you

01:15:59.142 --> 01:16:00.331
Has Nikhil said so ?

01:16:08.684 --> 01:16:10.685
Do you know what I feel sometimes ?

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:12.845
To hell with Swadeshi !

01:16:13.925 --> 01:16:16.604
I'll spend my life chatting to Queen Bee

01:16:18.524 --> 01:16:21.404
With me ?... You ?

01:16:22.565 --> 01:16:23.645
Would you mind ?

01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:28.644
Why laugh ?

01:16:29.244 --> 01:16:31.724
It's so absurd

01:16:32.285 --> 01:16:35.804
You're not the type to
spend even an hour chatting

01:16:39.119 --> 01:16:40.205
You're right

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.284
The truth is ...

01:16:44.645 --> 01:16:48.764
... I need politics
as much as I need you

01:16:52.205 --> 01:16:54.804
I don't want you to give up at all

01:16:56.242 --> 01:16:59.964
My husband and I don't
see eye to eye on this

01:17:00.884 --> 01:17:04.685
He has many gifts and
I admire him for them

01:17:05.964 --> 01:17:11.165
But he is much too placid

01:17:11.924 --> 01:17:14.964
You can't afford to be
so at a time like this

01:17:18.564 --> 01:17:20.364
I entirely agree with you

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:26.004
My husband says you
don't think of poor ...

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.124
... so you can't really
do the country any good

01:17:32.804 --> 01:17:36.044
I don't believe you'll hurt the poor

01:17:36.924 --> 01:17:40.044
You'll do as much as
possible with persuasion

01:17:46.205 --> 01:17:47.684
But the problem is ...

01:17:50.285 --> 01:17:52.445
... persuasion doesn't always work

01:17:54.686 --> 01:17:57.845
You need more than that.
- What do you need ?

01:18:01.404 --> 01:18:04.205
Let's not talk about that.
- I want to know

01:18:05.784 --> 01:18:08.246
I don't want to talk about
mundane matters with you

01:18:08.323 --> 01:18:09.164
Why?

01:18:12.019 --> 01:18:15.219
I want no note of
discord in our relationship

01:18:16.012 --> 01:18:18.499
But I'd be really happy to help

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.459
This is beyond you, Queen

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.660
Haven't you seen me
going beyond myself ?

01:18:25.649 --> 01:18:27.699
I know you can go a long way.

01:18:27.776 --> 01:18:30.900
Even so, I'd rather not talk about it

01:18:32.739 --> 01:18:37.380
Then there's no reason for me to stay

01:18:38.419 --> 01:18:39.139
I am leaving.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.500
Please, don't go away like that

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:48.103
If I'm not needed for the cause,
then I'm just wasting my time here

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.619
I didn't wish to cause
you anxiety for my sake

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.339
Is politics, my work, the
only thing we must talk about ?

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:59.139
Promise you'll tell
me if you need money,

01:18:59.304 --> 01:19:01.316
..and you'll take it if I give it

01:19:01.393 --> 01:19:02.063
I promise

01:19:02.775 --> 01:19:07.459
I will give my word,
Mukhi. I am giving my word.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.460
I'll come again this evening.
Please wait for me here

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.379
I hate having to send for you every time

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.099
Let go of me

01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:20.619
Promise that you'll come to me everyday

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:24.099
I must see you at least once every day

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.539
There's nothing
wrong in that. Promise me

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.339
All right

01:19:33.599 --> 01:19:36.900
Please let go of my hand. I want to go

01:20:00.259 --> 01:20:02.619
Khemi, do the room later

01:21:15.168 --> 01:21:20.340
Gently she walks, the Beauteous One

01:21:26.816 --> 01:21:28.539
Back so early ?

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.260
What are you gawping at ?

01:21:36.699 --> 01:21:41.460
What is there to gawp at
but you ? Such goings on !

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:47.499
Such tender concern for our guest;
enough to make him stay for ever

01:21:49.298 --> 01:21:53.580
In our time we had to
look after our husbands, too

01:21:56.059 --> 01:22:02.139
If only my brother-in-law were a
guest here, he'd be warmly welcomed

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:04.939
I don't want any advice from you

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.020
I was a small girl when
I came here as a bride

01:22:14.203 --> 01:22:18.259
Your husband was my playmate then

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.780
Where were you then ?

01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.900
You need not repeat what I already know

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:31.637
He was the only one who felt for me

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:33.241
He used to say :

01:22:34.634 --> 01:22:39.459
" We're still in the Dark Ages,
that's why you suffer so "

01:22:41.499 --> 01:22:45.060
" For you, having a husband is
just as painful as losing one

01:22:45.708 --> 01:22:50.779
" My wife shall be a
free woman ", he'd say

01:22:53.664 --> 01:22:56.340
Well, I see the free
woman before my eyes

01:23:00.663 --> 01:23:05.019
But don't forget, dear sister,
there is a God above us ...

01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:09.099
... and He has eyes, too

01:23:22.277 --> 01:23:24.117
I believed I had strength to bear ...

01:23:25.236 --> 01:23:29.796
... whatever misfortune
Fate had in store for me

01:23:30.597 --> 01:23:35.517
I would call up visions of
suffering and steel myself against them

01:23:36.717 --> 01:23:41.757
Visions of poverty,
imprisonment, dishonour, death ...

01:23:42.957 --> 01:23:45.837
... even Bimala's death

01:23:47.477 --> 01:23:50.237
But one thing I could
never imagine happening

01:23:51.957 --> 01:23:55.277
Now I keep asking
myself again and again..

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:58.116
..have I the strength to bear this ?

01:23:58.197 --> 01:23:59.957
Hail Motherland !

01:24:00.036 --> 01:24:02.037
Hail Motherland !

01:24:02.117 --> 01:24:03.917
Hail Motherland !

01:24:03.996 --> 01:24:06.036
Hail Motherland !

01:24:06.117 --> 01:24:07.716
Hail Motherland !

01:24:07.797 --> 01:24:09.756
Hail Motherland !

01:24:09.837 --> 01:24:11.676
Hail Motherland !

01:24:11.757 --> 01:24:13.716
Hail Motherland !

01:24:13.797 --> 01:24:15.557
Hail Motherland !

01:24:15.636 --> 01:24:17.637
Hail Motherland !

01:24:17.717 --> 01:24:19.517
Hail Motherland !

01:24:23.477 --> 01:24:24.437
What do you want ?

01:24:25.077 --> 01:24:27.156
We have some questions

01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:28.557
Hail Motherland !

01:24:29.076 --> 01:24:31.836
Why don't you clear our
market of foreign goods ?

01:24:32.357 --> 01:24:33.437
I have a reason

01:24:33.557 --> 01:24:35.556
You'd lose by it ?

01:24:37.677 --> 01:24:41.397
Not me, but the poor would lose

01:24:42.117 --> 01:24:43.557
The country will gain.

01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:47.357
We've given up foreign
goods for the country's sake

01:24:47.733 --> 01:24:51.756
How can you compare
yourselves with the poor ?

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.516
You can afford to
spend more on Indian goods

01:24:59.418 --> 01:25:03.837
The poor do not stand in your way.
Why do you stand in theirs ?

01:25:04.097 --> 01:25:07.000
You want to oppose a nation
that's taken the vow of Swadeshi ?

01:25:07.077 --> 01:25:09.996
It's beyond my power to do so

01:25:11.293 --> 01:25:14.196
But how can you say the
nation's taken your vow ?

01:25:15.151 --> 01:25:19.150
Aren't the traders part of the nation ?

01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:22.711
So you won't throw out foreign goods ?

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:27.350
No, because the
goods do not belong to me

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:30.031
Hail Motherland !

01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:31.990
Hail Motherland !

01:25:32.071 --> 01:25:33.871
Hail Motherland !

01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:35.753
Hail Motherland !

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.634
Hail Motherland !

01:25:37.711 --> 01:25:39.430
Hail Motherland !

01:25:39.507 --> 01:25:41.390
Hail Motherland !

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:46.990
No, I think this is the one.

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:52.790
What are you looking for ?

01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:58.270
Passiflora. Didn't you have a phial ?

01:26:00.468 --> 01:26:01.910
Have you been sleeping badly ?

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:07.111
One sleeps less as one grows older ...

01:26:08.178 --> 01:26:09.909
... but less these last three nights

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:13.231
Here it is

01:26:13.951 --> 01:26:15.151
Please keep the phial

01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:16.910
Thank you.

01:26:25.724 --> 01:26:27.790
I don't like it, Nikhil

01:26:29.298 --> 01:26:35.110
I have grave misgivings
about the way things are shaping

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:42.710
Everyone knows that Sandip
is your friend and your guest

01:26:43.475 --> 01:26:47.390
Soon they'll believe that
whatever he's doing has your sanction

01:26:48.477 --> 01:26:53.230
Don't you realise the terrible
consequences it may have for you ?

01:26:55.589 --> 01:26:58.030
The consequences can
already be felt, sir

01:26:59.148 --> 01:27:00.871
That I'm a lackey of the British ...

01:27:01.787 --> 01:27:04.111
... that I don't force Swadeshi

01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:07.302
.. on my tenants for
fear they'd stop paying rent

01:27:07.379 --> 01:27:08.202
No, no.

01:27:08.279 --> 01:27:09.991
Don't let that worry you

01:27:10.567 --> 01:27:15.470
Nothing can touch you as long
as you have a clear conscience

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:19.510
But the portents are bad, Nikhil

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:26.990
Muslim preachers from Dacca are
going around setting on the peasants

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:28.630
Do you keep a check on those?

01:27:30.031 --> 01:27:31.777
I've read about it in the papers

01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:34.231
What's to stop them coming here ?

01:27:35.562 --> 01:27:36.604
Nothing

01:27:36.681 --> 01:27:37.510
So?

01:27:40.113 --> 01:27:41.512
If anything should happen,

01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:46.353
..how could we put all the
blame on the preachers ?

01:27:47.752 --> 01:27:51.793
What about our own responsibility ?

01:27:53.992 --> 01:27:56.673
Think how we ourselves
have treated the poor Muslims

01:27:58.095 --> 01:28:01.792
Have we even given them
their dues as human beings ?

01:28:02.232 --> 01:28:05.512
That's true, but what's to be done now ?

01:28:09.226 --> 01:28:10.265
I'll go around

01:28:12.145 --> 01:28:17.305
I'll see for myself. Rumours can mislead

01:28:18.065 --> 01:28:21.305
Can't you have a word
with the Magistrate ?

01:28:22.265 --> 01:28:24.505
I don't think he'd mind a riot;

01:28:25.546 --> 01:28:27.586
that would make short work of Swadeshi

01:28:27.905 --> 01:28:29.945
There is one thing you can do

01:28:32.185 --> 01:28:34.666
You can at least root out
the source of the trouble.

01:28:35.945 --> 01:28:37.825
Why let Sandip stay ?

01:28:45.346 --> 01:28:47.105
I thought he'd leave his own accord

01:28:50.986 --> 01:28:52.505
But now ...

01:28:52.865 --> 01:28:55.666
Leave ? Why ?

01:28:56.305 --> 01:28:59.146
With all the comfort and
protection he enjoys here ?

01:28:59.785 --> 01:29:04.985
Besides, you've done him a special
favour, introducing him to your wife

01:29:05.225 --> 01:29:07.465
Isn't he taking full advantage of that ?

01:29:08.185 --> 01:29:11.266
I'd no idea he'd changed so much

01:29:11.665 --> 01:29:16.906
All this adulation has turned his head

01:29:18.946 --> 01:29:23.345
I think it comes from a
deep sense of frustration

01:29:25.458 --> 01:29:30.865
With all his gifts, he
couldn't really accomplish anything

01:29:32.851 --> 01:29:36.826
Sometimes I feel pity for him

01:29:37.263 --> 01:29:39.865
This is no time for pity, Nikhil

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.866
You can't bring
yourself to be firm with him,

01:29:45.184 --> 01:29:46.666
..because he's close to you ...

01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:51.665
... but I fail to see why you
vacillate at a time like this

01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:57.665
You would see if I
told you ... but I can't

01:32:40.365 --> 01:32:41.325
Remember this ?

01:32:49.805 --> 01:32:52.125
It's from my factory

01:32:56.845 --> 01:32:58.045
You've saved it ?

01:32:59.245 --> 01:33:00.605
Not just the soap

01:33:02.525 --> 01:33:06.165
Towels, pens, matchboxes
- everything

01:33:10.405 --> 01:33:12.125
Did you ever use it ?

01:33:15.205 --> 01:33:19.685
It's no good for anything,
not even for washing clothes

01:33:25.485 --> 01:33:27.485
What foolish notions I had then

01:33:28.005 --> 01:33:29.245
You still have

01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:35.005
You freed her from her moorings,
now look where she's drifted

01:33:37.593 --> 01:33:39.125
That was no foolish notion

01:33:40.165 --> 01:33:41.365
You still insist ?

01:33:47.045 --> 01:33:51.925
If she likes what she's doing,
then that's the kind of person she is

01:33:53.925 --> 01:33:58.365
I could stop her from going,
but it wouldn't change her

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:01.885
You can teach a child,
but not the grown-up

01:34:02.566 --> 01:34:04.245
The husband is the master

01:34:06.653 --> 01:34:10.885
Bending her to my will would not help

01:34:12.373 --> 01:34:17.605
At least get him out of the way;
he's not a friendly friend, is he ?

01:34:19.408 --> 01:34:26.565
It would certainly do my estate
good to get him out of the way

01:34:28.393 --> 01:34:32.445
But I'm selfish enough
to think of myself, too

01:34:35.041 --> 01:34:38.525
I can't help it. I must

01:34:39.917 --> 01:34:43.342
If he goes, you'll
find her back by your side

01:34:46.866 --> 01:34:51.205
And I would find her regretting it

01:34:53.199 --> 01:34:56.965
Because she would not be
doing it out of choice

01:34:58.736 --> 01:35:00.005
That would be unbearable

01:35:01.894 --> 01:35:05.885
As much for her as for me

01:35:11.263 --> 01:35:12.943
I can't do it

01:35:13.519 --> 01:35:15.278
Hail Motherland !

01:35:15.359 --> 01:35:17.239
Hail Motherland !

01:35:17.318 --> 01:35:19.199
Hail Motherland !

01:35:19.279 --> 01:35:20.918
Hail Motherland !

01:35:20.999 --> 01:35:22.838
Hail Motherland !

01:35:22.915 --> 01:35:24.562
Hail Motherland !

01:35:24.638 --> 01:35:26.362
Hail Motherland !

01:35:26.438 --> 01:35:28.159
Hail Motherland !

01:35:28.238 --> 01:35:29.839
Hail Motherland !

01:35:32.558 --> 01:35:34.159
Hail Motherland !

01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:03.559
Hail Motherland !

01:36:04.319 --> 01:36:05.399
What is the matter?

01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:06.758
Why so late ?

01:36:07.238 --> 01:36:09.638
That was a lot of work, Mr. Mukherji

01:36:10.718 --> 01:36:12.839
There's a play at Chandrapur tonight;

01:36:12.919 --> 01:36:15.359
I had to wait for the boatmen to go

01:36:15.638 --> 01:36:18.479
These jobs can't be
done with people around

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:20.558
Mirjan's boat ?

01:36:22.319 --> 01:36:23.039
Good

01:36:24.518 --> 01:36:28.519
But when he comes back and
finds his boat missing ...

01:36:28.598 --> 01:36:33.719
... it won't take him to
put two and two together ...

01:36:34.519 --> 01:36:37.639
... and then he'll come
groveling to you and beg for compensation

01:36:39.278 --> 01:36:43.439
Keep 5,000 or so handy

01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:47.198
I will.

01:36:47.279 --> 01:36:49.679
And now a word of advice ...

01:36:50.999 --> 01:36:54.919
... if you don't mind my being frank

01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:57.719
Out with it. It's late

01:36:58.159 --> 01:37:03.638
I think you should wind
up here fast and decamp

01:37:06.942 --> 01:37:07.718
Why ?

01:37:08.208 --> 01:37:10.039
The outlook's bad

01:37:10.559 --> 01:37:12.158
There may be a riot

01:37:12.991 --> 01:37:14.399
You may be a leader,

01:37:14.756 --> 01:37:19.118
..but you're not exactly
a popular one, you know

01:37:19.723 --> 01:37:24.079
They're certainly not
eager to put you on a pedestal

01:37:27.588 --> 01:37:32.599
I'll decide what to do, Mr.
Sanyal. You don't have to worry

01:37:37.317 --> 01:37:44.724
Onward, sons of India,
the Motherland calls

01:37:44.801 --> 01:37:52.199
Onward, sons of India,
the Motherland calls

01:37:52.276 --> 01:37:59.666
The strong, the brave, the proud,
to serve the nation's cause

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:07.478
Onward, sons of India,
the Motherland calls

01:38:08.904 --> 01:38:11.119
You should give up
politics and take to singing

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:16.399
I once had an idea to go on the stage

01:38:17.185 --> 01:38:21.079
It's wonderful to be able to
hold a large audience in your grip

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.799
I thought that when I heard
you speak the other evening

01:38:26.758 --> 01:38:27.998
Of course ...

01:38:28.749 --> 01:38:33.438
... it's nothing like
winning the heart of a woman

01:38:35.078 --> 01:38:38.038
I gather you've won the
hearts of many women ...

01:38:39.078 --> 01:38:42.798
... and not all of them Swadeshi

01:38:43.088 --> 01:38:44.234
This is bad!

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.478
Has Nikhil told you all this ?

01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:51.586
Why not ? After all, you
know such a lot about me

01:38:52.663 --> 01:38:58.358
Youthful indiscretions, that's
what they were - ancient history

01:38:58.853 --> 01:39:01.158
I wonder what happened to those women

01:39:01.929 --> 01:39:06.689
You shouldn't. I'm longer
the same person, you know

01:39:08.049 --> 01:39:10.849
Still, it helps to understand the person

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:13.649
It's not difficult to understand men

01:39:14.049 --> 01:39:18.889
It's women who are unfathomable;
one despairs of knowing their minds

01:39:19.449 --> 01:39:22.049
You know that song, don't you ?
- What song ?

01:39:23.409 --> 01:39:29.089
"Who can ever fathom a woman's ways ?"

01:39:29.169 --> 01:39:31.969
"Who can ever fathom a woman's ways ?"

01:39:32.529 --> 01:39:35.009
"Her silence mean more than what she says"

01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:38.129
"She looks at you, then drops her eyes"

01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:40.449
"Her silence mean more than what she says"

01:39:40.529 --> 01:39:42.769
"She looks at you, then drops her eyes"

01:39:42.849 --> 01:39:45.409
"She laughs one moment the next she cries"

01:39:46.129 --> 01:39:51.969
"She lingers close,
then leaves you in a daze"

01:39:52.049 --> 01:39:57.729
"Who can ever fathom a woman's ways ?"

01:39:57.809 --> 01:40:00.609
"Who can ever fathom a woman's ways ?"

01:40:01.689 --> 01:40:04.449
Is that why you haven't married ?

01:40:05.729 --> 01:40:10.049
How can I marry if I can't
find a woman after my heart ?

01:40:10.809 --> 01:40:15.329
I waited a long time for you
last night. You didn't come

01:40:18.194 --> 01:40:23.474
Forgive me, Queen. I was
very busy; I got back late

01:40:23.914 --> 01:40:28.274
What were you busy with ?
- The cause of Swadeshi, of course

01:40:28.594 --> 01:40:31.477
Making speeches ?
- Oh, no

01:40:31.554 --> 01:40:32.514
What, then?

01:40:34.074 --> 01:40:39.674
Winding up. I can't stay
here for ever, you know

01:40:41.594 --> 01:40:43.354
We have to be on the move, campaigning

01:40:46.994 --> 01:40:49.554
You'll go away ?

01:40:50.914 --> 01:40:52.674
I must, sooner or later

01:40:55.714 --> 01:40:57.354
What if Queen Bee doesn't let you go ?

01:41:01.714 --> 01:41:04.274
Then no one would be happier than I,

01:41:04.674 --> 01:41:06.834
but I'm not thinking of going yet

01:41:07.314 --> 01:41:09.154
There are problem to be cleared up

01:41:10.674 --> 01:41:11.874
Tell me

01:41:12.594 --> 01:41:13.314
What?

01:41:14.194 --> 01:41:15.594
How much money ?

01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:26.674
Tell me.

01:41:28.069 --> 01:41:32.034
About five thousand, Queen. We
spend more than we reckoned on

01:41:32.395 --> 01:41:36.474
If I get the money, you'll
have to take it without question

01:41:37.692 --> 01:41:41.394
If you say so, but you
mustn't part with your ornaments

01:41:42.442 --> 01:41:44.801
When I said money, I meant money

01:41:47.681 --> 01:41:49.322
What if I can't repay it ?

01:41:50.122 --> 01:41:54.962
I don't expect you to. Can't I
do this much for the cause ?

01:41:57.242 --> 01:41:58.644
I'm worried, Queen

01:41:59.002 --> 01:41:59.642
Why?

01:42:01.802 --> 01:42:06.922
I seem to have become a burden to you.
But I can't help it. I can explain

01:42:07.001 --> 01:42:12.362
You don't have to.
Only tell me one thing

01:42:13.121 --> 01:42:13.922
What?

01:42:15.161 --> 01:42:17.122
If I give you the money, you won't go ?

01:42:17.402 --> 01:42:19.282
Do you think I want to leave you ?

01:42:21.122 --> 01:42:23.482
Then what made you talk of going away ?

01:42:24.161 --> 01:42:30.289
After all the torment I've
been through, only for your sake

01:42:30.598 --> 01:42:31.217
And..

01:42:31.294 --> 01:42:32.027
And you?

01:43:25.361 --> 01:43:29.762
The Hindus ask you to
join hands with them

01:43:30.761 --> 01:43:34.802
They wheedle you, they coax you...

01:43:35.247 --> 01:43:38.722
... they even use threats

01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:42.962
They want you to take
up Swadeshi at all costs

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:47.681
Don't let their words misguide you

01:43:48.456 --> 01:43:53.801
Hindus don't care for your well-being

01:43:54.032 --> 01:43:57.122
They don't care about you at all.

01:43:57.796 --> 01:44:04.361
Their one aim is to keep you
under their heels for ever

01:44:05.892 --> 01:44:08.932
Don't forget that in Bengal...

01:44:09.172 --> 01:44:15.252
... Muslims are in the majority,
Muslims are mostly peasants

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:18.372
The country's wealth...

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:21.772
...comes from the land

01:44:22.692 --> 01:44:26.572
No part of this wealth
is produced by the Hindus

01:44:27.372 --> 01:44:31.252
It's you who enriched them

01:44:31.692 --> 01:44:36.332
They have no right to
the fruit of your labour

01:44:36.652 --> 01:44:41.572
They use their cunning to
appropriate what you sweat to produce

01:44:42.812 --> 01:44:45.292
So, brother Muslims...

01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:51.092
...do not listen to the Hindus,
don't get mixed up in their politics

01:44:51.492 --> 01:44:53.492
Swadeshi is not for you

01:44:55.292 --> 01:44:59.172
I've sent for you because you lead
the Hindu community in this village

01:45:00.532 --> 01:45:04.332
You are men of discretion and judgement

01:45:05.772 --> 01:45:12.372
I think you will appreciate
what I am going to tell you

01:45:13.530 --> 01:45:14.892
I trust you will

01:45:15.972 --> 01:45:17.492
I only want to say...

01:45:19.292 --> 01:45:21.652
...while we can hold on to
our own religious beliefs...

01:45:23.092 --> 01:45:24.932
... we cannot interfere
with the belief of others

01:45:26.932 --> 01:45:28.172
Even amongst us Hindus...

01:45:29.852 --> 01:45:32.292
...a Vaishnava has no right to prevent
a Shakta spilling the blood of animals

01:45:33.892 --> 01:45:37.332
So, in order to live by their
own religious convictions...

01:45:38.692 --> 01:45:41.212
... the Muslims must be left free

01:45:41.852 --> 01:45:45.252
The Muslims in this
village never slaughtered cows

01:45:45.332 --> 01:45:49.092
We hear they're now doing so

01:45:51.652 --> 01:45:53.092
I've heard so, too

01:45:54.879 --> 01:45:58.772
But I strongly believe that
they're being forced to do so...

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.772
...to stir up trouble
between the two sects

01:46:07.349 --> 01:46:09.252
I urge you not to add fuel to the fire

01:46:09.754 --> 01:46:12.434
They won't stop unless
you put them down, sir.

01:46:12.754 --> 01:46:14.674
The good old days are gone

01:46:15.792 --> 01:46:20.234
Listen. Muslims are a part of India

01:46:21.754 --> 01:46:28.314
This is a fact of history.
You must accept the fact

01:46:30.674 --> 01:46:34.914
We can't imagine an
India without Muslims

01:46:36.754 --> 01:46:40.714
If we try to put them down, it'll
not only not stop the killing of cows

01:46:42.434 --> 01:46:44.754
It may lead to the killing of men

01:46:47.847 --> 01:46:53.034
Never more so than in
the present state of unrest

01:46:54.961 --> 01:47:00.674
You have a grave responsibility now

01:47:05.233 --> 01:47:08.914
I beseech you, I pray you

01:47:11.213 --> 01:47:13.754
Do not encourage hatred

01:47:15.394 --> 01:47:19.994
To do so now would be to court disaster

01:47:35.274 --> 01:47:36.594
Hail Motherland !

01:47:37.994 --> 01:47:39.594
Hail Motherland !

01:48:13.289 --> 01:48:14.034
Nikhil.

01:48:15.065 --> 01:48:16.314
Did you hear a shot ?

01:48:16.848 --> 01:48:17.568
I did.

01:48:18.088 --> 01:48:19.868
What now ?

01:48:19.945 --> 01:48:24.208
I know what must be done

01:48:24.849 --> 01:48:25.968
But first,

01:48:26.448 --> 01:48:29.649
...take my carriage, go home and
come back with your belongings

01:48:30.568 --> 01:48:33.408
The roads are no longer safe; I
don't want you to get into trouble

01:48:34.329 --> 01:48:36.208
That's all very well, but...

01:48:37.768 --> 01:48:39.528
I'll tell Sandip right away

01:49:09.528 --> 01:49:12.849
Time's running out; I
must have the money now

01:49:21.098 --> 01:49:23.658
What's that ?
- Can't you guess ?

01:49:25.498 --> 01:49:26.338
Money ?

01:49:27.415 --> 01:49:28.738
Hardly enough.

01:49:29.058 --> 01:49:30.538
There can't be more
than 500 in those bags

01:49:31.458 --> 01:49:34.378
You must have forgotten,
I asked for 5,000

01:49:40.178 --> 01:49:40.858
What is this?

01:49:42.978 --> 01:49:43.938
Gold coins?

01:49:53.018 --> 01:49:54.258
Gold !

01:49:56.578 --> 01:49:58.258
Gold!

01:50:02.058 --> 01:50:06.778
You should have told me,
or how else would I know ?

01:50:09.498 --> 01:50:10.938
Please don't be angry, Queen

01:50:11.858 --> 01:50:12.578
Sandip.

01:50:18.138 --> 01:50:20.618
I've come to talk to you
- What about?

01:50:22.058 --> 01:50:23.858
I don't want you to stay any longer

01:50:24.698 --> 01:50:29.178
Things have taken a serious turn;
your presence may make matters worse

01:50:30.418 --> 01:50:32.578
I want you to leave
Suksayar by tomorrow morning

01:50:34.618 --> 01:50:36.859
Am I supposed to take orders from you ?

01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:38.818
It's not that

01:50:40.178 --> 01:50:45.098
Your leaving for Calcutta will
help you and ease the situation here

01:50:46.378 --> 01:50:48.178
I have nothing to do in Calcutta

01:50:48.258 --> 01:50:49.818
All the more reason to go

01:50:50.657 --> 01:50:52.460
You've done too much here

01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:56.900
Don't think I haven't been informed

01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.300
From setting fire to
the peasants' barns...

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:03.740
... to sinking Mirjan's boat

01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:11.980
You speak of Hindu-Moslem unity,
but in fact you oppress Muslims

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.100
I shan't put up with it any longer

01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:19.660
I may not believe in Swadeshi...

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:23.300
...but I have true
admiration for some Swadeshi leaders

01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:29.380
But not for those whose
actions believe their words

01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.220
You're harming the country,
not saving it.

01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:36.860
This mustn't go on in my estate

01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:40.540
There's only one person
here I'm prepared to listen to

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:48.300
Queen, do you want me to stay or go ?

01:51:57.343 --> 01:51:58.100
Queen.

01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:01.620
I'm waiting for your answer

01:52:03.534 --> 01:52:05.580
Do you want that I
should leave Suksayar ?

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:09.940
Tell me, Queen

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:13.580
I've said what I came to say

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.900
I hope I won't have to repeat it

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.140
Queen.

01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.340
What's the matter with you ?

01:52:32.694 --> 01:52:33.620
All of a sudden..

01:52:33.697 --> 01:52:35.100
Is Amulya in your room ?

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:36.860
Amulya? - Yes.

01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:38.540
Why ?

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.700
Ask him to see me. It's urgent

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.980
Can't you tell me the reason ?

01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:50.300
No, I'll tell Amulya.
Please send him to me

01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:53.020
Very well

01:54:26.395 --> 01:54:27.075
Amulya.

01:54:30.115 --> 01:54:32.995
Can you do me a favour ?
- Certainly

01:54:33.275 --> 01:54:36.995
Take the morning train to
Calcutta and return in the evening

01:54:37.395 --> 01:54:39.315
Money for the journey is in this box

01:54:39.515 --> 01:54:40.715
What box is that ?

01:54:41.195 --> 01:54:46.075
My jewel case. I need 5,000 rupees.
Sell some of my ornaments

01:54:46.155 --> 01:54:48.195
I'll get you the money without that

01:54:48.275 --> 01:54:52.475
How ? It's not a small sum

01:54:52.555 --> 01:54:53.715
I'll get it

01:54:54.035 --> 01:54:56.115
No, do as I tell you

01:54:56.635 --> 01:54:59.475
But why did you give Mr.
Mukherji 5,000 rupees ?

01:54:59.555 --> 01:55:01.435
He said he needed 5,000

01:55:01.515 --> 01:55:04.715
No, we worked out that we needed 3,500.

01:55:05.075 --> 01:55:07.595
If he gets more, he spends it on himself

01:55:08.155 --> 01:55:11.235
He's quite a spender; he
always by travels first-class

01:55:12.915 --> 01:55:13.798
Mr. Mukherji ?

01:55:13.875 --> 01:55:14.555
Yes, sister.

01:55:14.915 --> 01:55:18.235
He says hardship
saps a leader's strength

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:22.395
Well, I shan't take back
what I've already given

01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:25.595
It may be needed later.
You get me the 5,000.

01:55:26.010 --> 01:55:29.115
Put the box away. I'll
get you the money tonight

01:55:29.342 --> 01:55:31.315
How ?
- From the treasury

01:55:32.122 --> 01:55:35.235
Are you mad ? What about the guards ?

01:55:35.393 --> 01:55:37.155
But we carry arms

01:55:44.936 --> 01:55:46.736
Good heavens !

01:55:47.736 --> 01:55:51.856
Working for the country requires funds

01:55:52.936 --> 01:55:54.936
Have you no qualms about robbing ?

01:55:55.016 --> 01:55:59.456
Whose money is it ? Mine today,
the moneylender's tomorrow

01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:02.416
Why not use it for the cause ?

01:56:02.616 --> 01:56:07.256
No, Amulya. If you go robbing
treasuries, I'll die of fear

01:56:07.576 --> 01:56:09.496
Do as I tell you

01:56:09.656 --> 01:56:15.616
Sell as much as you need
to and bring back the rest

01:56:16.496 --> 01:56:19.896
And be careful, for heaven's sake

01:56:21.336 --> 01:56:22.216
Very well

01:56:26.456 --> 01:56:27.096
I am leaving.

01:56:27.416 --> 01:56:28.136
Yes.

01:56:51.776 --> 01:56:52.536
Queen.

01:57:02.767 --> 01:57:03.776
You're going ?

01:57:04.455 --> 01:57:06.456
Is there any reason for me to stay ?

01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.776
Why do you say that ?

01:57:08.791 --> 01:57:10.936
Can't you hear the not of discord ?

01:57:12.336 --> 01:57:16.696
If I've done anything wrong,
please forgive me. Don't go like this

01:57:18.096 --> 01:57:21.856
My husband says the less one
knows you, the better one like you

01:57:23.256 --> 01:57:25.336
Perhaps I know you too well

01:57:25.904 --> 01:57:30.056
Don't say that. Has
knowing me meant nothing to you ?

01:57:31.006 --> 01:57:32.046
Has it all been in vain ?

01:57:32.965 --> 01:57:35.326
I believed you'd succeed,

01:57:36.085 --> 01:57:37.405
I wanted you to succeed
in what you were doing

01:57:38.046 --> 01:57:39.325
But not any more ?

01:57:42.046 --> 01:57:42.685
No.

01:58:05.125 --> 01:58:09.369
Allah is great !

01:58:09.445 --> 01:58:11.605
Allah is great !

01:58:11.686 --> 01:58:13.446
Allah is great !

01:58:13.525 --> 01:58:15.286
Allah is great !

01:58:17.046 --> 01:58:19.326
Allah is great !

01:58:19.846 --> 01:58:21.486
Allah is great !

01:58:21.606 --> 01:58:23.806
Allah is great !

01:58:59.566 --> 01:59:00.286
Who is it?

01:59:00.726 --> 01:59:01.566
Who is it?

01:59:03.126 --> 01:59:04.086
Who is it? Who is it?

01:59:08.206 --> 01:59:09.046
Hands up !

01:59:12.242 --> 01:59:13.045
Hands up.

01:59:15.966 --> 01:59:18.246
Go indoors !

01:59:24.676 --> 01:59:25.525
Come on.

01:59:28.185 --> 01:59:29.086
Turn round !

01:59:30.295 --> 01:59:31.045
Turn around.

01:59:35.672 --> 01:59:37.112
Now open the safe

01:59:38.232 --> 01:59:38.871
Come on.

01:59:44.472 --> 01:59:47.432
Open it and count out 3,500 rupees

01:59:48.235 --> 01:59:51.591
What's going on ?

01:59:51.672 --> 01:59:52.992
What's the hue and cry about ?

01:59:54.912 --> 01:59:58.551
I don't know. I hope it's not a riot

01:59:58.823 --> 02:00:00.192
What are you saying, brother-in-law?

02:00:01.112 --> 02:00:03.752
What will happen to us ?

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:09.872
We're going to Calcutta
tomorrow; it's no longer safe here

02:00:10.272 --> 02:00:13.032
Who is "we" ? Aren't I coming with you ?

02:00:15.591 --> 02:00:16.592
Did I say that ?

02:00:19.431 --> 02:00:23.352
The Chakravarty's
treasury has been raided

02:00:23.432 --> 02:00:25.712
What's to stop them raiding this place ?

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:29.832
If they kill me they'll burn my
body by the shriveled banyan.

02:00:29.912 --> 02:00:31.112
That's awful

02:00:33.272 --> 02:00:36.992
Start packing; and don't
forget your Talking Machine

02:00:38.493 --> 02:00:40.112
You're not joking, are you ?

02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:45.512
Am I the frivolous
type ? Don't you know me ?

02:01:09.307 --> 02:01:10.112
Bimala.

02:01:13.678 --> 02:01:15.118
I want to tell you something

02:01:15.559 --> 02:01:16.159
What?

02:01:17.438 --> 02:01:21.199
There were 5,000 rupees in
gold coins in two bags in the safe

02:01:22.078 --> 02:01:24.038
I gave them to Sandip

02:01:24.398 --> 02:01:25.639
He needed the money

02:01:26.998 --> 02:01:30.718
Now you know how
hard it is to refuse him

02:01:30.878 --> 02:01:32.359
I'll replace it

02:01:32.678 --> 02:01:36.319
I've given my jewel case to Amulya;
he'll sell ornaments to get the money

02:01:42.038 --> 02:01:46.598
I felt bad speaking to
Sandip like that in your presence

02:01:49.438 --> 02:01:53.798
But I had to. Things
have taken a bad turn

02:01:58.558 --> 02:02:00.638
It's no longer safe for him here

02:02:02.198 --> 02:02:03.878
What about you ?

02:02:08.198 --> 02:02:14.278
Your safety is what
concerns me; no one else's matters

02:02:15.439 --> 02:02:20.198
Tomorrow we're going to Calcutta.
All three of us

02:02:21.679 --> 02:02:23.518
And if something happens before then ?

02:02:27.038 --> 02:02:28.598
You won't leave the house, will you ?

02:02:31.478 --> 02:02:35.078
If something should happen I'd
have to go and intervene, Bimala

02:02:39.518 --> 02:02:40.639
I knew

02:02:43.147 --> 02:02:45.878
I knew I'd be punished

02:02:52.759 --> 02:02:57.158
Punished ? Why ? You
have not done anything wrong

02:02:59.294 --> 02:03:03.575
I can't even ask for forgiveness

02:03:06.134 --> 02:03:11.623
But you've come back
to me, haven't you ?

02:03:20.901 --> 02:03:24.854
What an age it seems since I
last looked at you and spoke to you

02:03:27.215 --> 02:03:31.615
What came over me ? Why
do such things happen ?

02:03:34.175 --> 02:03:35.815
You've done nothing wrong, Bimala

02:03:36.734 --> 02:03:39.295
For ten years you
didn't look at another man

02:03:41.855 --> 02:03:43.454
Why do you forget that ?

02:04:14.485 --> 02:04:15.845
There's 3,500 rupees here

02:04:17.485 --> 02:04:20.085
Please return the jewel
case and the gold coins

02:04:21.862 --> 02:04:24.645
Where did you get the
money ? Where have you been ?

02:04:25.885 --> 02:04:27.365
To the sub-treasury at Chakna

02:04:28.888 --> 02:04:30.285
I hope nobody saw you

02:04:37.965 --> 02:04:39.085
I covered my face

02:04:40.045 --> 02:04:42.685
Did you see any trouble ?
- There's a riot

02:04:44.925 --> 02:04:47.565
Muslims have broken into
the temple of Visalakshi

02:04:58.005 --> 02:04:59.165
You're going ?

02:05:01.205 --> 02:05:02.805
Yes. To Rongpur

02:05:07.965 --> 02:05:09.165
Will you come with me ?

02:05:22.285 --> 02:05:23.205
I must go now

02:05:31.565 --> 02:05:32.605
Hail Motherland !

02:05:34.045 --> 02:05:35.405
Hail Motherland !

02:05:49.005 --> 02:05:50.005
What are you thinking ?

02:05:51.605 --> 02:05:52.605
Nothing

02:05:54.885 --> 02:05:56.725
I don't want to think

02:05:58.445 --> 02:05:59.925
I want to forget

02:06:01.885 --> 02:06:04.725
All that has happened
in the last few days

02:06:05.405 --> 02:06:07.885
Why must you forget ?

02:06:12.485 --> 02:06:13.525
Come in, Sandip

02:06:17.221 --> 02:06:19.062
This is the age of breaking rules.

02:06:20.101 --> 02:06:21.501
Your wife came out of seclusion...

02:06:22.302 --> 02:06:25.621
...and now I've invaded
the privacy of your bedroom

02:06:28.422 --> 02:06:32.064
These are your property,
which I duly return

02:06:33.102 --> 02:06:35.982
One jewel case and
two bags of gold coins

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:37.422
Jewel case ?

02:06:38.982 --> 02:06:42.621
Your devotee didn't take it with him,
but he's brought the money

02:06:45.861 --> 02:06:47.742
Since you have your valuables,

02:06:47.821 --> 02:06:50.101
I hope you won't mind
my keeping the money

02:06:50.701 --> 02:06:51.702
Are you going ?

02:06:52.182 --> 02:06:56.142
Yes, Nikhil. The train to
Rongpur leaves in an hour

02:06:58.464 --> 02:07:02.862
You can hear the sound of
riot; Amulya witnessed it

02:07:03.661 --> 02:07:07.581
So I must make my proverbial escape;

02:07:08.382 --> 02:07:12.102
I must live to finish my work, you know

02:07:12.781 --> 02:07:14.502
Don't make the same mistake again.

02:07:15.301 --> 02:07:16.821
Can't you see the result of your action

02:07:18.462 --> 02:07:20.181
I follow the Gita, Nikhil

02:07:20.821 --> 02:07:24.222
I am concerned only with the action,
not with the result

02:07:24.702 --> 02:07:28.182
And I consider Ravana to be
the hero of Ramayana, not Rama

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:31.902
So I can't listen to
the followers of Rama

02:07:32.781 --> 02:07:34.821
The straight path is not my path

02:07:36.301 --> 02:07:37.821
Well, it's time to say good-bye

02:07:43.062 --> 02:07:45.102
I'm keeping this as a memento

02:07:50.181 --> 02:07:54.901
Who knows if we'll ever meet again ?

02:07:57.942 --> 02:07:58.941
Good-bye, Nikhil

02:08:03.741 --> 02:08:04.701
Queen Bee

02:08:10.981 --> 02:08:12.702
Hail Motherland !

02:08:47.403 --> 02:08:52.141
Courage, Bimala. I
must go out to them now

02:08:54.024 --> 02:08:55.741
I must

02:08:58.024 --> 02:09:02.221
Don't stop me. Please

02:09:32.655 --> 02:09:33.649
You let him go ?

02:09:33.726 --> 02:09:36.410
He wouldn't heed us

02:09:38.441 --> 02:09:44.060
You witch ! You send him to his death !

02:09:45.181 --> 02:09:48.942
Have you no pity in
your heart of stone ?
