WEBVTT

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.320
Braju?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.800
Braju? Braju!

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.280
Coming, madam.
- Are you deaf?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
It's past 4:00.
Take tea to the office.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.840
Bankim, Bankim...

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.665
Did I tell you I got a
letter from Umapada?

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480
No.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.400
Didn't he write to you?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.960
When does my brother ever write me?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.440
He hasn't been doing
too well in law.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.440
He asked if there was something
here he could...

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.080
I'd been thinking myself
that if I'd a manager...

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.640
In money matters I am not exactly...

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.200
Could he handle it?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.800
Why not?
It's not hard, and I'd be there.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.720
He's never been able to put
his mind to anything.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.800
He will.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.480
I've already asked him to come.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.320
Until a man's given responsibility,
how do we know...

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.000
Shall I serve you some more?
- No.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.320
You hardly eat anything.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.360
That's why I can work so much,
Charu.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.520
Otherwise the newspaper wouldn't...

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.560
Tell me.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.640
Am I lazy? Good-for-nothing?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.320
Who said that?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960
The British have a phrase,
"The idle rich".

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.960
I intend to prove them wrong.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.960
Just having money doesn't
mean you're lazy.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.880
You don't have any regrets, do you?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040
Why?

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.480
I spend so much money on the paper.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.960
Just the other day...

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.440
I bought a new printing press.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.440
What of it?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.800
You are doing such good things...

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.640
And making a name for yourself.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.280
After all,
we aren't about to starve.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.120
You know,
when I hear Suren Banerjee speak...

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.280
Someday I'll explain this business
of politics to you.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560
All right?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.280
Intellectual power may be good...

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.360
in its own way.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.640
But it's not intellectual
eminence...

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.520
that constitutes individual
or national greatness.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.520
It is energy, patriotism...

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.280
devotion to duty...

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.200
the capacity for self-sacrifice...

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.360
an unflinching regard for truth.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.240
It is these...

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.400
Just two more minutes, Charu.
I know it's very late in the night.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.280
I didn't come to hurry you.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560
Here.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.960
Did you made this?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.480
Next time I'll embroider
you some slippers.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.080
When do you find the time?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.840
It's not like I lack for time.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.400
Charu.
You're very lonely, aren't you?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.840
Oh, I am used to it now.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.240
Loneliness isn't something
to get used to, Charu.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.760
Have you read Swarnalata?
- What?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320
Swarnalata.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.280
Why do you laugh?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280
Charu.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.280
I have my Charulata.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.640
I need nothing else.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.600
Plays, novels, poetry...

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.400
I don't need such things,
understand?

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320
I tell you what...

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.160
I will write to your brother...

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.920
and ask him to bring his wife along.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.680
All right?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.960
Then you will have company.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.320
Clubs.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280
Hearts.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.120
Clubs.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.120
Diamonds.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.560
Diamonds?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.720
Diamonds!

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.520
Another round. Here we go.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.040
Hearts.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.240
Diamonds.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.440
Hearts.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.040
Spades.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400
Diamonds.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.080
Come on, play.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760
Ice-cream?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.960
Forget the ice-cream. Play.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.960
Spades!

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.760
Another round.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.880
I told you, you couldn't beat me.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.880
This game is all luck and no brains.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.120
It takes determination.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.720
I'm always telling my husband,
You've no determination.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.280
That's why you never...
- Clubs.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.240
Clubs.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.240
Spades.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.920
Hearts.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.040
Spades.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.440
Diamonds.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.840
Hearts.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.160
Clubs.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.360
Hearts.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.240
Come on, clubs.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.520
Darn it! Spades!

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.880
Come on, hearts.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.960
Oh, no!

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.640
Just three cards left.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.240
Come on.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.200
There's determination for you!

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.160
It must be past 4:00.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.680
Would you ask Braju
to take the tea in?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.920
Braju.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.280
Oh, you!
- All right, I will go.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.120
But your servant's deaf.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.040
He never answers the first time.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.080
Braju, take tea to the office.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.280
Sister-in-law!

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.920
A storm's coming up!

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.080
Get everything in, quick!

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.640
Hail Krishna! Slayer of demons!

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.320
Are you reading Amanda Math?

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.960
Were you due today?
- Where's my cousin?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.440
In the office.
- Paper still going strong?

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.320
Hail Krishna!

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.400
What's going on?
- Look at all this.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.440
Good heavens!

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.360
It's you! How come you are here?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.800
I'd have been here earlier
but for Mother.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.600
How is your mother?
- Fine. Whose tea is that?

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.720
Go on, have it.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.520
Did you get them all?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.000
Tell Braju to bring one more tea.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.640
Well?

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.320
Tell me, what are your plans?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.040
To live off you.
- That's my plan.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.840
What's yours?
- Mine?

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080
To relax...

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.560
Pursue my writing, and...

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
And what?

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.920
And relax some more.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.600
That won't do, brother.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.480
Enough of relaxing.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.840
You will have to work.
- Work?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.040
Oh, that cursed word!

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.360
I'll slap you one! Come on.
- Where?

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.880
Come see my press.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.680
You are here too?

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.320
Uma isn't like you.
He works for The Sentinel!

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.760
Really?
- Come on. We will be right back.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.200
Just two hours' proofreading a day.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.040
Oh no! I am not good with spellings.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.600
No need for that.
Only political diseases.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.440
Let me see a copy.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.640
24th issue of the Sentinel.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.960
Dated April the 9th. 1879.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.920
Careful! It's still wet.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.480
Very nice name.
- That was Nishikanta's idea.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.200
The motto was mine.
- Truth survives.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.400
But will the paper survive?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.840
You missed the most important thing.
My editorial.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.800
What's this?
Criticizing the government?

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400
Why not?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720
Why not, Amol?

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.920
Why are they carrying on
the Afghan campaign?

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.040
Because England's prestige
in Europe is at stake.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.560
But India bears the cost.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.640
Why?

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.560
Should we support this?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.000
And what about the Press Act?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.920
Three years now,
and they haven't changed it.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.080
And what about the Civil
Service scheme?

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.760
What about the Arms Act?
The salt tax? The rent tax?

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.920
The British government is running
the country, fine.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.440
But in this business of
running the country...

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.400
the Indians have no say.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.800
Why? There is no representation.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.240
They've left no scope for that.
Am I wrong to condemn it?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.880
What if you are arrested?
- Why?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.760
To be outspoken isn't necessarily
to be disloyal.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.080
Good Lord, sedition!

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.240
I am not getting involved!

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.520
The storm wreaked havoc...

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.920
with the tram today.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.400
Did you get any advertisers?

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.160
Just one. Holloway's Pills.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.160
A three-month contract because
I went in person.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.080
Bath Gate, Stan Street none
of the big pharmacists?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.840
You have to lower your rates.
- Why?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.960
Four annas per line is too high.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.440
It's a new paper,
with a few subscribers.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.800
It has no prestige yet.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.480
How can you charge the same rates
as the established papers.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.280
Besides, it's a political paper.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.560
No sizzle, no spice.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.200
How can it survive without all that?

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.040
You mean silly satire
and saucy news?

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.600
All the scandals of the marketplace?

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.080
No, Umapada.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.360
No.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.200
I'd sooner give it all up.
- But I need motivation.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.800
There's no rudder, no mast.
This ship just might sink.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.880
We have a rudder!

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.040
I hold that rudder,
and I'm not letting go.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.720
And our mast?
The paper's truth and integrity.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.480
Fine. Then you run the whole thing.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.440
What are you saying?

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.800
Even a penniless widow can stand
on her own these days.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.040
And you think we can't
keep a paper going?

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.920
But the only way is
the way of honesty.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.200
What you're suggesting
isn't honest.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.080
It's the way of prostitution.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.760
So what am I supposed to do?

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.440
Why don't you feel motivated?

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.520
Because you haven't been given
enough responsibility, right?

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600
What's this?

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600
The keys.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.680
From now on, you take complete
charge of the money.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.040
And we reduce rates by one anna.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.920
Let's see if we survive that way.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.120
See here, Umapada.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.800
You know what this paper is to me?

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.720
Your sister's rival.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.840
But don't let that
slip to Charulata.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.800
"Every bud and every
very blossom..."

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.480
"Nods and sways in the
gentle breeze..."

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.880
"Rippling,
laughing in wave and billow..."

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.600
Will this room do?

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.720
Sister-in-law.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.320
You ask if this room will do...

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.240
And I wonder if I can take such
luxury after college life.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.120
What luxury?

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.200
The hardships of your student
days are over.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.240
You have gotten so skinny.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.080
"The cuckoo roams from
bower to bower..."

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.880
"Cuckoo,
cuckoo, cuckoo, she cries..."

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.320
You still sing?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.680
"Deep within my heart
is yearning..."

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.480
"Alas, alas know not why..."

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.440
You will never change!

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.160
Sister-in-law.
- What?

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.880
I need to do something.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.560
What should I do?

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.680
From the way you're going on,
it's very clear.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.760
What?
- Get married.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.280
The female mind always...

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.960
She's here too?
- Didn't you see my husband?

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.120
So spouses have to travel in pairs?

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320
Of course.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.520
You are hungry, aren't you?

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.480
O triangular tidbit...

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.440
I shall...

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.800
The food is good!
She made them, right?

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.960
Why? Couldn't I have?

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.320
No.
- Why?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.560
Then Manda wouldn't have
brought me so many.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.920
A woman can't understand
the female mind.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.680
Only a man can.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.120
Fine. Give me your shirt.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.960
What shirt?

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.360
The one you have on.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.160
It's got a tear so big four
snacks could fit inside.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.760
And give me any other torn
clothes you have.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.880
At the boarding house we
did these things...

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.440
This isn't a boarding house.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.080
"When I leave Lucknow city..."

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.920
Cousin, your printing press
is really something.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.680
It's like correcting exams
by the worst in the class!

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.160
Thank you, brother.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.080
Is it all right?
- Very good.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.240
"What will be the plight..."

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.240
Cousin. Do you get The Lotus?

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.680
I get all those magazines,
but they aren't in here.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.840
Have a look in the next room...

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.360
where Charulata's usually
roaming about.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.400
You don't care for all that?

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.840
Those delights aren't for me.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.400
The gloomy tragedies writers
churn out these days!

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.000
Writing off tragedy, are you?

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.120
Nishikanta once told me...

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.400
that after reading one
of Bankim's novels...

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.640
he couldn't sleep for three nights.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.080
I told him, you must be crazy!

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.400
A healthy fellow like you
needs seven hours' sleep.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.640
A novel comes along and wreaks
havoc with that...

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.640
And you allow it?

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.840
Cousin, suppose the government
announces a new tax tomorrow.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.480
Will you still be able to sleep?

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480
Amol...

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.680
politics is different.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.880
Politics is a living thing.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.040
Real. Palpable.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.520
When an unfair tax is imposed...

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.360
which happens all the time
with Lord Lytton.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.720
We can see with our own eyes...

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.160
How the people of this poor
country are affected!

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.040
How they suffer!

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.560
Which is the greater tragedy?
That or Romeo and Juliet?

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.160
The queen will be saved, all right.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.880
But will the Bengali
people be saved?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.600
With all this gloomy literature,
they're going to the dogs.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.080
We must do something about it.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.400
We must be strong Physically.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.240
Merely exercising the
brain won't do.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760
Absolutely not!

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.800
Have you been exercising?

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480
Just feel and see.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.680
How old are you?
- Twenty-three.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.600
I am 35. Come on.
- What?

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.520
Elbows on the table. - Arm
wrestling? - Come on. - But I am...

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.360
One, two, three.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.560
Bravo. Off to bed now.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.080
Hey.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.400
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.400
You know,
Charu has quite a literary bent.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.920
She's always reading magazines
and such...

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.200
anything in Bengali.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.960
The trouble is...

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.520
I've no time to give
her any guidance.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.880
But I think she has talent.
She writes well.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.040
When I was in Monghir,
she wrote me letters.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.840
She has a wonderful style.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.440
What talent she has, and how much...

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.960
is for you to discover.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.160
Give her some of your time.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.880
Guide her. Get her to write.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.880
If she really has talent,
it mustn't languish.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.960
Understand? Start from tomorrow.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.560
Just one thing She mustn't suspect.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.600
She'd only resist and withdraw
into her shell.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.560
What kind of tax is this?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.640
Instead of writing myself,
I'm to help your wife write.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.480
Do both. You can manage.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.480
I trust you.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.960
Good night.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.120
Oh, my!

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.200
How beautiful!

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.080
Sister-in-law! Hey!

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.840
Stop shouting.
It grates on the ears.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.240
What are you doing
that's so special?

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.880
A person can't even think
with all that noise.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.280
No use worrying and fretting
- Oh, my!

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.360
What is destined to happen
will happen...

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.520
What's this getup?

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.640
Sister-in-law,
prepare a betel leaf for me.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.280
No, sir, I will not!

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.440
What's this?
- Slippers for the master.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.800
What good fortune my cousin has!

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.240
You shall have what he has...

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.480
You mean slippers?

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.200
A wife.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.520
Where did you go?

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.160
To the shop to buy
myself a notebook.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.920
That's what made you so tired?

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.960
Sleepy? You want a pillow?

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.640
All done with studies, exams...

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.840
Professors, cutting classes.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560
What's left?

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.480
Foolishness and mischief?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.960
Poetry.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.240
Rhythm.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.040
You know...

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.600
I was thinking...

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.960
What?

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.440
All of life is like a rhythm.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.080
Birth, death.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.680
Day, night.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.160
Happiness, sorrow.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.520
Meeting, parting.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.760
Like the waves on the ocean...

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.120
now rising, now falling.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.840
One complements the other.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.040
Don't you agree?

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.560
Will you write all that
in your notebook?

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640
Thank you.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.240
How about a game of cards?

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.400
Are the pulse cakes drying?
- Yes.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.240
Shall we play?

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.040
Manda, are you a traditional
woman or a modern woman?

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.120
If you aren't playing,
I'll put the cards away.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.640
Yesterday the queen of spades
got lost under the pillow.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720
Listen.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.600
Any woman who spends her time
reclining on her bed...

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.120
arranging her hair in the mirror...

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.480
embroidering carpets,
reading novels...

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.360
concerned only with her
own well-being...

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.600
May indeed be somewhat
superior to an animal.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.840
But she has little justification
for being born a woman.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.800
We humbly advise a woman
of this ilk...

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.080
to put a rope around her
neck and hang herself.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.120
Are you of that ilk?

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.520
Can I embroider carpets
or read novels?

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.680
You know I can't.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.600
Then you're a traditional woman?
- I don't know.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.560
Traditional woman, leave this room.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.480
We are about to discuss literature.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.440
Leave.
- No.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.800
Then don't.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.560
"Speak just a few words."

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.200
"And a glimpse of your
bright teeth..."

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:15.040
"...will dispel the gloominess
in my heart..."

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.440
"Just as your face..."

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.920
"Gleaming like the moon..."

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.120
"Captivates my partridge-like
eyes..."

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.280
Have you read Manmatha Dutta?
- No.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.680
Have you?
- Yes.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.200
Lonesome Melodies?
- Loathsome melodies.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.680
Lonesome melodies!
- Loathsome melodies.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.600
Yes,
I read it in last month's Lotus.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.120
You don't like Manmatha Dutta?

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.520
No taste. This must change.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.240
Then who do you like?

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800
Bankim Babu.
- Bankim Babu?

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.960
How original!

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.920
How do you expect me to be original?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.800
What do I know?

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.280
I simply said what I liked.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.600
Though I do find him difficult
in places...

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.320
and I have to use the dictionary.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.680
But my, what descriptions!
His women are so beautiful!

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.840
So much perfection isn't right.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.320
They make me feel ugly.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.720
They are all so beautiful.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.720
Mrinalini is beautiful,
Radha Rani is beautiful...

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.840
Saibalini is beautiful,
Kapalkundala is beautiful.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040
And Kundanandini?

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.120
She's beautiful too,
but not perfect.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.800
Lutfunnessa is not perfect either.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.520
She is too tall.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.120
And her lips are a bit thin.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.760
And she is dark-skinned.
- Yes.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.720
Look at our traditional woman.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.920
You mention Bankim and
she starts snoring.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.600
Would you get the mat over there?

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120
The mat?

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.720
Over here.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.680
The garden is a disaster!

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.320
And my cousin said he wanted
a Japanese garden here!

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.120
Your cousin thinks of nothing
but his newspaper.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.240
A stream here...

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.960
with a few lotuses and some ducks...

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.120
and a bridge across it...

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.040
and flowers on both sides.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.760
No peacocks to spread their
plumes and dance?

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.080
No, no peacocks.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.280
None of their screeching.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.160
It would disturb my work.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.960
But some fawns would be nice.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.400
One could sit here and compose
an entire poetry book.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040
Brother-in-law.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.000
Brother-in-law.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.040
Give me a push.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.560
Just once. Then I can manage alone.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.360
Modern woman, this is going too far.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.960
What's the harm in a push?

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.640
There's a tax on swinging now,
you know.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960
Brother-in-law.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.160
Mr. Know-it-All!

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.520
What are you thinking about?

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.480
I am just thinking.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.400
About what?

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.320
Writing something.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040
What will you write?

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.320
That's what I am thinking about.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240
What?

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.160
I am thinking.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.120
Good. Keep thinking.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.760
Think and write.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.360
But not in that notebook.
I'll make you one.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.920
Here's an ink and pen.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.960
O my blank notebook!

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.040
My imagination hasn't
yet touched you.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.200
The day I shall write my last
line on your last page...

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.720
how far off is that day?

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.760
Oh my! My notebook is enchanted!

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.760
Just one touch and
inspiration flows!

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.760
But you must promise one thing.
- What?

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.920
Whatever you write stays
in that notebook.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.200
It's not to be published.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.040
All right?

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.920
All right.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280
You forgot a stroke.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.120
Thank you.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.280
Thank you, thank you.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.160
Done.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.120
End of essay and end of notebook.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.080
Now write a story.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.360
Why?
Is there something wrong with this?

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.680
Listen.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.000
Prince Abhimanyu,
while still in the womb...

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.160
learned only how to penetrate
enemy formations...

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.600
but not how to exit it...

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.840
So a river, emerging from the
mountain's rocky womb...

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:33.040
can only advance and knows
not how to turn back.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.960
O river! O youth!

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.040
O time! O world!

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.000
You too can only march onward.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.120
You never turn back
along the path...

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.600
strewn with memory's gilded pebbles.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.120
Only the mind of man looks back.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.600
The rest of creation never does.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.520
Well?

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.840
Go ahead. I want your opinion.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.720
If it's good,
why, and if it's bad, why.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.960
Say something. Is it bad?

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.320
I'm not saying it's bad.
- Well, then?

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.120
There's just been so much of that.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.200
River, sky, cloud, moon.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.200
Enough?
What is enough in literature?

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.400
And must one only write stories?

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.080
Addison, Steele, Emerson.
Did they write stories?

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.960
Fine. Write whatever you like.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.640
No, I've written enough.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.600
Your turn now.
- Heaven help us!

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.880
Why?

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.360
I don't get ideas like yours.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.120
So what? Write something else.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.280
Write about your childhood,
the river near your village...

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.360
The religious festivals,
the fairs...

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.120
All those things you've
told me about.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.080
Hush!
- Why?

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.040
I can't remember.
- Well, try.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.280
If you don't write,
my cousin will want a reason.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.640
A reason?

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.920
He'll think I'm not teaching
you anything.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.120
I see. So he told you.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.920
I mean, he didn't exactly...

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.480
appoint me as your regular teacher
with a monthly salary.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.600
Now where are you off to?

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.960
Time to arrange for tea.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.160
I am going to send in my essay.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.040
Go ahead.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.680
Deep within my heart is yearning...

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.920
Alas, alas...

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.680
I know not why...

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.880
Sister-in-law.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.920
On the roof.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.480
You can see the church
clock from there.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.120
Go and see.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.200
No.
- Then don't.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.600
You want another betel leaf?
- All right.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.880
Manda, what paper should I submit
my essay to? - What?

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.920
What paper should I
submit my essay to?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.840
Good Lord! How should I know?

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.680
That's why I am asking you.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.840
Those who do know can't
make up their mind.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.960
Answer quickly.
The Lotus or The Philanthrope?

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.080
The locust?
- Not locust. Lotus!

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.960
Quick, pick one.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.320
The Lotus!

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.520
You are right.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.720
The Philanthrope doesn't
publish new writers.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.760
But will they publish me?
- Yes!

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.760
Good.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.640
God bless you, dear Manda.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.600
Blessings aren't enough.
If I'm right, you owe me a treat.

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.280
Cake from Pelleti's or Sweets
from Bhim Nagar?

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.440
Ice-cream.
- What?

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.280
Ice-cream!
- So be it.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.480
You could've brought these in!
What if it had rained?

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.280
Amol.
- Coming, cousin.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.280
Amol has been writing these days.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.800
Have you read anything
he has written?

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.960
Charu?

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.920
Why?

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.720
I was just wondering if he
has any real talent...

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.080
or if he is just wasting his time.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.080
A very good offer of marriage
came for him from Bardhaman.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.120
Raghunath Mitra's daughter.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.200
Good.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.400
Cousin?
- Ah, there you are.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.600
I haven't finished proofing yet.
- Why?

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.120
I've been doing some writing myself.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.320
About what?
- Nothing much.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.760
Let me see it.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.680
You're going to read it?
- Yes. Bring it.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.400
Nothing gloomy, I hope.
- No.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.080
Bring it here.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.920
Go on. Run, run, run.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.520
A good bride.
Amol just has to consent.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.520
That's nothing.
He just needs a little coaxing.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.840
I am not sure coaxing...

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.600
Will you read it yourself or...
- No, read it to me.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.240
Sit down.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.800
Just a minute.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.360
Go ahead.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.080
Light of a Moonless Night.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.680
When I...

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.680
Hold it. What did you say?

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.600
Light of a Moonless Night.
- Light of a Moonless Night.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.960
So it's about starlight?
A scientific article?

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.800
No, cousin. I study literature.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.600
I can't write an astronomical
treatise.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.200
So there's no moon?

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.640
No.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.760
No stars either?
- No.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.080
No night either?

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.040
Yes, but not in a literal sense.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.640
And no light, in a literal sense?

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.840
Listen,
I think you should get married.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.760
Married?

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.640
There's a very good offer
from Bardhaman.

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.800
The daughter of a lawyer there,
Mr. Mitra.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.360
A good-looking girl,
and well-educated too.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.240
Just tell me if you are interested.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.080
He's interested, all right.
Plenty interested.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.160
How would you know? You don't
understand me or my writing!

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.400
I understand just fine.
- No, you don't.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.880
What's all this squabbling?

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.880
I haven't told you the most
important part yet.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.520
After the marriage...

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.080
Mr. Mitra intends to send his
new son-in-law to England.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.080
Sit down.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.880
Sit down and let that sink in.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.240
Suppose you came back a barrister
Would that be so bad?

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.160
Brother. Give it some thought.
It's nothing to sneeze at.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.800
England!

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.040
The land of Shakespeare.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.200
Why just Shakespeare?

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.280
Burke, Macaulay, Gladstone!

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.760
You could go hear them
speak in Parliament.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.680
Listen to their speeches in person!

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.680
I never got there myself.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.640
I regret it to this day.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.200
I got as far as getting
my passport once.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.160
The Isles of Greece.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.240
Exactly!

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.560
Why just England?
You'll see the continent.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.040
France. Germany.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.480
Greece. Italy!

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.280
The land of Mazzini and Garibaldi...

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.680
You will see it with your own eyes.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.080
How many young Bengalis
get such a chance?

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.160
Aren't you tempted?

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.120
Mediterranean.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.120
What a wonderful word!

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.280
Like the strains of the instrument.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.320
Mediterranean.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.120
Just imagine it, Amol.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.240
New Year's Eve.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.400
The last decade of the 19th century.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.960
The clock of Big Ben is striking.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.720
It's snowing.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.960
And you're walking
down the street...

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.400
in overcoat and gloves.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.560
The spirited demeanour
and confident strides.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.800
The Young Bengal!

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.680
How I wish I were in your place!

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.120
Well? Are you ready?

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.800
Mr. Amol Chandra Basu?

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.240
Brother?

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.400
Agreed?

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.320
"Rich with thy hurrying streams,
bright with orchard gleams."

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.480
"Cool with thy winds of delight."

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.600
"Dark fields waving."

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.400
Cousin.
- Yes?

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.440
No.
- What?

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.960
But why?

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.880
Long live my Bengal.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.280
Good night!

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.280
Hail Krishna!

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.600
What do I tell Mr. Mitra?
- Ask for some time.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.240
How long? A week?

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.840
A month!

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.160
Did you see that?
Why are you laughing?

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.400
Didn't I tell you he was interested?

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.160
He just won't admit it.
- You don't understand, Charu.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.240
An opportunity like this
won't come again.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.960
Don't worry.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.880
Do as he says and ask for some time.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.360
In a few days he'll
say yes on his own.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.040
You think I don't know your cousin?

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.920
Manda.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.240
Yes?
- Come here.

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.360
Tell me what you want.

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.040
Come here.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.160
"The sky is tilted with the
luster of the moon..."

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.480
Come here.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.760
A smile adorns it...

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.600
What?

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.760
Come close.
- I am close.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.840
Closer.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.480
Look at me.
- I am looking.

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.400
What?

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.520
You haven't been up to anything,
have you?

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.520
What if I have?

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.560
You drink on the sly, don't you?

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.840
My Mandakini.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.760
A good girl...

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.120
with a bad husband.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.080
What's all this about?

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.680
You don't think I am rotten?

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.960
Why should I think that?

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.120
Then who is?

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.440
It's our luck that's rotten,
having to leave our own home.

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.840
Why?

00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.680
Don't you like it here?

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.480
How could I? And besides...

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.880
Besides what?

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.640
Besides what?

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.440
No, nothing.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.880
Just two months more.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.320
Two months?

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.560
Just put up with it two more months.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.200
And then?

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.480
Then what?

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.800
What are you planning?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.320
Could you lie for my sake?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.360
Tell me how much you love me.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.600
Dear God! What kind of lie?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.560
All right. I will make it easy.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.480
I'll do the lying.
You just back me up.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.480
What are you up to?

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.520
You've to beat them
at their own game.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.520
You don't want betel leaf
if I prepare it?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.880
You won't have it?
- No.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.240
What is it, Braju?

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.880
A letter for you.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.320
I was listening to your song.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.120
Manda,
The Lotus is publishing my essay!

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.320
Really?
- Look at this letter!

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.920
Didn't I tell you?

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.880
Sister-in-law.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.680
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.240
Sister-in-law.
The Lotus accepted my essay.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.400
Stop that banging. I am busy.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.400
Cousin, The Lotus accepted my essay.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.320
Light of the Moonless Night?
- No. Dark of the Sun.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.080
Good.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.680
Stop that banging, I said!

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.120
Charu.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960
Charu.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.160
Just a moment.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.200
What's going on?

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.160
What's the matter?

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.320
A cockroach. If it gets away...

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.800
A cockroach?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.640
Where did it go?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.200
Maybe under the bed.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.320
Oh. In that case...

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.240
Big news An election in England.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.360
We are all very excited.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.280
The party in power now,
the Tories...

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.840
will never do India any good.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.640
So we all want the other party...

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.840
The Liberals, to win.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.920
Bipin says he'll offer a prayer for
them at the Kalighat temple.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.600
Here, take these keys.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.640
Smell this. Hot off the press.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.240
Tell me, who will win?
Dizzy or Gladstone?

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.880
What do you say?

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.600
Gladstone. Liberals.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.800
I bet Nishikanta 50 rupees.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.320
Good. Liberals. Gladstone.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.840
Charu.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.480
Want ice-cream?

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.960
Have some.
- No.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.440
Manda, ice-cream?

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.680
There's one extra.
- No.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.640
Why not?
- Makes my teeth ache.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680
Hey, cat...

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120
ice-cream?

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.600
Look.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560
Charu...

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.640
if I write something good but
it stays in your notebook...

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.440
nobody will ever see it,
and it'll never be printed.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.960
Doesn't that seem wrong?

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.720
Of course.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.440
You were wrong about my work.
I write very well, don't I?

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160
Of course.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.160
It's quite an honor for
a new writer, isn't it?

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960
Of course.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.040
Then from now on show me a bit
more respect, all right?

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.480
You are going out?

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.720
I want to go show my friends.

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.480
THE PHILANTHHOPE.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.960
The Cuckoo's Call.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.440
The Cuckoo's Lament.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.240
My Village.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.320
What?

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.960
Look!

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.720
Look!

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.560
You wrote this?

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.080
In The Philanthrope?

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.880
Too much lime in Amol's betel
leaf burns his mouth.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.440
I will prepare it from now on.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.440
Sister-in-law.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.960
You...

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.040
What are you doing?

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.120
What has come over you?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.160
Don't you realize how
well you write?

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.760
When I told you to write
about your village...

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.000
I never imagined you
could write so well.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.520
Believe me...

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.680
I am really quite amazed.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.960
So natural.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.360
So flowing!

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.440
You mustn't stop.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.760
You must keep writing.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.760
Otherwise, all your talent...

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.880
No,
I'll never write anything again.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.240
Never.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.440
Never again.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.240
Why are you crying?

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.640
Don't cry.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.440
You are right.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.000
How silly of me!

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.520
I got your shirt wet.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.600
To the Liberals!

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.920
To the Liberals!

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.520
Bhupati won his bet.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.440
And we are celebrating
with his winnings.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.680
I lost the bet...

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.320
but the money was originally mine.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.200
So who is the actual host?

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.520
Bhupati Dutta or Nishikanta
Chowdhury?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.720
And why should it be you?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.680
It was your father's
money originally!

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.280
Order, order!

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.360
Bhupati,
the musicians and singer are ready.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.600
What's the point of all
this useless talk?

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.440
Absolutely right.
There's no point at all.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.040
We will certainly have our music.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.040
But first...

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.080
I want to say something.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.320
We are celebrating today because
the Liberals won.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.280
And given the political situation
in India today...

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.400
It's our duty to do so.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.840
In my opinion...

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.080
there's one person we should
especially remember today.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.880
This celebration, The Sentinel...

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.040
and our political consciousness...

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.960
are all due to one person.
Raja Rammohan Roy.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.400
That's right.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.640
If not for him,
we wouldn't have cared...

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.440
whether the parliamentary
elections had been won...

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.800
by the Tories or the Liberals.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.320
That's why I think...

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.960
that our first and foremost liberal
of the 19th century...

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.320
should be remembered today.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.600
And now Joydeb will sing a
song he composed himself.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.520
I second Bhupati's proposal
with all my heart.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.680
But I too wish to say something.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.160
After this first song...

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.080
suppose we get a bit more liberal...

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.080
and listen to a Zappa by Nidhu Babu.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.960
We will ask our friend
Shashanka to sing it.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.080
Why me?

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.440
Go on now, Joydeb.

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.720
What are you thinking about?

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.000
Hey, Mr. Know-it-All.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960
About England?

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.160
Why did our great Raja
Rammohan Roy...

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.120
have to die in a foreign land?

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.200
In far-off Bristol.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.160
How many Bengalis will
ever see his grave?

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.800
You will.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.680
Will I ever go there?

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640
You will go.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.160
First to Bardhaman, then to Britain.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920
Right?

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.680
Well?

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.520
First Bardhaman...

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.680
then betrothal...

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.200
and then Britain.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.920
And then?

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.040
Then Bristol.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.640
And then a barrister.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.440
And then?

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.160
And then...

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.640
back to Bengal.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.120
Black native,
bolting from the British.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440
What do you think?

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.760
Bengal? Nothing better?

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.920
And Bankim.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.040
Babu Bankim Chandra.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.000
Byron to Bankim.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.960
Bishabriksha.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.560
But what about me?

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.360
O being celestial,
you who dwell in my house...

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.160
in the form of a witch.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.880
Am I so bad?

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.400
So beastly? So brazen.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.920
I bow before you...

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.640
Here.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.800
Why didn't you sing today?
You should have.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.320
You have such a nice voice.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.640
Charu?

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.160
We are leaving tomorrow.
- For where?

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.040
Manda received word that
her father's very ill.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.360
The money I borrowed.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.640
Does my cousin know you are leaving?

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.120
Yes, I told him.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.560
Besides,
I'll be back in a few days.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.640
Give him a hand, will you?

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.760
It's an early train tomorrow,
and we must pack.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.320
So good night.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.920
Manda.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.160
Send me the magazine
with your article.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.960
Manda.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:31.120
If nothing else,
I can read your name.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.360
This will make things
hard for my cousin.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.480
Why?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560
You are here.

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.680
What am I to manage the paper now?

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.440
That's right.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.320
Sit down. You are a captive.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.560
You'll stay as long as the
paper's in operation.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.400
Before this gathering breaks up...

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.880
I have a proposal.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.120
No, a complaint...

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.760
directed at the editor...

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:19.600
and owner of The Sentinel.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.480
In other words, our host tonight...

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.320
Mr. Bhupati Dutta.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.880
Our distinguished editor
is acting...

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.080
as if he doesn't know what
I'm talking about.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.360
May I first inquire...

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.680
as to whether you're acquainted
with this magazine.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.640
Or perhaps even read it?

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.200
No.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.400
You mean to say you haven't read...

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.480
the contribution on page 22...

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.920
of the current issue?
- No.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.720
Would you swear to that?
- Yes.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.680
Come straight out with it!

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.760
You sly devil!

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.880
Your wife's writing for
The Philanthrope...

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.320
and you keep it a secret?

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.560
I haven't seen it.
- Let me see.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.480
What does this say?
Mrs. Charulata Dasi!

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.080
This is Charu's writing?
- That's right.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.440
Girish Ghosh had better watch out.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.880
Bhupati rivals him as an actor.

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.720
This must be old.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.120
Sure! Prehistoric, right?

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.320
Is that so?

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.040
Congratulations.
- Hip, hip, hurray!

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.800
Hip, hip, hurray!

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.560
Hip, hip, hurray!

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.800
Hmm! Just sign here.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.400
Good.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.600
We will deliver your order
Wednesday morning.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.560
Fine. Good day.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.720
Yes?

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.760
What can I do for you?

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.240
What's the meaning of this letter?

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.720
That's from us.
- I know.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.960
Something wrong with the English?

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.320
You know very well what I mean.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.320
We owed you 2,700 rupees for paper.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.120
My manager paid you for
this in February...

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.760
Three months ago.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.840
So why this letter from your lawyer?

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.160
So your manager says
he paid that bill?

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.040
Of course.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.880
All 2,700?
- There must be some mistake.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.200
Where's your manager?
- Away at the moment.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.800
Cleared out, has he?

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:22.320
Tell me whatever you've
to say to him.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.560
What's there to say?

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.080
Doesn't he know how much he paid?

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.360
Oh, here it's.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.520
Look here. 300 rupees paid.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.760
And only after three reminders.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.640
See for yourself.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.560
What?

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:54.680
Here are copies of the letters.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:59.320
See for yourself.
It's all perfectly clear.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:07.120
We don't send out legal notices
without good reason.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:11.480
What would we gain by
losing our customers?

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:17.200
We are only here thanks to them.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.400
But we are running a business.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.360
We've to keep that in mind too,
don't we?

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.640
I mean, contact is important...
Very well. I'll look into this.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.320
But business is business.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.720
Sir!

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.400
You forgot your...

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.880
By the end of the month, all right?

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.080
He could get 100 rupees
just for that cane.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.880
These people!

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:46.440
Amol?

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.840
My cousin's never this late.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.600
Isn't he coming up?

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.240
I will go see.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.920
Amol.

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.560
Whatever happens...

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.960
promise me you won't go away.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:41.720
What could happen?
- Promise me.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.160
What are you afraid of?

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.240
Give me your word you won't leave.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.040
Promise me.

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.600
My cousin's back.
Let me go see what happened.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.480
Give me your word...

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.880
You won't leave!

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.960
Promise!

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.240
Let me go.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.600
Let go of me.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.720
Brother?

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.560
Have you ever seen the play
dead soldiers on stage?

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.320
There's one.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.040
They get up again when the
curtain comes down.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.080
But this one won't get up.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.720
My favorite smell.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.720
The smell of printing ink.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.360
Let's go.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.920
Someone so close to me!

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.960
My own relative.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.600
No, more than that...

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.680
A friend.

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.880
To think such a man would betray me,
Amol.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.080
It's not just the payments
he never made.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.360
He even took out loans in my name.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.440
I can't even tell you how
he exploited my goodwill.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.680
And I put all my trust in me.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.840
When it first dawned on me,
I was so stunned...

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.280
that my head reeled.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.160
I told Abdul to drive
along the Ganges.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.960
I felt like I was suffocating.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.240
It's not the money that upsets me.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.440
I will pay whatever's owed.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.680
But...

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.960
if this is how one man
treats another...

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.200
If a man I put such trust in shows
not the slightest respect...

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.920
then what have we got?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.120
How do we go on living?

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.920
Trust, faith.
Are these just empty words?

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.160
Is there no honesty?
Is it all just sham and lies?

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.320
Can you not even trust a man
who's so close to you?

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.560
How can people live
and work together?

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.440
It's been a terrible blow, Amol.

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:32.280
It feels like my whole
world is crumbling.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.320
What can I do to help?

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:39.040
You don't have to do anything,
my friend.

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:46.120
Just stay as you are, that's all.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.880
I've told you so much.

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.640
I can't tell Charu everything.

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.040
Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.400
Tell you what: Let's all go to
the seashore for a few days.

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.720
I mean it. Think it over.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.640
You know?

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.360
Yes.

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.680
Charu,
you wrote such a nice piece...

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.440
that got published in that magazine.

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.040
But you never showed me anything.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.600
When Nishikanta announced it
in front of everyone...

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.640
I was quite embarrassed.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.600
I felt very hurt.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.200
When could I tell you?

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.720
You are always so busy.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.640
I won't be busy anymore.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:31.080
I've gotten rid of your rival,
you understand?

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.440
Now I can give you all
the time in the world.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.320
Dear Cousin...

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.280
I believe I'd only be a further
burden to you...

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.320
If I stayed here under the
present circumstances.

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.000
I've learned of some
work out of town...

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.480
and I am going to see about it.

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:02.040
Best wishes to both of you.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.240
Amol.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.520
P.S.: Charu mustn't give
up her writing.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.480
Did you see this?

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:49.080
What is it?
- He is gone!

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.320
Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.520
Packed his things last
night and cleared out!

01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:59.120
He left a letter.
I don't want to be a burden.

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.040
As if he could ever be a burden!

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.000
What are you saying?
- It's the truth.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.720
Where are you going?
His room's empty.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:17.040
He had some of my proof sheets...

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.400
and I came to get them...

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.960
but he'd vanished!

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:25.240
You are right. He is gone.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.320
How strange!

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:29.480
Braju!

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.920
Braju! Braju!

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.920
Braju!

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:39.760
Are you deaf?
- I did answer, ma'am.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.760
Put away his bedding.
- Whose bedding?

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:46.480
Amol's! Whose do you think?
These old servants!

01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.920
Charu, you are angry.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.960
And I know you have reason to be.

01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:00.440
But just consider one thing.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.640
How responsible and
mature he's become.

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.440
He left out of concern for me...

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.680
Yet like a child he forgot
to say where he was going!

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.080
Silly boy!

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.960
I know perfectly well
where he's gone.

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:22.240
To Bardhaman.
Just make some inquiries.

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.800
Bardhaman?

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.320
That's a good one!

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:52.840
Charu.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.480
Yes?

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.600
No.
I can't say these things properly.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.720
Perhaps I should read some Bankim,
eh?

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.160
My first gray hair.

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.920
Charu...

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.120
won't you write some more?

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.240
You know why I like your
writing so much?

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:46.640
Why?

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.560
Because I understand it all.

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.120
I don't understand
what others write.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.480
Keep writing, Charu.

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.800
I will.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.960
Start your newspaper again
and I'll write.

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:03.320
You'll write for my newspaper?
Politics?

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.080
Why must it be politics?
- What else?

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.200
Can't a paper cover
more than politics?

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.520
Have politics in English and
all the rest in Bengali.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:21.920
You take care of the one,
and I'll handle the other.

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.000
What?
- Aren't I right?

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.800
That's a wonderful suggestion!
Brilliant!

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:36.680
I never thought of it.
- Can you manage?

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:50.320
If I can't manage alone,
Nishikanta can help.

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.080
Two people can do it.
- Three.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.160
Yes.
- The three of us.

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.280
Hurray!

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.840
Listen.
Let's not waste any more time here.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.960
They talk about the
roar of the waves.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.720
Yes. Nothing like the sound
of a printing press.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.760
Let's go.
- Where?

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.880
Come on.

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.120
Come.

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:33.680
I should've written Nishikanta
to come to the station.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.280
Then we could've discussed
our new plan.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.760
Put those down here, Braju.
It's easier to unpack.

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.880
Where's my bag of shells?

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:49.120
Would you like some tea?
Or some cool sherbet?

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.880
Now?
- You don't want anything?

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.880
I'd rather go see Nishikanta
right away.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:58.600
This minute?
- I won't be long.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:02.960
Now's best, before he gets
started on something else.

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.560
Moti Maa!

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.360
Have Braju bring up a copy
of The Englishman.

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.960
I haven't seen a paper in days.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.680
I wonder what's been going on.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.920
It's so hot!

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.400
Moti Maa!
- Coming.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.320
Bring some water. I'd like a bath.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.240
Charu.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.200
Did you call?

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.200
Amol is in Madras,
staying with a friend.

01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.280
Read it. It's good news.

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.000
Take it.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.960
I will be back.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.520
Amol, why did you go away?

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.560
Amol!

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.680
Why did you leave without a word?

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:45.560
Why didn't you tell me?

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:48.000
Amol!

01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:27.680
I've brought your water, madam.

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.120
All right.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.920
Dearest sister-in-law.

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.680
I am in Madras, at a friend's house.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:48.520
I am fine, but for a few days now...

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.920
the strains of the instrument
have been ringing in my ears.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.960
You may write to them in
Bardhaman if you wish.

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:58.200
Are you still trying to revive
the dead soldier?

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.640
My salutations to both of you.

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.080
Yours, Amol.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.760
Braju?
- Yes?

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:04.800
Light the lamps.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.280
Come in.

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.760
Come in.
