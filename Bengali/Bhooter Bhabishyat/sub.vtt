00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:51.443
-Henna?
-Yes?

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:54.526
-Can you fix my hair?
-Okay.

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:04.443
Hi! What's up?

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.235
I'm at a shoot.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.526
No, I can talk.

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:11.318
They're setting up the lighting.
Just a minute.

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:16.485
It's an old house in North Calcutta.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:19.318
"Lingering Doubt".

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:24.693
Come on, not lingerie! 'Lingering'...okay?

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.193
It's a serious film, dude!

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:29.693
Today?

00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.693
No, there's a premiere party today.

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.443
As if your picture never gets printed on page 3!

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:38.443
Tomorrow?

00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:40.485
Hold on...

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:42.235
-Henna?
-Yes?

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.693
-Please hand me my diary.
-Yes.

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:46.985
Ma'am, the shot is ready.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:52.401
You are admiring the necklace
in front of the mirror.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.235
The trolley will follow you.

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:55.818
You should look quite happy and mushy.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.818
-Shall we go for a rehearsal?
-Yeah, yeah, please.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:58.818
Trolley.

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:00.818
Silence!

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.818
Go on, go on...that's it.

00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:04.318
This is the last mark.

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:06.026
-Okay?
-Yes.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:06.401
DIRECTOR: DEBABRATA RAY.

00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:08.318
"Lingering Doubt"
Scene 12, shot one, take one.

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:10.818
Action!

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.068
Hey hey, hey!

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.068
-What happened?
-Get some water!

00:02:29.193 --> 00:02:31.276
Welcome back after the break.
I'm Shonali...

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:36.026
Bringing you hot news and gossip
from the world of entertainment...

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:37.901
on your favorite program Shooting Star.

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:42.526
A very strange incident took place last week
during the shooting of the film "Lingering Doubt."

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:47.818
The lead actress of the film Madhumita
suddenly fainted in the middle of a shot.

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:54.318
Apparenly, she saw the reflection of an
unfamiliar woman in the mirror.

00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:56.443
Who was this mysterious woman?

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.568
Did Madhumita see a ghost?

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.318
PRESENTED BY SATYA FILMS
AND MOJO PRODUCTION

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:06.318
ANIK DUTTA'S MOTION PICTURE

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.026
THE FUTURE OF THE PAST

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:19.610
Excess in the name of progress

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:23.276
Bulldozers are razing all the old houses

00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:25.276
Gone, gone, everything's gone

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:30.526
High rises, multiplexes and shopping malls

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:34.110
Promoters are taking over all the land

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.568
Calcutta is now a concrete jungle

00:03:37.693 --> 00:03:41.026
Heritage is disappearing fast

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.818
As the old houses disappear

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.235
ghosts are in great trouble

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.943
No one is concerned about them

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:02.526
The future of the ghosts is doomed

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:05.860
Silent are the intellectuals

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.443
The civil society is also indifferent

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.276
The administration is quiet

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.610
Same with the media and the opposition

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.276
No hunger strikes or demonstrations

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.943
Because ghosts are not voters

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:34.485
Where will all the ghosts go?

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:38.151
This film was made to protest against all this

00:04:59.526 --> 00:05:01.901
There, park in front of that gate ahead.

00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:12.568
What a house!

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.651
But it's not that well-maintained.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.068
That's what happens
with disputed properties.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.568
But I guess they've renovated the interiors
since people shoot films here.

00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:27.443
It's been closed for almost a year.

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.860
Remember the Madhumita incident?

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.610
Which incident?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.943
Oh, the "ghost" affair?

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:36.068
Just imagine!

00:05:36.193 --> 00:05:37.651
Yeah, Sudhir?
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:38.860
This is Nantu speaking.

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:41.276
Yes, we've already reached.

00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:46.485
Sir, we production managers are
extremely punctual.

00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:47.985
Let me see.

00:05:48.318 --> 00:05:50.776
Okay, we'll wait.

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:53.776
Is Madhumita going
through such a PR crisis?

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.943
Why such cheap publicity?

00:05:56.068 --> 00:05:57.776
Well, whatever it was, it worked.

00:05:57.985 --> 00:06:00.151
Check out the TV channels, newspapers...

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.110
Ghosts intrigue everyone!

00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:04.610
It's great for publicity.

00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:06.360
Hence, the popularity
of ghost stories!

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.693
Yes, numerous films too.

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:12.943
But what about the caretaker?

00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:15.610
He is just about to reach.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.943
A round of tea, meanwhile?

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.985
A shop nearby makes awesome tea.

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:21.901
We'll do all that later.

00:06:23.068 --> 00:06:25.610
Is that your caretaker "framing" in?

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:26.901
Yes.

00:06:27.735 --> 00:06:28.735
Good morning, sir!

00:06:28.735 --> 00:06:29.485
Good morning.

00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:30.693
Let me introduce you guys.

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:31.776
This is Sudhir...

00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:32.776
a very amiable person.

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:34.485
He's in charge
of the Chowdhury House.

00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:37.193
This is Ayan... Ayan Sengupta.
Our director.

00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:38.068
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:39.735
What films have you made, sir?

00:06:40.026 --> 00:06:42.235
Haven't made a feature film yet.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:43.401
I make ad films and stuff.

00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:44.026
Commercials.

00:06:44.026 --> 00:06:45.235
Oh, commercial films?

00:06:45.318 --> 00:06:46.860
No, ad films...

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.151
The ones that come
in between TV shows.

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:50.110
Oh... Publicity.

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:52.110
This is Rinka,
our assistant director.

00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:53.068
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:58.026
What a waste of such an enormous house.
Almost all of it is locked up.

00:06:58.068 --> 00:07:00.485
Just take a look inside,
the space is amazing!

00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:03.818
This house is
over 250 years old!

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.943
Wow!

00:07:04.943 --> 00:07:05.901
Are ceremonies still performed here?

00:07:06.068 --> 00:07:07.485
Yeah, sort of.

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:09.818
Used to be quite an ordeal earlier.

00:07:09.943 --> 00:07:12.485
Family members would come
from all over.

00:07:12.818 --> 00:07:15.443
Everybody would be
in festive spirits.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.901
The best artisans
would make the idols.

00:07:19.276 --> 00:07:23.235
Hundreds would feast for days.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.735
Theatre... music...
every evening!

00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:29.776
Now we do as much as we can.

00:07:29.943 --> 00:07:34.985
Otherwise, it would have been sold
a long time ago.

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:36.860
Only if Sumit had arrived...

00:07:36.943 --> 00:07:38.693
- Are you expecting anyone else?
- Yes.

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.401
Our DOP, Sumit Ray.

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:41.485
D...DOP?

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:42.151
Cameraman.

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:43.735
- Oh.
- Our cameraman, Sumit Ray.

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:46.568
What kind of place
are you really looking for?

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.318
This house is quite spread out...

00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:51.443
Inner palace...

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:52.943
Outer palace...

00:07:53.193 --> 00:07:54.026
Prayer room...

00:07:54.443 --> 00:07:57.443
- Kitchen...
- What we actually need is a verandah.

00:07:57.485 --> 00:07:57.943
Oh.

00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:02.151
It would be great
if the flooring is checkered.

00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:04.235
But it'll be great
if it's a little less run-down.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.360
You'll find it in the new palace.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.818
Great!

00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:13.360
Darpa Narayan Chowdhury had built it
to entertain English guests.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.818
Really?

00:08:13.818 --> 00:08:17.151
This old section was constructed
about 50 years before that.

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:19.151
That's the prayer room.

00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:20.901
Come.
This way.

00:08:23.526 --> 00:08:26.110
I love wandering
around these old houses.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.068
It's rather thrilling.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.818
I would like to take a tour
of the entire house.

00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.693
I'm here for about an hour.

00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:40.818
- We'll cover a lot on the way up.
- Good.

00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:42.276
- Come, Rinka.
- Hmm.

00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:49.776
Watch your step.

00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:51.901
Check out the stain glass work?

00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:52.860
Yeah, it's fantastic.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.235
You won't get these nowadays.

00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:59.360
This new portion has been repaired
and painted for shooting purposes.

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.860
The architecture here is quite different.

00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:04.651
Yes.

00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:12.818
These aristocratic houses are an eclectic
hotchpotch of architecture from various periods.

00:09:14.193 --> 00:09:15.568
This side is pretty interesting.

00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:18.651
- Let us take a look at that side.
- Yes, let's.

00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:21.443
- We'll take the shots here, okay?
- Okay.

00:09:21.651 --> 00:09:22.860
- Hold on to these.
- Sure.

00:09:27.318 --> 00:09:31.193
The actor will be resting
on a recliner...

00:09:32.776 --> 00:09:35.776
- Right here, okay?
- Okay.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.860
We'll get the entire depth
at the back.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.735
And the shadow of the railing pattern
on the floor will be superb!

00:09:41.776 --> 00:09:42.401
Nice.

00:09:42.401 --> 00:09:44.985
Your laptop has the script
and the storyboard.

00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:45.901
Should I switch it on?

00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:49.485
It's all stored in my head.

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:50.901
Once Sumit gets here...

00:09:51.485 --> 00:09:53.068
we'll finalise the shot divisions.

00:09:53.318 --> 00:09:53.985
Okay.

00:09:54.276 --> 00:09:55.901
Listen, we still have 15 minutes.

00:09:56.776 --> 00:09:58.318
Let's check out the rest
of the house.

00:09:58.776 --> 00:10:00.610
You go ahead, I'll be right there.

00:10:00.818 --> 00:10:02.818
These people will do anything
for publicity!

00:10:02.818 --> 00:10:04.943
Nantu, don't gossip!

00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:05.651
Sudhir...

00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:07.651
Let's complete our "conducted tour".

00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:08.610
Yes... Let's go.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.651
Ayan, I was actually telling him
about that case.

00:10:22.443 --> 00:10:25.360
After the rumour about the ghost...

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.110
people come here a lot less
to shoot films.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.901
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:29.610
It's good in a way.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.943
The house belongs
to 12 ghosts!

00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:33.318
Nobody gets paid directly
in any case.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.193
It's directly despoited
with the arbitrators.

00:10:36.193 --> 00:10:38.276
And that's used to pay the taxes
of this house.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.818
Are you sure
the ghost stories are rumours?

00:10:41.818 --> 00:10:45.318
There must be a few
in such an old house!

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:47.485
- Well said!
- You don't say!

00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:49.068
It's definitely haunted.

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:54.568
The founder of this palace
couldn't enjoy it for very long.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.193
Oh!

00:10:55.193 --> 00:10:57.151
I've heard from my ancestors...

00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:03.443
Once he had arranged
for a dance extravaganza...

00:11:03.526 --> 00:11:06.735
and was instantly titled
the "Raibahadur"

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.651
Let's go.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.068
Rinka...

00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:10.610
Yes, coming.

00:11:11.693 --> 00:11:12.735
Let's check out that side first.

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:13.943
Here, take this.

00:11:14.193 --> 00:11:16.568
You can smoke
in front of others!

00:11:16.568 --> 00:11:20.485
Don't roam around
in this haunted house!

00:11:20.485 --> 00:11:21.401
That's crap.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.943
Check out the hall.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.068
Just amazing!

00:11:31.193 --> 00:11:34.193
Is this a hall or a music room?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:38.693
Yes, dancers used to perform here...

00:11:39.276 --> 00:11:45.360
a lot of famous artistes.

00:11:46.485 --> 00:11:48.735
- Let's move on.
- Yes.

00:11:50.693 --> 00:11:52.985
- That matter's settled, right?
- Yeah, it's not an issue.

00:12:00.693 --> 00:12:02.985
You're yawning a lot...

00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.651
Were you out late last night?

00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:05.943
Not exactly...

00:12:06.943 --> 00:12:09.610
I stayed up working
on my storyline.

00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:13.776
I have a meeting with a producer tomorrow
about the feature film.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.818
Really? That's great!

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:17.985
Don't get excited yet.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.693
Let's see if the producer likes it.

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:22.860
You're going to make something artsy,
I'm sure.

00:12:23.193 --> 00:12:24.776
What makes you say that?

00:12:25.318 --> 00:12:29.818
Do you know what my film guru,
Satyajit Ray, has said?

00:12:30.318 --> 00:12:32.610
"Film is the highest form
of commercial art".

00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:35.985
A producer is going to spend tons
of money...

00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:40.860
I can't make an esoteric film.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.776
I want to make a film
which I'll enjoy watching myself.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.276
Ayan, how about a ghost movie?

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.485
There hasn't been a good Bengali one
in ages. The public will--

00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:53.443
You've settled the money matters I hope.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.443
That won't be a problem.

00:12:55.443 --> 00:12:59.026
I've given him a lot of work before.
We go way back. Don't worry.

00:13:00.943 --> 00:13:03.485
Try and get the work done
by evening.

00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:05.943
You won't find anyone
after seven o'clock.

00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:09.735
The ghosts might be a nuisance
in the middle of the shoot!

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:10.610
No way.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.401
We'll start real early.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.651
I just can't get Sumit
on the phone.

00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:17.193
Apparently, he's
in an unserviceable area.

00:13:17.485 --> 00:13:19.610
He should have been here by now.
Normally, he isn't late.

00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:22.776
Relax. I'll try again.

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:23.568
Yes, try.

00:13:24.651 --> 00:13:27.776
Rinka, let's get on
with the work.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.860
We should finish the detailed list
of furniture and props.

00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:35.318
There are quite a few
antique pieces here.

00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:39.693
We need a recliner
and a marble-top coffee table...

00:13:39.943 --> 00:13:43.193
and tea in bone china cups.

00:13:44.401 --> 00:13:45.985
Talking about tea...

00:13:45.985 --> 00:13:47.943
I think we could do
with some right now.

00:13:48.651 --> 00:13:50.276
Nantu, tea break!

00:13:50.818 --> 00:13:52.568
Okay, okay.
That's alright.

00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:56.026
I got through Sumit, finally.

00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:59.193
His train was late
and there was no network coverage.

00:13:59.193 --> 00:13:59.860
Oh...

00:13:59.943 --> 00:14:05.026
Our camera man is directly coming
from an out-of-town shoot.

00:14:05.026 --> 00:14:06.026
The train is a little late.

00:14:06.026 --> 00:14:07.193
Hope you're not
in a hurry?

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:08.443
In fact, I am.

00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:11.235
There's a hearing in the High Court
regarding this house.

00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:13.485
I've been given the
Power of Attorney.

00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:14.568
I have to go.

00:14:14.568 --> 00:14:17.485
This work is killing me!

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.735
Maintaining this house is not easy!

00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:23.901
Why don't you rent it out
for TV shows?

00:14:24.193 --> 00:14:26.901
Currently, two period dramas
are being filmed.

00:14:26.901 --> 00:14:28.735
I'm handling the production
for one.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.360
Excellent pay!
Monthly contract.

00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:33.735
Who cares?

00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:35.901
I doubt this house will last very long.

00:14:35.901 --> 00:14:37.985
The promoter is just waiting
for his chance.

00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:40.901
Any day now the house
will be broken down.

00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:44.110
Weren't you saying
that this house has a story?

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:45.235
You bet it does!

00:14:45.526 --> 00:14:47.026
A unique history.

00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:48.860
This is a cursed house...

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.610
Cursed from day one.

00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:54.985
The landlord Darpa Narayan Chowdhury
had earned the title of "Raibahadur"...

00:14:55.568 --> 00:14:57.568
shortly after the Sepoy Mutiny.

00:14:57.651 --> 00:14:59.235
After 1857?

00:14:59.401 --> 00:15:00.068
Yes.

00:15:00.818 --> 00:15:02.485
On his way to collect revenue...

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:05.068
he got killed by bandits.

00:15:06.193 --> 00:15:10.026
He could not enjoy the palace
that he had built himself.

00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:11.235
Who knows...

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:16.276
Maybe his discontented soul roams
around the corners of this house!

00:15:17.193 --> 00:15:18.235
Jesus!

00:15:20.776 --> 00:15:22.568
Hello...
Hello?

00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:24.568
Yes, tell me...
Hello?

00:15:25.776 --> 00:15:26.568
S**t, it got disconnected.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.026
Spook call?

00:15:28.068 --> 00:15:31.068
No... Sumit was trying to call.

00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:34.068
Ayan, please change this ring tone.

00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:36.276
Man... I got so startled!

00:15:36.443 --> 00:15:36.860
Really!

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.151
Such a spooky ring tone!

00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:40.068
Hmm...

00:15:40.318 --> 00:15:44.318
I would never have made films
if it were not for this spooky spirit.

00:15:45.068 --> 00:15:46.110
Do you know whose voice this is?
Satyajit Ray.

00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:50.901
Yes, Sumit, I can hear you.
Tell me.

00:15:51.276 --> 00:15:52.068
Yeah.

00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:54.110
What?

00:15:55.318 --> 00:15:56.401
Rail blockade?

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.110
- Oh, s**t...
- Not again...

00:15:59.068 --> 00:15:59.943
Where?

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:01.651
Bhringigram?

00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:04.610
Bhringigram as in Nandi-Bhringi?

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:06.651
Against land acquisition?

00:16:06.693 --> 00:16:08.610
What do we do now?

00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:11.401
The shoot is on the day after.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.568
It won't be possible tomorrow.

00:16:12.568 --> 00:16:14.443
I have a very important meeting.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.860
You'll come by car?
Will you get one?

00:16:19.485 --> 00:16:21.568
How long will it take you?

00:16:22.943 --> 00:16:25.860
Two hours?
But we need to...

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.735
Okay, I'll try
to get permission.

00:16:29.818 --> 00:16:31.943
Give me a call once you leave.

00:16:33.568 --> 00:16:37.526
Can you leave the keys
with someone?

00:16:37.985 --> 00:16:39.485
There was a security guard.

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:41.193
But the ghosts scared his away.

00:16:41.276 --> 00:16:43.193
I'm the sole keeper now.

00:16:43.443 --> 00:16:45.318
There is a family
of heirs living behind.

00:16:45.318 --> 00:16:46.985
But they take no responsibility.

00:16:47.276 --> 00:16:51.360
The house is stuffed with antiques...
How come it's left empty?

00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:54.443
The most valuable items are actually
underneath the house.

00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:55.318
Hidden treasure?

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.776
According to rumours, pitchers filled
with gold coins are planted underneath.

00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:01.360
Hidden treasure?

00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:03.151
Wow!

00:17:03.568 --> 00:17:08.943
Gold coins from the British era were discovered
while fixing the water pipes.

00:17:12.818 --> 00:17:13.610
Yes, tell me.

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:16.610
Got it? Brilliant.

00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:17.901
Truck?

00:17:18.735 --> 00:17:19.776
Wow!

00:17:20.985 --> 00:17:22.026
Okay, come over.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.401
I'm here, waiting.

00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:26.068
Call me
if there's a problem.

00:17:26.235 --> 00:17:27.360
Okay, great.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.235
Sir, I'm sure you can understand
that we are stuck.

00:17:31.235 --> 00:17:34.818
I understand
but how can I wait?

00:17:34.943 --> 00:17:36.193
It's a court matter, you know.

00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:40.193
Could you please rely on me
and give me the keys?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.943
I'll take full responsibility
and drop it off at your place.

00:17:43.026 --> 00:17:44.193
I promise.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.651
This puts me in a real fix.

00:17:46.693 --> 00:17:51.568
Sir, we go such a long way back.
I've done so many shoots here.

00:17:51.651 --> 00:17:55.443
Sudhir, if you could be a little considerate...

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:56.485
Sir, please!

00:17:57.151 --> 00:17:58.151
Okay, fine.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.026
Close all the doors and windows
after you are done.

00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:04.901
- Then drop off the keys at my place.
- Yes.

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:06.693
It's a huge responsibility.

00:18:06.693 --> 00:18:08.401
Don't worry at all, sir.

00:18:08.485 --> 00:18:09.693
I'm giving you my word.

00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:11.693
I'll drop off the keys safely
at your house.

00:18:11.693 --> 00:18:12.568
Sanguine!

00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:13.943
Come, I'll explain everything to you.

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:15.985
- This is for the front door.
- Front door.

00:18:16.443 --> 00:18:19.235
Close all the doors and windows
before leaving, okay?

00:18:19.235 --> 00:18:24.235
Don't mention anything about the shoot
if any random people come by.

00:18:24.526 --> 00:18:26.276
There are those heirs I mentioned...

00:18:26.276 --> 00:18:27.985
They are real troublemakers!

00:18:28.818 --> 00:18:30.235
No... There won't be any problems.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.610
Be rest assured.

00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:33.610
- Okay...so long.
- Yeah.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.610
- Okay, sir, thank you.
- Okay.

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:41.193
Just like the Sikhs are known
for their fearlessness...

00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:43.943
and the Gorkhas for their loyalty...

00:18:43.943 --> 00:18:49.776
Bengalis are well-known
for troublemaking!

00:18:50.235 --> 00:18:52.401
This is why they've gone
to the dogs.

00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:53.526
Oh, s**t!

00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:56.568
I have to be
at the police station by noon.

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:59.235
Need to get permission
for the next shoot.

00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:00.068
You get going then...

00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:00.985
Just hand me the keys.

00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.193
Here are the keys.

00:19:03.693 --> 00:19:05.193
- So, it's clear?
- Yes.

00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:07.235
You'll manage by yourself?

00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:08.735
Do something...

00:19:08.735 --> 00:19:10.276
You guys take the car.

00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:11.610
I'll take a cab
on my way back.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.110
It'll take me a while
to go home and come back.

00:19:15.318 --> 00:19:17.693
It's better I work
on the synopsis here.

00:19:18.068 --> 00:19:19.110
What's the story?

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:20.651
Have I heard it?

00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.526
I think I told you once sketchily.

00:19:22.818 --> 00:19:24.651
It's about this guy
who plays in a band...

00:19:24.818 --> 00:19:25.651
Oh...

00:19:25.776 --> 00:19:30.193
His parents are very ambitious...
want him to become a doctor or an engineer.

00:19:30.485 --> 00:19:31.193
Yup.

00:19:31.401 --> 00:19:34.026
He... He starts taking drugs
or something like that.

00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.485
I've added a new angle to it.

00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:39.568
His girlfriend has a different crisis.

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:40.485
Hey...

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.068
If you start listening to the whole story,
there will be a crisis on the day of the shoot.

00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:45.943
- Come on, let's get going.
- Let's go.

00:19:45.943 --> 00:19:47.443
I have to go to the dresser.

00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:48.610
Leave this here.

00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:50.651
You...

00:19:50.693 --> 00:19:52.735
- You'll remember to take it?
- Hmm.

00:19:52.735 --> 00:19:53.860
- Sure?
- Absolutely.

00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:55.693
- By the way...
- Hmm?

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.068
Won't you feel scared
all alone in this haunted house?

00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:03.943
No ghost can come near him
with rum by his side!

00:20:04.068 --> 00:20:05.151
What?

00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:08.860
I had an overnight shoot
the day before yesterday.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.276
You know I am
quite a fan of rum.

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:13.776
So, I can't do
without a drink or two.

00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:15.318
I still have half a pint left.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.235
Do you want to keep it?

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.485
You can take a quick swig
if you feel scared.

00:20:20.068 --> 00:20:21.651
I won't need it, thank you!

00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.110
I have some green.

00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:25.068
Oh!

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.235
- Really...you guys!
- Come on, now.

00:20:27.276 --> 00:20:28.235
- Let's go.
- Bye.

00:20:28.235 --> 00:20:29.943
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:22:13.693 --> 00:22:14.443
Oh!

00:22:25.026 --> 00:22:26.568
THE BATTLE OF PLASSEY

00:22:26.568 --> 00:22:27.485
Hmm!

00:22:52.318 --> 00:22:53.401
Yes, Sumit?

00:22:53.693 --> 00:22:54.360
Where are you?

00:22:55.651 --> 00:22:56.568
Oh God...

00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:58.568
It's still a matter
of one and a half hours, then.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.026
Okay, I'll wait.

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:03.818
This house is really interesting.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.068
I'm exploring the surroundings.

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.693
You can't imagine the kind of things
that are scattered around.

00:23:09.193 --> 00:23:11.443
An old edition of "The Battle of Plassey"
by Nabinchandra Sen...

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:16.526
a newspaper from 1971
that covers the death of a Naxalite leader...

00:23:16.943 --> 00:23:18.818
I'm in a complete time warp!

00:24:21.401 --> 00:24:22.276
Who's there?

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.151
I live here.

00:24:25.276 --> 00:24:25.943
Oh.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.901
Sudhir mentioned, in fact.

00:24:27.985 --> 00:24:28.610
Huh!

00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:29.860
What does he know?

00:24:30.443 --> 00:24:31.318
How come you're here?

00:24:31.318 --> 00:24:32.026
Alone?

00:24:32.693 --> 00:24:35.151
I'm here for some work.

00:24:35.401 --> 00:24:37.568
Waiting for someone.

00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:38.568
Shooting?

00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:41.318
Yeah...

00:24:41.485 --> 00:24:43.401
So, what's your film like?

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.943
Social or commercial?

00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:50.401
Or is it one of those intellectual, art films?
With messages and all!

00:24:51.568 --> 00:24:52.985
No. None of those.

00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:56.610
I was into films too,
at one point in time.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.360
Really?

00:24:57.443 --> 00:24:58.860
I was a member
of the Cine Club.

00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:01.443
Fellini, Truffaut, Bergman...

00:25:01.735 --> 00:25:04.360
And our very own Satyajit,
Ritwik, Mrinal...

00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:05.193
Just brilliant!

00:25:05.401 --> 00:25:06.526
What films they made!

00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:09.360
I see that you're a real film buff.

00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:11.276
What about contemporary film makers?

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:14.110
Such as Wong Kar Wai,
Tarantino, Almodóvar...

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.401
You must have seen their works?

00:25:16.151 --> 00:25:19.735
Unfortunately, I haven't been able
to watch films recently.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.776
So, what's your film like?

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.985
Mine is merely a film
on requisition.

00:25:25.693 --> 00:25:26.568
Ad film.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.026
Oh, for advertising?

00:25:30.026 --> 00:25:30.943
Yes, indeed.

00:25:31.068 --> 00:25:32.943
Slavery of consumerism!

00:25:33.276 --> 00:25:34.485
Commodity fetishism!

00:25:35.276 --> 00:25:38.026
The entire country is now filled
with brazen bourgeoisie.

00:25:38.943 --> 00:25:41.193
You yourself mentioned Satyajit Ray...

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.068
He was also
from the world of advertising.

00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:49.151
See, if we don't advertise
salt and soap, how will we survive?

00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:51.651
And who exactly will produce
my independent film?

00:25:52.276 --> 00:25:52.901
Is that so?

00:25:53.526 --> 00:25:55.360
So you actually are interested
in making a feature film.

00:25:55.526 --> 00:25:56.943
Definitely.

00:25:57.651 --> 00:25:59.318
In fact, I have a story
in mind too.

00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:01.443
It's called "Badly Bangali".

00:26:01.776 --> 00:26:04.610
In fact, I'm meeting a producer tomorrow.

00:26:05.443 --> 00:26:06.610
Great, so let's hear it!

00:26:06.901 --> 00:26:08.068
If you don't mind, of course.

00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:09.526
No, why should I mind?

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:13.235
The basic story revolves
around a guy.

00:26:13.568 --> 00:26:15.110
The guy plays in a band...

00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:16.901
- So--
- Band?

00:26:17.651 --> 00:26:18.443
Marching band?

00:26:19.526 --> 00:26:20.068
No.

00:26:20.776 --> 00:26:23.860
Band...as in a music group.

00:26:24.818 --> 00:26:25.943
Like The Beatles?

00:26:27.318 --> 00:26:29.985
Yes, but they play Bengali music.

00:26:31.068 --> 00:26:32.735
Bengali band?

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.443
Bit of an oxymoron.

00:26:35.943 --> 00:26:37.235
Interesting, carry on.

00:26:37.526 --> 00:26:38.151
Yeah...

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:47.110
The guy's parents want to realise
their unfulfilled aspirations through their son.

00:26:47.818 --> 00:26:51.360
Now, this guy just can't relate
to any of this.

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:55.068
He is unable to compose songs.

00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:57.943
He's in a sort of non-creative limbo.

00:26:58.568 --> 00:27:05.901
And his girlfriend's parents want
to marry her off to a well-settled guy.

00:27:07.151 --> 00:27:08.735
Old wine in a new bottle.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.068
What happens in the end?

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.235
That's the problem.

00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:15.610
I just can't figure it out.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.651
I have introduced a number
of new characters...

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:22.193
Brought in a lot
of plot points...

00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:25.318
There are crises, cinematic moments...

00:27:25.318 --> 00:27:27.651
But I can't figure out the resolution.

00:27:27.735 --> 00:27:30.068
I must come up
with something by tomorrow.

00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:34.151
I have a tremendous story
for a film.

00:27:34.443 --> 00:27:36.110
I was really into all this long ago.

00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:38.443
Try me out.
It might just work for you.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.485
Interested?

00:27:40.235 --> 00:27:41.735
Hmm, why not?

00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:46.443
A story idea is always welcome.

00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:51.026
Besides, I'm stuck here
for at least an hour and a half.

00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:53.735
What can be a better pass-time
than a story, hmm?

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.943
Then let's start the story
with a smoke.

00:27:57.943 --> 00:27:59.026
Let's go.

00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:00.526
Here you go.

00:28:00.735 --> 00:28:01.860
No thanks, I have mine.

00:28:02.026 --> 00:28:05.318
But...
Do you still get that brand?

00:28:06.235 --> 00:28:09.026
The old houses of Calcutta
are vanishing rapidly.

00:28:09.651 --> 00:28:13.318
 From the two-century-old houses
of North Calcutta...

00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:16.276
to the Art Deco houses
of South Calcutta...

00:28:17.318 --> 00:28:19.276
The thrust of "progress"
has knocked them all out.

00:28:19.276 --> 00:28:23.401
From British rule to self rule,
we have now come to the rule of the promoters.

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:26.693
They'd break down the Writer's building
to make a sever-star hotel if they could.

00:28:28.026 --> 00:28:30.735
Every day there's
a new condomonium...pandemonium!

00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:33.943
Multiplexes and shopping malls
are springing up everywhere.

00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:36.985
Only the heritage buildings...

00:28:37.193 --> 00:28:39.901
And the properties
with succession dispute are left.

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:43.776
Although, they are very few in number
and in a run-down condition.

00:28:44.068 --> 00:28:47.193
Now the question is,
who are in trouble here?

00:28:48.318 --> 00:28:49.276
Bengalis?

00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:50.985
I mean, the middle-class Bengalis...

00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:55.318
who are being forced
to move to the outskirts?

00:28:55.443 --> 00:28:56.110
No...

00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:58.068
That problem was always there.

00:28:58.943 --> 00:29:04.276
The demolition of these old houses
has caused trouble for the spirits of the city.

00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:05.360
Hmm?

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:06.401
- Spirits?
- Hmm.

00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:11.485
Oh, you mean the old Calcutta spirit?

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:12.401
No, sir.

00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:15.068
By spirits, I mean ghosts.

00:29:15.193 --> 00:29:16.151
Ghost.

00:29:16.443 --> 00:29:17.401
Spirit.

00:29:17.776 --> 00:29:19.193
They are in utter ruins.

00:29:19.818 --> 00:29:21.026
Are you serious?

00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:22.235
Absolutely.

00:29:23.026 --> 00:29:26.401
All these old, abandoned houses
of Calcutta were the hub of these ghosts.

00:29:26.818 --> 00:29:27.735
Some were famous places.

00:29:28.026 --> 00:29:32.610
Like the old radio station
at Gurstin Place, the National Library, etc.

00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:36.943
These and other abandoned houses
were the refuge of the ghosts.

00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:39.776
Today, those ghosts are
in dire crisis.

00:29:39.943 --> 00:29:41.276
Today, they are homeless...

00:29:41.693 --> 00:29:46.776
moving from one haunted house
to the other.

00:29:47.193 --> 00:29:52.526
The few houses that remain are not enough
to accommodate them all.

00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:57.401
Yet, nobody seems to be bothered
during this dark hour of the ghost society.

00:29:57.485 --> 00:29:59.526
The government isn't bothered
about rehabilitating them.

00:29:59.568 --> 00:30:01.235
There are no rehabilitation packages.

00:30:01.526 --> 00:30:04.776
There are no demonstrations in protest.

00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:06.568
The politically aware are also quiet.

00:30:06.776 --> 00:30:09.901
Processions, candle light vigils...
Nothing!

00:30:10.026 --> 00:30:11.610
Ruling party, opposition...

00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:12.860
Us, them...

00:30:13.318 --> 00:30:15.193
The civil socity, the erudite...

00:30:15.568 --> 00:30:17.360
Everyone's indifferent.

00:30:17.401 --> 00:30:18.860
The media couldn't care less.

00:30:19.026 --> 00:30:19.860
Beacuse...

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.068
Viewership does not depend
on ghosts.

00:30:22.693 --> 00:30:23.818
Right...

00:30:24.068 --> 00:30:26.651
Because they are not consumers
or voters.

00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:27.276
Hmm.

00:30:27.485 --> 00:30:30.901
At such a critical juncture,
the story begins.

00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:33.318
It's actually based
on this Chowdhury residency.

00:30:33.443 --> 00:30:34.068
Hmm.

00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:37.151
I sense a political satire.

00:30:37.568 --> 00:30:41.860
But I don't believe
in delivering an overt message.

00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:44.693
I like somewhat layered films.

00:30:44.693 --> 00:30:46.568
No... My story has many layers.

00:30:46.568 --> 00:30:47.318
Hmm?

00:30:47.318 --> 00:30:49.485
And it has enough
commercial ingredients as well.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.985
Crime, passion, thrill,
romance, music and dance.

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:55.151
They make for
quite an entertaining pot-boiler.

00:30:55.193 --> 00:30:55.985
Really!

00:30:57.318 --> 00:30:59.193
Let's hear it.

00:30:59.985 --> 00:31:05.026
The story begins
with Darpa Narayan Chowdhury.

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:06.985
I think Sudhir was talking about him.

00:31:07.026 --> 00:31:07.693
Yes.

00:31:07.735 --> 00:31:10.776
Having impressed an Englishman,
he had just received the title of "Raibahadur".

00:31:10.985 --> 00:31:13.151
It was the festive season.

00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:13.693
Okay.

00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:15.068
The religious rituals had begun.

00:31:15.443 --> 00:31:16.485
On such a day...

00:31:25.068 --> 00:31:25.943
Greetings, Master.

00:31:26.401 --> 00:31:27.193
Master?

00:31:27.193 --> 00:31:27.651
Hmm?

00:31:27.735 --> 00:31:29.235
Back in the village, they're saying...

00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:31.068
That...

00:31:31.068 --> 00:31:31.985
What?

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:32.985
What?

00:31:32.985 --> 00:31:33.485
They are saying...

00:31:33.651 --> 00:31:35.901
They can't pay their taxes
because the birds have eaten all the grains.

00:31:35.901 --> 00:31:36.443
Oh.

00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:37.193
Huh?

00:31:37.318 --> 00:31:38.151
Are you serious?

00:31:39.151 --> 00:31:41.318
In that case, who will pay
the government their dues?

00:31:41.318 --> 00:31:42.693
My forefathers?

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:48.443
- Keeping taxes due is not a good deed...
- No...

00:31:48.443 --> 00:31:50.401
Stop the drums!

00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:51.693
Stop it now!

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.318
The birds have eaten up the grains,
how will the taxes be paid?

00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:55.651
Bishe!

00:31:56.193 --> 00:31:58.651
Get the carriage ready.
Get it ready!

00:31:59.193 --> 00:32:01.193
Bunch of scoundrels!

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.110
Let me get back from the village.
You'll be fired then.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.068
- You rascal, get the carriage out!
- Get it ready!

00:32:09.235 --> 00:32:11.151
Will I reach tomorrow?

00:32:11.151 --> 00:32:12.068
Yes, Master.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.443
The carriage will take you to the village
and then you can take a palanquin.

00:32:32.693 --> 00:32:33.943
Why did you stop?

00:32:33.943 --> 00:32:36.276
We have to cross this dangerous forest
by evening.

00:32:36.276 --> 00:32:37.693
Why's everyone silent?

00:32:37.693 --> 00:32:40.401
All of you have to visit the loo together?
Let's get going.

00:32:40.568 --> 00:32:41.526
You'll get a reward--

00:32:43.151 --> 00:32:44.068
Who's there?

00:32:46.901 --> 00:32:48.901
Who are you?
What do you want?

00:32:48.943 --> 00:32:50.860
- They call me the "Noshu" bandit.
- Hmm!

00:32:52.193 --> 00:32:54.068
We are devils personified!

00:32:54.776 --> 00:32:56.943
- Do you know I'm "Raibahadur"?
- We sure do!

00:32:57.193 --> 00:32:59.193
That's why you're loaded!

00:33:00.443 --> 00:33:01.860
Beware!

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.568
Save me, dear Lord!

00:33:03.568 --> 00:33:06.151
Give us everything you have
if you want to save your life.

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:09.985
Each and every penny, or else...

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.235
Please let me go.

00:33:11.235 --> 00:33:14.276
There's no point crying.
Hurry up and hand over all you have.

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:18.068
I think I'm going to faint.
I better flee.

00:33:23.943 --> 00:33:25.110
After losing his life this way...

00:33:25.276 --> 00:33:28.943
Chowdhury's spirit bagan
to haunt various houses.

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:34.568
He finally settled
in his very own Chowdhury Palace.

00:33:47.985 --> 00:33:50.485
There was another house like this
called Imperial Palace.

00:33:51.318 --> 00:33:53.610
It was just after the partition
of Bengal.

00:33:54.318 --> 00:33:56.860
Sir Ramsay used to stay there.

00:33:57.693 --> 00:34:00.610
The way he showed off,
one would think he was the viceroy himself!

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.818
And that's precisely
what brought him down.

00:34:02.818 --> 00:34:08.735
Is the name "Ramsay",
by any chance, inspired by the Ramsay brothers?

00:34:08.735 --> 00:34:09.818
You've got it!

00:34:09.943 --> 00:34:12.735
I had seen one of their film posters
when I was at college.

00:34:12.735 --> 00:34:13.401
Mhmm.

00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:16.151
"Honeymood of the Ghosts"
with the caption...

00:34:16.151 --> 00:34:19.193
"Mountain of Corpses, Fountain of Blood,
Danger, Danger, Danger"!

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.610
Sir Ramsay had gone
to the riverside for some fresh air.

00:34:28.776 --> 00:34:30.985
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:37.526
On that very day, Viceroy Lytton had planned
to be there in his Phaeton.

00:34:45.026 --> 00:34:50.818
Mistaking Sir Ramsay for the Viceroy,
freedom fighter Putiram Ghosh threw a bomb at him.

00:34:50.818 --> 00:34:52.443
Hail Motherland!

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.693
Despite his accidental death...

00:34:59.693 --> 00:35:03.860
Sir Ramsay's ghost continued living
at the Imperial Palace flamboyantly.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.693
But his happiness did not last long.

00:35:07.318 --> 00:35:12.360
A government office was set up there.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.610
Sir Ramsay was in a deep dilemma.

00:35:15.318 --> 00:35:17.151
- Hello, Mr. Booth.
- Good morning.

00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:18.318
- Good morning.
- You've got to help me out.

00:35:18.318 --> 00:35:21.360
He got hold of his predecessor,
the ghost of Sir Booth...

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.443
(telephone conversation)

00:35:22.443 --> 00:35:23.943
at an old cemetary.

00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:34.985
Sir Wilkes Booth recommended him
to a trusted native landlord.

00:35:35.985 --> 00:35:38.776
Excuse me, who is the landlord?

00:35:38.776 --> 00:35:41.526
- I am the landlord, sir.
- I see, you are the landlord.

00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:45.568
- Yes, I am, sir.
- Oh, it's you that Booth told me about.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.943
Oh yes. Yes sir.

00:35:48.151 --> 00:35:50.485
I'm so fortunate
that Sir Booth recommended me!

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.651
Come sir, come.

00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:53.693
You're my master,
I'm your servant.

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:56.235
Booth sir calls me Darpa.

00:35:56.443 --> 00:35:57.610
"Darpok",
meaning coward?

00:35:57.735 --> 00:35:58.943
No, no. Darpa, sir.

00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:01.068
Oh, Darpa.
Like Firpo?

00:36:01.235 --> 00:36:04.360
- What does that mean?
- Darpa as in obedient, sir.

00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:05.693
Darpa Narayan Chowdhury...

00:36:05.693 --> 00:36:08.735
- Your most obedient servant, sir.
- Oh, I see.

00:36:08.735 --> 00:36:10.568
Come, sir.
Come in.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.526
Ramsay was welcomed
with great cordiality by Darpa Narayan Chowdhury.

00:36:14.526 --> 00:36:16.110
Now let's come to the Forties.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:17.068
Alright.

00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:23.901
Keshab Narayan Chowdhury was the black sheep
of the Chowdhury family...

00:36:24.235 --> 00:36:27.860
Wine, women, races, gambling...
He had done it all.

00:36:28.193 --> 00:36:32.110
At last, after falling for a film actress named
Kadalibala, he invested in films.

00:36:32.193 --> 00:36:33.401
Kadalibala?

00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.443
Doesn't kadali mean banana?

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:36.401
So what?

00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:38.818
Angurbala can be a name derived from grapes
then why not Kadalibala from bananas?

00:36:38.818 --> 00:36:40.485
- Are bananas that bad?
- Not at all.

00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:47.151
Besides, people go bananas
over actresses!

00:36:48.318 --> 00:36:49.110
Anyway...

00:36:49.568 --> 00:36:52.610
There was no playback singing
at the time.

00:36:52.943 --> 00:36:55.943
And Kadalibala was famous
for her singing.

00:36:59.943 --> 00:37:10.693
I won't give you my heart, won't give it,
won't give it away

00:37:12.443 --> 00:37:16.735
If you want my heart,
Remember this my friend

00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:20.860
If you want my heart
You will have to pay for it

00:37:20.943 --> 00:37:25.360
You won't get it for free
Won't get it for free at all

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:34.985
I won't give you my heart, won't give it,
won't give it away

00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:36.110
Cut.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:36.860
Very good.

00:37:37.235 --> 00:37:39.568
You won't get it for free...

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.776
I'm not asking it for free...

00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:46.610
This bracelet, the ring on your nose,
the earrings you're wearing...

00:37:46.776 --> 00:37:49.443
Have I gifted you all of it
for nothing?

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.193
Moreover, I'll sign the company papers
in your name, Kadalibala.

00:37:54.526 --> 00:37:56.235
I love you madly.

00:37:56.818 --> 00:37:59.735
I don't want your property, Keshab.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:04.068
Just make me your wife...

00:38:04.276 --> 00:38:07.985
and grant me a place
at your feet.

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:12.068
Have patience, Kadali.
I'll marry you soon.

00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:16.776
Oh, stop!

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.026
Stop the car.

00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:21.235
Why did you bring me here, Keshab?

00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:23.110
This is your country house!

00:38:23.318 --> 00:38:26.110
Stay here for now.
I'll marry you soon and take you home.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.568
Don't forget me,
I beg of you.

00:38:29.735 --> 00:38:30.901
Don't worry.

00:38:31.735 --> 00:38:33.360
Keshab Narayan did not keep his word.

00:38:33.818 --> 00:38:36.735
Thirty-three months went by
but Keshab didn't keep his word.

00:38:37.318 --> 00:38:39.860
He kept making excuses.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.818
Kadalibala was aging.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.526
Her film career was
also almost over.

00:38:45.068 --> 00:38:47.110
And then she found out...

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:54.193
that Keshab Narayan was getting married
to the daughter of an aristocrat.

00:38:54.901 --> 00:38:59.818
Humiliated and heartbroken,
Kadalibala hung herself.

00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:04.568
Where she was unable to walk
into as a bride during her lifetime...

00:39:04.985 --> 00:39:09.401
Her tormented spirit took shelter
in that very house.

00:39:19.068 --> 00:39:28.693
You didn't return, my love
You had given me your word

00:39:28.693 --> 00:39:38.276
You didn't return, my love
You had given me your word

00:39:38.276 --> 00:39:47.860
I'm all alone, grief-stricken
Time doesn't seem to pass by

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:52.193
You didn't return, my love

00:39:57.485 --> 00:40:07.151
Life didn't bring us together
Maybe death will some day

00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:16.193
Life didn't bring us together
Maybe death will some day

00:40:16.693 --> 00:40:26.276
I stare at the road, waiting
Singing my song of grief

00:40:26.276 --> 00:40:35.901
I'm all alone, grief-stricken
Time doesn't seem to pass by

00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:45.485
You didn't return, my love
You had given me your word

00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:54.860
I'm all alone, grief-stricken
Time doesn't seem to pass by

00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:02.068
You didn't return, my love

00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:08.193
As interesting as the story sounds,
the production design will be really difficult.

00:41:08.193 --> 00:41:12.693
We need to do thorough research
in order to recreate the various time periods.

00:41:12.693 --> 00:41:14.943
- Props, furniture, costumes, everything--
- No, not at all.

00:41:14.943 --> 00:41:18.276
A film about ghosts
does not require so much research.

00:41:18.276 --> 00:41:21.110
I'll shoot Darpa and Ramsay's scenes
in a sepia tone.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.610
And Kadalibala's scenes
in black and white.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.860
Back projection, direct lighting.

00:41:25.026 --> 00:41:29.193
Each character will have dual shadows, cast
on a hand-drawn backdrop of the sky.

00:41:29.193 --> 00:41:31.151
We can play around
with the grey scale!

00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:31.776
Good!

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.526
That means my story has managed
to excite your grey cells.

00:41:36.776 --> 00:41:38.235
Now, cut to Calcutta
in the Seventies.

00:41:39.526 --> 00:41:40.401
Those were times
of unrest.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.026
Radio Peking announced the
thunderous roar of the youth.

00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:49.276
A time when young men were being
indiscriminately killed the police.

00:41:56.943 --> 00:41:57.985
This...

00:41:57.985 --> 00:41:59.610
we'll capture
on a handheld camera.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.568
Jerky movements.
Like Mrinal sen.

00:42:01.568 --> 00:42:03.360
A-la "Calcutta '71".

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.943
It was the survival
of the fittest in Kolkata.

00:42:06.026 --> 00:42:08.860
Corpses of young men
were being recovered everywhere.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.401
Several political leaders were being killed
in mock encounters.

00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:15.860
On such an encounter,
a guy called Biplab Dasgupta got killed.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.318
Incidentally, he was the nephew
of this family.

00:42:18.485 --> 00:42:21.985
Although he always looked down
upon his bourgeoisie uncle's family...

00:42:22.276 --> 00:42:25.401
he ended up in this house
after detah.

00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:29.693
And there would be frequent quarrels
between him and Darpa Narayan.

00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:31.235
Very interesting.

00:42:31.235 --> 00:42:35.276
It's not only people from various
socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds...

00:42:35.276 --> 00:42:37.026
but there are people
from different time periods too.

00:42:37.026 --> 00:42:38.693
Truly an ensemble cast.

00:42:38.735 --> 00:42:39.943
Not just them...

00:42:40.276 --> 00:42:48.568
As more old houses were razed,
more ghosts were drawn to this one.

00:42:48.818 --> 00:42:50.943
In fact, it was getting difficult
to accommodate everyone!

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:51.901
Goodness!

00:42:51.901 --> 00:42:54.235
So, how was the accommodation crisis
of the ghosts resolved?

00:42:54.235 --> 00:42:56.318
- An interview board was set up.
- Ah!

00:42:56.318 --> 00:43:01.318
Only those who passed the interview
would be allowed to stay in the house.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.443
There were candidates
from all over the world.

00:43:04.443 --> 00:43:06.776
They spoke diverse languages
and dressed in various attires.

00:43:06.943 --> 00:43:14.943
(indistinct)

00:43:14.943 --> 00:43:17.443
Why does he constantly
keep greeting me?

00:43:17.943 --> 00:43:21.443
There's a great offer
on sub-zero fridges, sir.

00:43:22.151 --> 00:43:24.651
The sub-zero agenda
is affordable cooling.

00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:28.360
Keep this card.
I'll give you good discounts.

00:43:28.568 --> 00:43:29.568
Next!

00:43:31.693 --> 00:43:32.985
Hello, sir.

00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:35.401
I am Khaja Khan.

00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:37.985
I have fought
in the Battle of Plassey.

00:43:38.193 --> 00:43:40.360
You were a warrior?
Despite your frail frame?

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.401
I was a special chef for the great monarch
of Bengal, Siraj Ud-Daulah.

00:43:44.401 --> 00:43:45.318
Wow!

00:43:45.401 --> 00:43:48.360
We'll get to feast on royal food!
Can you make kebabs?

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.151
Yes, sir.
Kebabs, Biryani, Chaap, Musalam...

00:43:51.776 --> 00:43:52.860
So, how did you die?

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.193
I wasn't a traitor.
I refused to side with Mir Zafar.

00:43:55.193 --> 00:43:57.401
I sacrificed my life
for my king.

00:43:57.776 --> 00:43:59.526
When everybody began
to betray...

00:43:59.526 --> 00:44:01.568
I put down my kitchen knife
and picked up the sword.

00:44:01.568 --> 00:44:04.401
I hate the British!

00:44:04.568 --> 00:44:06.568
Is he talking about us?

00:44:06.568 --> 00:44:08.776
Yeah...
Praising you!

00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:11.776
I used to live
in a palace at Murshidabad.

00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.735
They built a museum there...

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:16.110
I became homeless.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.568
Let him stay.

00:44:17.568 --> 00:44:21.068
We'll get some good food.
Although, I have gastric problems.

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:23.776
Next!

00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:25.401
My name is Shapan Dey.

00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:27.860
I was in sales
at a multinational company.

00:44:28.693 --> 00:44:30.318
You know a sales person's life...

00:44:30.318 --> 00:44:33.443
Convincing clients, reaching targets,
getting incentives...

00:44:33.735 --> 00:44:35.235
My income wasn't bad.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.985
I took a bank loan
to buy an apartment with a garage.

00:44:39.401 --> 00:44:42.235
Then of course, I had to buy a car
and pay big installments.

00:44:42.235 --> 00:44:44.068
I got three or four credit cards.

00:44:44.068 --> 00:44:47.568
My wife Ratna is a shopaholic.

00:44:47.943 --> 00:44:50.985
I would be busy with my work.
Didn't notice all that.

00:44:50.985 --> 00:44:53.943
All of a sudden,
my company began downsizing.

00:44:54.068 --> 00:44:55.235
I lost my job.

00:44:55.568 --> 00:44:57.568
I was in huge debt.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:04.568
The credit card company sent goons
who insulted me in front of my son.

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:08.651
Unable to take the humiliation...
I jumped in front of a subway train.

00:45:08.651 --> 00:45:11.193
There's no credit
in keeping credit!

00:45:11.193 --> 00:45:12.735
No vacancy.

00:45:12.735 --> 00:45:13.901
Next!

00:45:14.485 --> 00:45:16.651
My name is
Bhooth Nath Bhaduri.

00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:19.776
I came from East Bengal as a refugee
after the 1942 riot.

00:45:19.776 --> 00:45:21.735
India and Pakistan weren't
yet separate countries.

00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:24.985
I built a house on Jadavpur Colony
by the railroad.

00:45:24.985 --> 00:45:27.735
I had lost all my land
and property back at home...

00:45:27.735 --> 00:45:31.235
and so, had to work as a salesman
of antacid pills on trains.

00:45:31.276 --> 00:45:33.068
I was killed
by a running train.

00:45:33.068 --> 00:45:35.943
I took shelter
on top of a tree.

00:45:36.068 --> 00:45:37.776
But I suffer from arthritis.

00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:40.026
It became really painful for me
to climb the tall tree.

00:45:40.026 --> 00:45:44.026
Besides, the trees were being chopped off
to build highways.

00:45:44.151 --> 00:45:46.235
There's no place left
for a ghost anymore!

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.485
I lived as a refugee
when I was alive...

00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:50.526
Nothing's changed after death.

00:45:50.526 --> 00:45:55.693
He's a quack... It might be good
to have him around.

00:45:56.026 --> 00:45:56.943
Thank God!

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.318
Next!

00:45:58.318 --> 00:46:02.818
I'm a poor man, sir. I lived
in Darbhanga district. My name is Atmaram...

00:46:02.818 --> 00:46:04.651
Atmaram Pasowan.

00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:11.401
I used to pull rickshaws in Calcutta
and would sleep on the sidewalk at night.

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:16.026
On the English New Year's eve,
I was sleeping in my usual place...

00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:22.651
Suddenly, a rich man's son was drunk
and drove his SUV right onto the sidewalk.

00:46:22.693 --> 00:46:24.401
And instantly your spirit was set free
from your body!

00:46:24.401 --> 00:46:26.818
But how would a poor guy
like me know?

00:46:26.818 --> 00:46:30.610
The sidewalk I used to live on
was first obstructed by a sign board...

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.651
and later, a flyover.

00:46:32.985 --> 00:46:38.568
I have nowhere to go, sir.

00:46:38.568 --> 00:46:41.026
We don't have our carriages here...

00:46:41.026 --> 00:46:43.360
We could get some fresh air
with him around.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.026
Yes, sir.

00:46:44.026 --> 00:46:45.110
Next!

00:46:45.443 --> 00:46:47.776
Brigadier Yudhajit Sarkar.

00:46:47.943 --> 00:46:49.360
Awarded the Dharamveer Chakra,
an Indian bravery award.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.526
Posthumous.

00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:56.068
In the year 1999...

00:46:56.526 --> 00:47:01.776
the enemy forces were continually bombing
from the other side of the LOC.

00:47:01.776 --> 00:47:06.735
We had already reclaimed a large part
of the Dras and Batalik sectors.

00:47:06.735 --> 00:47:11.485
We were carrying re-enforcements
for our troops in a convoy.

00:47:11.485 --> 00:47:14.776
Suddenly, we were shelled.

00:47:14.776 --> 00:47:18.776
I'm a martyr of the Kargil War.

00:47:19.068 --> 00:47:23.151
Later I found out that the government
was doing some scam with our coffins!

00:47:23.151 --> 00:47:27.276
I think he's the best person
to look after the security of this mansion.

00:47:27.276 --> 00:47:29.985
Hmm, these are dark times.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.610
Thank you, sir.

00:47:33.193 --> 00:47:34.485
My name is Pablo.

00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:38.193
No, not Picasso or Neruda.
Patranobis. Pablo Patranobis.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.901
Both my parents are very competitive.

00:47:39.901 --> 00:47:41.860
One's an engineer
and the other a doctor.

00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:45.526
They had tried to realise their
unfulfilled aspirations through me.

00:47:45.526 --> 00:47:46.485
Didn't work.

00:47:46.485 --> 00:47:49.485
I love music.
Had a band of my own.

00:47:49.485 --> 00:47:53.110
We had released an album too.
Only 13 CDs were sold.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:54.901
A lot of money was wasted.

00:47:54.901 --> 00:47:56.526
I was suffering
from serious depression.

00:47:56.526 --> 00:47:58.943
Even attempted suicide twice.

00:47:58.985 --> 00:48:01.610
Started suffering from writer's block.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.443
I couldn't write lyrics
or compose melodies.

00:48:04.818 --> 00:48:05.985
Then the usual...

00:48:05.985 --> 00:48:07.401
I started taking drugs.

00:48:07.401 --> 00:48:10.776
In small doses at first
but it gradually increased.

00:48:10.776 --> 00:48:14.651
Unknowingly, I overdosed on heroine.

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:19.360
When the high subsided, I saw my cold body
lying flat with cotton wool stuffed in my nose.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.235
While I wrote songs about how life sucks,
life itself turned away from me!

00:48:23.943 --> 00:48:26.985
I think it would be nice
to have a musician amongst us.

00:48:26.985 --> 00:48:28.860
What do you say, Darpa?

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:36.443
At one point, so many renowned musicians
from all over the country would perform here.

00:48:36.443 --> 00:48:38.985
This kid is a musician.
Let him stay.

00:48:38.985 --> 00:48:39.943
Thanks.

00:48:42.026 --> 00:48:43.901
Nanook, Nanook.

00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:47.151
What's this! A fur coat in this heat?
Is he mad?

00:48:47.151 --> 00:48:49.360
Nanook...

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.985
"Mr. Nanook from Alaska.

00:48:50.985 --> 00:48:54.568
"The haunted igloos have all melted
due to global warming.

00:48:54.568 --> 00:48:57.110
"The Eskimos have come
to know that...

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.985
"Calcutta is a dying city.
That's why he wants to stay here.

00:49:01.026 --> 00:49:02.443
I didn't understand a thing!

00:49:02.443 --> 00:49:04.151
Nanook, Nanook.

00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:06.485
No, we can't keep you here.
You stink.

00:49:06.485 --> 00:49:08.110
You'd better find a place
in the hills.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.068
Hi! My name is Koyel.

00:49:10.235 --> 00:49:14.568
You must have heard about my dad.
Famous industrialist, O.K. Dhar.

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:19.735
From iron rod dealerships to I.T. companies,
he owns it all from hardware to software.

00:49:19.735 --> 00:49:22.735
Last year he was also honoured
with the title of "Best Bengali".

00:49:22.735 --> 00:49:24.901
And I was Daddy's darling.

00:49:24.901 --> 00:49:26.651
He spoilt me with everything.

00:49:26.651 --> 00:49:29.735
I even had a chauffeur-driven car
of my own!

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.443
I had put on some weight...

00:49:32.526 --> 00:49:35.818
So I joined the gym.
That's where I met Sam.

00:49:35.818 --> 00:49:36.651
Who?

00:49:37.276 --> 00:49:39.151
- My gym instructor.
- Oh.

00:49:40.026 --> 00:49:43.568
Man, what a bod!
And really charming.

00:49:43.985 --> 00:49:47.860
I fell in love.
What wonderful moments we had!

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.526
We went out for three months
after which people at home found out.

00:49:52.526 --> 00:49:55.860
That was it!
No more going out. They stopped it all.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.193
They even confiscated my mobile phone.

00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:00.276
But I was adamant.

00:50:00.276 --> 00:50:03.651
I would only marry Sam Gonzalez.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.151
They tried tempting me
with a lot of things.

00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:12.110
When nothing worked,
they made Sam disappear!

00:50:12.526 --> 00:50:16.526
I know exactly how ruthless Dad can be.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.318
They thought that's
how they would sort everything out.

00:50:19.735 --> 00:50:21.151
But they are very stupid.

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:22.776
Stupid and heartless.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.485
But when I jumped
off the tenth floor, everyone cried a lot.

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:29.526
God!

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.693
Especially Dad.

00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:35.943
I feel really sorry
for the girl, sir.

00:50:36.401 --> 00:50:39.818
She reminds me
of my grand daughter.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.401
She died of black fever.

00:50:42.693 --> 00:50:44.735
That girl was my pet.
Let her stay.

00:50:45.276 --> 00:50:48.193
She's a charming young lady.
She must stay.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.818
The interview session ended.

00:50:50.818 --> 00:50:55.068
With such a strange ensemble of ghosts,
Chowdhury Palace became a zoo!

00:50:55.068 --> 00:50:57.651
Hey, Atmaram!
Where the hell are you?

00:50:57.651 --> 00:50:59.068
Bring out your rickshaw quickly!

00:50:59.068 --> 00:51:01.485
We have to go
to the market to buy fish.

00:51:01.485 --> 00:51:03.776
- Hey, Atmaram!
- Who is it?

00:51:03.776 --> 00:51:06.026
You are an absolute disgrace
to the society of ghosts!

00:51:06.026 --> 00:51:08.235
Sleeping at night.
Very bad!

00:51:08.235 --> 00:51:10.443
I'm not sleeping, sir.
Just resting a little.

00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:13.818
Let's go.
We have to go to the market!

00:51:14.735 --> 00:51:17.610
- To the market? This early?
- How is this early?

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.193
It's the crack of dawn.
Hurry up!

00:51:20.776 --> 00:51:22.526
We'll get good Hilsa fish today.

00:51:22.526 --> 00:51:24.026
Hilsa from the Padma river!

00:51:24.026 --> 00:51:26.151
We'll steam it with mustard.

00:51:27.193 --> 00:51:29.026
What a feast!

00:51:30.776 --> 00:51:33.193
I'll eat Hilsa
after ages!

00:51:33.693 --> 00:51:35.735
A ghost going to the market
to buy fish?

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.443
I've heard that they just extend their hands
and steal fish from the baskets!

00:51:39.443 --> 00:51:40.943
Why will they need to 'buy' it?

00:51:40.943 --> 00:51:43.401
They are 'Bengali' ghosts after all.

00:51:43.443 --> 00:51:44.818
Nostalgia...

00:51:44.818 --> 00:51:48.526
They have this compulsive need
to bargain with the fishmongers.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.443
- Anyway, they got the shopping done.
- Hmm.

00:51:50.443 --> 00:51:56.235
Hilsa fish, spinach, different kinds of herbs...
Everything had been arranged for!

00:51:56.693 --> 00:52:00.818
The taste of Hilsa
from my Padma River is incomparable!

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:03.818
- Stop...you'll cross the front gate!
- Pardon, sir?

00:52:03.818 --> 00:52:06.443
Nonsense!
You lack common sense!

00:52:06.443 --> 00:52:09.068
Thank God you are now past tense!

00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:10.610
Sir, I'm a poor guy...

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.443
Now take that thing out
from in between the legs.

00:52:13.443 --> 00:52:13.985
What?

00:52:13.985 --> 00:52:16.401
Oh... God...
Why are you just staring at me?

00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:18.985
Take that thing out
from between the two legs.

00:52:18.985 --> 00:52:20.318
God! No...

00:52:21.151 --> 00:52:25.068
Not your thing!
Take my shopping bag out.

00:52:25.068 --> 00:52:26.360
- Quickly!
- Yes.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.235
Okay.

00:52:28.526 --> 00:52:29.985
Now go straight up.

00:52:30.026 --> 00:52:31.943
I've gone up way before, sir.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.776
Sentimental talk, huh?
Like a Bengali romantic novelist?

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.943
What I mean is the second floor.
Go to the kitchen.

00:52:40.568 --> 00:52:42.485
Doesn't understand anything.
Idiot!

00:52:42.568 --> 00:52:44.735
Let's see what I can do
with the fish and mustard--

00:52:44.735 --> 00:52:47.193
Hey! You bloody villager!

00:52:47.401 --> 00:52:50.401
You low caste man!
How dare you come up here?

00:52:50.401 --> 00:52:53.443
You are a Brahmin.
How can you give a low class guy such liberty?

00:52:53.443 --> 00:52:55.526
What about you allowing
non-Hindus into your house?

00:52:55.526 --> 00:52:58.068
All that's okay with you, huh?
Your only problem is with this guy!

00:52:58.068 --> 00:52:59.693
Biplab is right.

00:52:59.735 --> 00:53:03.276
You're still stuck
with a feudal mentality.

00:53:03.776 --> 00:53:05.651
How can you believe in caste
and creed in the 21st century?

00:53:05.651 --> 00:53:09.776
That mentor of yours, Biplab...
He never believed in God or ghosts.

00:53:09.776 --> 00:53:12.485
Look at him today;
he himself has turned into a ghost!

00:53:12.485 --> 00:53:15.526
Biplab has managed to justify ghosts
with his applied physics.

00:53:15.818 --> 00:53:18.193
He doesn't believe
in charms and amulets.

00:53:18.776 --> 00:53:20.735
And he certainly doesn't believe
in casted-based discrimination.

00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:22.235
There's a song...

00:53:22.818 --> 00:53:24.360
Stop it!

00:53:24.943 --> 00:53:27.901
A donkey's braying
sounds more pleasant!

00:53:28.693 --> 00:53:30.818
I have lost my life once...

00:53:30.818 --> 00:53:33.651
I think I'll lose it again
after listening to your music!

00:53:33.985 --> 00:53:35.735
There's nothing called culture here.

00:53:35.735 --> 00:53:38.401
That's why I don't gel with anyone
apart from Biplab.

00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:40.151
Everyone's sense of music is absolutely--

00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:42.985
What you are singing, isn't melody.
It's cacophony!

00:53:43.443 --> 00:53:45.235
If you must sing,
sing a proper song.

00:53:45.235 --> 00:53:48.610
And here I thought there would be some
Indian classical music in the house!

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:50.151
It's the exact opposite!

00:53:50.776 --> 00:53:52.443
I had a neighbour
when I was alive.

00:53:52.443 --> 00:53:53.610
Just like you.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:54.860
A cranky, old man.

00:53:55.235 --> 00:53:56.985
He always objected
to our jamming sessions.

00:53:56.985 --> 00:53:57.776
Heart problem apparently...

00:53:57.776 --> 00:53:59.318
Said we were crossing the decibel limit.

00:53:59.318 --> 00:54:01.360
He had even filed a FIR.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.693
There's no relief even after death!

00:54:02.693 --> 00:54:10.443
Tell me something...
Can you sing Indian folk songs?

00:54:10.526 --> 00:54:14.776
Why do you need
to sing foreign songs?

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:17.151
Sing patriotic songs...

00:54:17.235 --> 00:54:20.901
Perhaps the National Anthem.

00:54:20.901 --> 00:54:22.276
- National Anthem, huh?
- Yeah.

00:54:22.276 --> 00:54:24.776
You'll be shocked
to hear the remixed version!

00:54:24.776 --> 00:54:26.360
Anyway, songs don't have
a national boundary.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.610
From Santana to Sufiana...
A song is a song.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.026
One should love it all.

00:54:30.026 --> 00:54:32.735
Music is a universal language.
It's like...you know...

00:54:35.568 --> 00:54:37.943
- He's started again!
- Where the hell did he go?

00:54:37.943 --> 00:54:44.235
Are you into Western music?
I'll play some of our music.

00:54:44.235 --> 00:54:45.151
Come on.

00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:54.235
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind

00:54:54.235 --> 00:55:03.276
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne

00:55:03.276 --> 00:55:12.610
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:23.485
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

00:55:24.568 --> 00:55:29.568
Memories of the olden days
How can they be forgotten?

00:55:29.568 --> 00:55:34.776
Oh, those good old days!

00:55:34.776 --> 00:55:38.568
How can they be forgotten?

00:55:47.026 --> 00:55:49.526
There are no shopping malls around.

00:55:49.776 --> 00:55:53.693
I want this house.
First class property!

00:55:54.068 --> 00:55:58.860
Th-This is a very disputed property, sir.
Very problematic.

00:55:58.943 --> 00:56:00.026
Problematic?

00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:02.026
What are you there for?

00:56:02.026 --> 00:56:05.360
And that lawyer is absolutely useless too.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.776
He just extorts money!
I just need this house.

00:56:08.776 --> 00:56:13.985
It'll be very risky!

00:56:13.985 --> 00:56:18.943
I don't care.
We have to get this house in six months.

00:56:25.844 --> 00:56:28.011
God! What's that smell?

00:56:28.178 --> 00:56:29.886
Eeks! It stinks!

00:56:30.094 --> 00:56:31.094
What is it?

00:56:32.428 --> 00:56:33.719
Have you ever had poppy seeds
at home?

00:56:33.719 --> 00:56:35.719
- Yeah.
- Poppy, not pasta.

00:56:35.886 --> 00:56:38.219
Potato curry with mashed poppy seeds?

00:56:38.219 --> 00:56:39.344
This is the same thing.

00:56:39.803 --> 00:56:41.636
Poppy in a different form.

00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:43.178
It stinks.

00:56:43.386 --> 00:56:46.428
You sing Bengali songs really well!

00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:51.344
- I thought you were into rock, heavy metal--
- My mom was a fan of Tagore's songs.

00:56:51.344 --> 00:56:53.511
She is the one
who introduced me to the harmonium.

00:56:53.511 --> 00:56:56.344
Can't believe you used
to play the harmonium!

00:56:56.428 --> 00:56:57.344
Yeah.

00:56:57.344 --> 00:56:59.553
Then she started pushing me
to build a career...

00:56:59.594 --> 00:57:02.303
and the harmonium ended up
in the attic!

00:57:02.344 --> 00:57:06.178
You'll get more takers of Tagore's songs here
than your kind of music.

00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:11.178
I don't give a damn
about singing Tagore's songs!

00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:12.678
For me, a song is an attitude.

00:57:12.678 --> 00:57:13.636
It's a statement.

00:57:13.886 --> 00:57:14.636
Oh please!

00:57:14.636 --> 00:57:18.011
There's nothing cool about screaming
and head banging!

00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:21.969
Totally distorted pronunciation.
Can't even figure out if it's English or Bengali.

00:57:21.969 --> 00:57:24.303
And the lyrics are absurd...

00:57:24.303 --> 00:57:26.469
"Here comes war, Budhha's laughing"

00:57:26.553 --> 00:57:29.844
How can someone write a song
about a laughing Buddha?

00:57:30.594 --> 00:57:33.636
-You won't get it with your 'Mills and Boons' head.
-Hey, I don't read 'Mills and Boons'.

00:57:33.636 --> 00:57:35.553
It's an anti-nuclear song!

00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:37.969
Atom bombs.
Anti-nuclear.

00:57:38.636 --> 00:57:39.428
Clear?

00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:41.261
Atom bomb?

00:57:41.469 --> 00:57:44.344
Couldn't find any other subject?

00:57:44.386 --> 00:57:47.803
Every song should have a
socio-political perspective.

00:57:47.886 --> 00:57:51.594
Biplab says it's important in order
to understand culture and art.

00:57:51.594 --> 00:57:52.511
Think.

00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:53.469
Pratice thinking.

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.719
You're always talking
about this guy.

00:57:55.719 --> 00:57:58.469
How come I never see him?
Where's the dude?

00:57:58.469 --> 00:57:59.678
He's got a lot of work.

00:57:59.678 --> 00:58:03.136
Doesn't have time
for these petty bourgeoisie ghosts.

00:58:03.136 --> 00:58:05.386
He's roaming about
in deep, dark forests!

00:58:05.428 --> 00:58:07.219
- Like Tarzan?
- Like Gechhodada--

00:58:07.636 --> 00:58:08.803
Have you read
'Ha Ja Ba Ra La: A Nonsense Story'?

00:58:09.303 --> 00:58:10.594
He's like that elusive character
in it, Gechhodada.

00:58:10.719 --> 00:58:14.261
He's travelling all
over the country as we speak.

00:58:14.344 --> 00:58:15.594
And he likes your songs?

00:58:15.719 --> 00:58:17.928
Yes but he does not trade
in music.

00:58:18.303 --> 00:58:20.261
He trades in guns.

00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:24.428
Biplab says that "power flows
from the barrel of the gun".

00:58:25.428 --> 00:58:28.594
Whatever! Your lyrics are nonsensical.

00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:32.178
The correct phrase would be
'nonsense verse'.

00:58:32.219 --> 00:58:34.386
Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky" is considered
a work of genius...

00:58:34.469 --> 00:58:36.844
How come our lyrics are called gibberish?

00:58:37.636 --> 00:58:39.761
Listen to our songs carefully...

00:58:39.844 --> 00:58:42.219
Each one has an inner meaning.

00:58:52.678 --> 00:58:58.636
A tram is running here and there
Inside it sits a sad orangutan

00:59:03.553 --> 00:59:08.928
A tram is running here and there
Inside it sits a sad orangutan

00:59:09.094 --> 00:59:15.136
A scarf of deities around her neck
Angelina Jolie has come to Calcutta herself

00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:17.594
Gosh! The string tore!

00:59:18.219 --> 00:59:22.053
It's not the string's fault...
It couldn't take the sting of your lyrics!

00:59:22.136 --> 00:59:25.178
I didn't get any inner
or outer meaning of it.

00:59:25.178 --> 00:59:28.719
Why don't you write a nice, romantic song
instead of this gibberish?

00:59:28.719 --> 00:59:31.928
By the way, we don't 'write' songs...
Songs 'happen' to us.

00:59:31.928 --> 00:59:34.969
-Songs 'happen'--
-For me, the most romantic concept is revolution.

00:59:35.011 --> 00:59:37.553
I can't take the cheesy stars
and flowers bulls**t!

00:59:38.011 --> 00:59:40.136
Our love songs have to be sung
with the entire body.

00:59:40.136 --> 00:59:43.261
Our love song is passionate, uninhibited.
You know, it's like...

00:59:45.386 --> 00:59:49.636
Flowers, birds and the moon
Are things not so cool

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:54.594
Emotional overflow
Please keep it low

00:59:55.428 --> 00:59:58.053
Flowers, birds and the moon
Are things not so cool

00:59:58.053 --> 01:00:00.553
Emotional overflow
Please keep it low

01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:03.094
Silly words, silly tunes, silly songs

01:00:03.094 --> 01:00:08.094
Can't sing them sir
For public demand

01:00:10.594 --> 01:00:17.469
Even if you say it's for the public's sake
Or that the song will be a hit and awarded

01:00:20.761 --> 01:00:25.844
Even if you say it's for the public's sake
Or that the song will be a hit and awarded

01:00:25.844 --> 01:00:32.469
I will sing only passionate love songs
No silliness, no affection

01:00:33.428 --> 01:00:38.261
I don't have a thousand words to say
It doesn't work that way

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:40.969
I don't have a thousand words to say
It doesn't work that way

01:00:40.969 --> 01:00:43.511
I want you, it's not just lust

01:00:43.511 --> 01:00:46.011
Suddenly one day

01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:49.094
I myself am a ghost
and that's the problem

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:55.261
God!
This is your romantic song?

01:00:56.886 --> 01:01:02.261
Kadalibala is a better bet
for the stuff you're looking for.

01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:10.136
I won't give you my heart, won't give it
won't give it away

01:01:10.136 --> 01:01:15.303
I have already given my heart to you.

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:18.636
I used to watch all your films.

01:01:18.678 --> 01:01:22.386
It all started
with your first film...

01:01:22.386 --> 01:01:25.886
What they call love
at first night!

01:01:27.386 --> 01:01:28.844
For heaven's sake!

01:01:28.928 --> 01:01:30.553
All men are the same.

01:01:30.844 --> 01:01:35.261
- I think someone's become senile.
- My hair might be greying now...

01:01:35.261 --> 01:01:38.594
But I have been your fan
since I was a young man.

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:43.761
What great films you've acted in!

01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:48.469
You were called the "human goddess"!

01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:53.136
That's only on the big screen.
The film world is actually a filthy place.

01:01:53.136 --> 01:02:01.969
My guru used to say...
"Everything lasts as long as you are in shape".

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:05.886
Are looks like a cup of tea?
That everything ends when it's over?

01:02:05.969 --> 01:02:09.011
I think you are still beautiful.

01:02:09.219 --> 01:02:12.136
It's too late now.

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:14.386
Late?
Everyone's 'late' here.

01:02:14.428 --> 01:02:19.678
I am the late Bhooth Nath Bhadhuri.
You are the late Kadalibala Dasi.

01:02:19.761 --> 01:02:21.136
Can I say something?

01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:24.511
All men have the same thing to say,
"I love you"!

01:02:24.594 --> 01:02:26.303
I'm sick and tired
of hearing the same old thing.

01:02:26.303 --> 01:02:30.053
No, I was going to ask
if you have a photo.

01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:34.219
What!

01:02:34.219 --> 01:02:36.553
You sleazebag!

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:40.053
Saying such filthy things to me!
I'll teach you a lesson!

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:43.386
Hey, anyone around?

01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:47.928
Madam, you're getting excited unnecessarily.
When did I say filthy things to you?

01:02:48.053 --> 01:02:54.094
I was talking about a photo published
in the film magazines.

01:02:54.094 --> 01:02:58.428
Oh, a photo?
Say that!

01:02:58.594 --> 01:03:02.344
I would keep it
with me all the time!

01:03:02.344 --> 01:03:06.219
I worship you.
How can I say anything filthy to you?

01:03:06.219 --> 01:03:09.719
Kadaliya, my love.
Is Bhooth Nath bothering you again?

01:03:09.803 --> 01:03:11.053
I'll teach him a lesson today!

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.136
Get lost!

01:03:13.136 --> 01:03:15.386
A warrior without a sword!

01:03:15.719 --> 01:03:17.428
Mind your tongue, Bhooth Nath.

01:03:17.678 --> 01:03:20.303
This rose is for dear Kadaliya.

01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:23.136
Big talk with a plastic flower
in hand!

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:24.844
Stop annoying me.

01:03:24.928 --> 01:03:27.511
I have the fire of love
burning in my heart.

01:03:27.594 --> 01:03:32.011
Grant the true love of this lover.
Accept this humble flower.

01:03:32.136 --> 01:03:36.511
Dear Lord!
Such drama.

01:03:36.553 --> 01:03:41.094
Grant the true love of this lover.
Accept this humble flower.

01:03:41.178 --> 01:03:45.344
I'll feed you royal kebabs
with my own hands.

01:03:45.428 --> 01:03:48.428
You'll need a purgative after that!

01:03:48.594 --> 01:03:52.011
Tries to woo you everyday
with a rose!

01:03:52.011 --> 01:03:54.053
Don't give him too much attention, Kadali.

01:03:54.136 --> 01:03:56.303
You enemy of love, beware!

01:03:56.303 --> 01:03:58.094
Like I care!

01:03:58.178 --> 01:04:00.969
A soldier without a shield
or sword!

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:03.969
You're a wimp with a flower.
Bloody fool!

01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:09.844
I have a headache.
I need some Eau de Cologne!

01:04:11.511 --> 01:04:15.011
Quite a love triangle
you've got going there!

01:04:15.094 --> 01:04:18.011
Both your admirers fight all day.

01:04:18.011 --> 01:04:20.053
Why don't you tell me
which one you like?

01:04:20.053 --> 01:04:22.428
- I'm used to all this.
- Oh...

01:04:22.428 --> 01:04:28.261
When I worked my charm, everyone,
from the hero to the producer, would be at my feet!

01:04:28.344 --> 01:04:32.136
Now all the dead, old men are after me.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:37.053
But you have managed
to find a nice, young guy!

01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:40.844
So you want a young boyfriend?
My, my!

01:04:41.469 --> 01:04:44.344
It's fun to catch them
while they're still young.

01:04:44.511 --> 01:04:47.511
I'm not that old myself.

01:04:47.969 --> 01:04:49.053
Hmm... I understand.

01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:51.928
But you have to be hip
and happening for that.

01:04:52.344 --> 01:04:53.886
What are you saying?

01:04:54.219 --> 01:04:56.178
Hip means buttocks, right?

01:04:56.428 --> 01:04:57.011
Not that!

01:04:57.303 --> 01:04:59.344
This outfit of yours
is totally out-of-date.

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.761
You need to get rid
of these old clothes and the way you talk.

01:05:01.844 --> 01:05:04.886
Your jewellery just won't work today.

01:05:04.928 --> 01:05:10.219
Are you serious?
These are made of pure gold!

01:05:10.594 --> 01:05:12.178
Say goodbye to all that.

01:05:12.178 --> 01:05:14.844
You need a makeover.

01:05:15.636 --> 01:05:20.803
Makeover as in makeup?

01:05:21.469 --> 01:05:23.178
This thing is a little more permanent.

01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:25.594
Your look needs to blend
in with today's fashion.

01:05:25.844 --> 01:05:28.553
- Do I tie it up? Or a bob cut?
- No!

01:05:28.844 --> 01:05:31.011
You'll dress like me,
a pair of jeans to start with.

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:35.053
My God!
I thought they were men's pants.

01:05:35.428 --> 01:05:40.261
A grooming course is a must.
This retro thing will just not work.

01:05:40.428 --> 01:05:41.969
Retro thing?

01:05:42.053 --> 01:05:45.053
Are you talking
about flirting?

01:05:45.261 --> 01:05:49.219
It's the new-age flirting.
Get it, Kadalibala?

01:05:49.428 --> 01:05:53.094
You've got to speak English fluently...
Use slangs like "awesome", "mind-blowing"!

01:05:53.094 --> 01:05:56.969
You have to act like
you can't speak Bengali well.

01:05:57.178 --> 01:06:01.011
After every sentence you should
add a "cool" or "hot".

01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:05.428
Cool and hot as in...cold and hot?
Everyone knows that!

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.969
Now cool and hot mean
pretty much the same thing.

01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:13.719
My God!
I had only managed to learn basic English.

01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:16.844
Then I'd better get a hold
of Sir Ramsay.

01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:19.803
Koyel...
You are really a jewel!

01:06:20.761 --> 01:06:22.844
Bhooth Nath, don't you dare!

01:06:24.219 --> 01:06:26.428
Look, here comes the duo.
now they'll duel!

01:06:26.553 --> 01:06:28.928
Where are you headed, my love?

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:32.428
On my way to our foreigner friend
to learn English.

01:06:32.428 --> 01:06:37.303
Don't learn that wicked tongue!

01:06:37.428 --> 01:06:40.928
The English had first come to trade with us.
Eventually, they began to rule us.

01:06:41.053 --> 01:06:41.844
Traitors!

01:06:41.886 --> 01:06:44.303
Stop it.
You have no right to talk about loyalty.

01:06:44.303 --> 01:06:50.928
It's because of you Muslims that I had
to leave my native land and become a refugee.

01:06:50.928 --> 01:06:52.594
The partition took place
because of you.

01:06:52.594 --> 01:06:53.594
Listen, you guys.

01:06:53.844 --> 01:07:00.428
You claim to have had different kinds
of trees in your garden.

01:07:01.136 --> 01:07:06.344
Did you have a red-light area
in East Bengal?

01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:09.719
Yeah, we had them
in every house!

01:07:10.344 --> 01:07:13.553
Don't listen to him, my love.
He is an idiot.

01:07:13.636 --> 01:07:14.969
You a**, go off
to Pakistan!

01:07:15.053 --> 01:07:16.053
Stop it.

01:07:16.344 --> 01:07:17.553
I say, stop it.

01:07:18.053 --> 01:07:20.928
Don't ever say such things, Bhooth Nath.

01:07:21.344 --> 01:07:22.969
In the year 1999...

01:07:23.803 --> 01:07:24.803
At Kargil...

01:07:25.219 --> 01:07:33.969
Fighting alongside was my fellow,
Lieutenant Shahidul Islam.

01:07:34.053 --> 01:07:38.094
In fact, he died trying
to cover me.

01:07:38.094 --> 01:07:41.594
This country belongs
to all of us.

01:07:41.678 --> 01:07:45.469
Communal harmony!
I have written a song about it.

01:07:48.386 --> 01:07:50.344
Total cacophony, huh?

01:07:50.344 --> 01:07:54.094
This is how Chowdhury and Company were
spending the days of their afterlife.

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.719
Suddenly, there was trouble.

01:07:55.803 --> 01:07:58.178
Trouble?
In a haunted house?

01:07:58.886 --> 01:08:01.344
Generally, ghosts cause trouble
in human houses.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:05.011
It was exactly the opposite
in this case.

01:08:05.761 --> 01:08:07.636
People were causing trouble?

01:08:07.969 --> 01:08:09.928
By people you mean a party?

01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:13.178
Yes but not a political party.
A shooting party.

01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:30.094
(indistinct)

01:08:44.803 --> 01:08:49.219
Until now, they were only
after the new palace.

01:08:49.261 --> 01:08:50.928
Now they want to take
over the entire place!

01:08:51.053 --> 01:08:52.761
This is a raucous every day.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.428
We've tolerated this long enough...
Not anymore.

01:08:55.428 --> 01:08:56.636
We need a solution.

01:08:56.719 --> 01:08:58.636
Just look at what they've done
to the house!

01:08:58.803 --> 01:09:02.719
I was a film actress too, you know.
Never seen such a mess before!

01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:05.428
And the heroine is full
of hot air.

01:09:05.428 --> 01:09:07.386
Such poor dialogue delivery.

01:09:07.428 --> 01:09:10.803
I think I'll teach her
what acting really is!

01:09:10.844 --> 01:09:13.594
- How about scaring them off?
- Scaring them?

01:09:13.636 --> 01:09:16.969
It's not the British period anymore.
There's nothing called law and order.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:20.386
They don't give a damn.
They blew smoke right into my face!

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:23.136
That's because they were
in a big group.

01:09:23.136 --> 01:09:26.136
They are bound to get scared
if they are alone.

01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:30.636
Idea!
You should go scare the heroine.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:33.136
That's not a bad idea!

01:09:33.261 --> 01:09:38.511
Every actress is nervous right
before a shot.

01:09:38.678 --> 01:09:41.428
It's the best time
to scare them.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.469
Exactly.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:45.511
- In the year 1966--
- Oh, no!

01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:46.761
Okay, fine.

01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:50.969
Then let's begin the operation,
Heroine to heroine!

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:51.928
Yeah!

01:09:52.136 --> 01:09:53.344
12 by 1 by 1.

01:09:53.553 --> 01:09:54.553
Action.

01:10:09.011 --> 01:10:11.719
The actress collapsed.
The shoot was cancelled.

01:10:11.719 --> 01:10:13.803
Such stories spread quickly.

01:10:13.803 --> 01:10:16.761
It was all over the studios.

01:10:17.344 --> 01:10:19.469
The shooting parties stopped coming.

01:10:19.844 --> 01:10:22.511
So, the residents of Chowdhury Palace were
in a festive mood.

01:10:22.678 --> 01:10:24.053
Let's celebrate!

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.261
Cheers!

01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:32.136
When I was alive, this house saw celebrations
throughout the year, a festival for every season!

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:37.469
I was given the title of "Raibahadur"
because of the grandeur of my ceremonies.

01:10:37.594 --> 01:10:38.886
And he starts beating his own drum again!

01:10:38.928 --> 01:10:39.678
Excuse me?

01:10:39.886 --> 01:10:41.886
I meant there must have been drums playing
on such occasions...

01:10:41.886 --> 01:10:43.511
Hundreds of them!

01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:45.386
There used to be musicians
at the front door...

01:10:45.553 --> 01:10:49.428
Gin, rum and fountains of other drinks
for the foreigners.

01:10:49.428 --> 01:10:53.136
Seven-day feasts!
Dancers coming in from everywhere.

01:10:53.344 --> 01:10:57.636
And because of that,
they wrote a satire on me.

01:10:57.636 --> 01:10:59.553
Song?

01:10:59.553 --> 01:11:02.053
More of a satire.

01:11:02.053 --> 01:11:03.136
Anyway, forget it.

01:11:03.469 --> 01:11:06.636
How about celebrating?

01:11:06.636 --> 01:11:09.511
- Isn't it a little odd?
- What do you mean?

01:11:09.511 --> 01:11:12.594
Ghosts celebrating a religious festival?

01:11:12.594 --> 01:11:13.803
Atmaram?

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:16.303
Are you saying something to me?
I'm a poor man.

01:11:16.303 --> 01:11:17.886
Shut up, you idiot!

01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:23.636
Why can't ghosts have fun?
Tomorrow is the "festival of ghosts" anyway.

01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:25.928
Right!
Sir Ramsay, what do you think?

01:11:25.969 --> 01:11:28.636
I'm going to freak out!
Drink alcohol.

01:11:29.803 --> 01:11:31.969
This red-faced gentleman behaves
like he's alive!

01:11:32.053 --> 01:11:36.511
Yes!
You'll see live dancing too.

01:11:37.219 --> 01:11:40.428
Okay then,
since Sir agrees...

01:11:40.428 --> 01:11:43.261
Tomorrow night we'll celebrate
the "festival of ghosts".

01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:44.803
We'll decorate the house
with lights!

01:11:44.844 --> 01:11:47.178
Like Diwali?
Wow!

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:50.011
No one else's opinion counts, huh?
How democratic!

01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:51.761
What a hassle!

01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:53.094
It's not going to be
a religious ceremony anyway!

01:11:53.094 --> 01:11:56.344
Then it's okay.
Let's keep things secular.

01:11:56.636 --> 01:11:58.553
What do you say, Khan?

01:11:58.553 --> 01:12:00.594
I died in the battlefield.

01:12:00.678 --> 01:12:02.261
He says the same thing
over and over again.

01:12:02.261 --> 01:12:03.886
Okay.
It'll just be a cultural event.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.928
There'll be music too.
I'll be the DJ.

01:12:06.011 --> 01:12:07.636
Wonderful!

01:12:07.719 --> 01:12:10.178
Let's have our "Bhooth Chaturdashi"!

01:12:10.178 --> 01:12:13.219
What's that?

01:12:13.303 --> 01:12:16.136
The holy night of the ghosts.
Just like Halloween.

01:12:16.136 --> 01:12:18.386
Oh, let's have a costume party.

01:12:18.428 --> 01:12:20.553
What's that?

01:12:20.594 --> 01:12:26.511
I've heard of the Congress party, Muslim League...
I've even heard of the Communist Party.

01:12:26.511 --> 01:12:29.011
I've never heard
of a costume party though.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:32.761
It means to go as you like.
We'd do it in nursery school.

01:12:32.969 --> 01:12:35.428
Let's have it like a fashion show!

01:12:35.469 --> 01:12:37.678
Fashion show?

01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:39.469
Night show, matinee show...

01:12:39.469 --> 01:12:41.511
I've heard of these.
What's a fashion show?

01:12:41.511 --> 01:12:44.803
It's wearing all kinds of weird clothes
or not wearing any at all and walking on stage.

01:12:44.844 --> 01:12:46.594
Why should I walk unnecessarily?

01:12:46.594 --> 01:12:49.803
Bhooth Nath, models get paid
in thousands for it.

01:12:49.803 --> 01:12:50.678
Just think about it...

01:12:50.678 --> 01:12:56.386
How much people like Fa Hien, Megasthenes,
Huen Tsang would earn were they alive today.

01:12:56.386 --> 01:12:58.594
- In the year 1992...
- There he goes again!

01:12:58.594 --> 01:13:01.261
When I was posted
at Fort William...

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:05.469
we celebrated Independence Day
with a cultural event.

01:13:06.553 --> 01:13:07.761
I was the organiser.

01:13:07.761 --> 01:13:10.469
Cut it out!
Let's stick to the occasion.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:16.386
What exactly can a military man do now
apart from bossing around?

01:13:16.386 --> 01:13:17.553
Me?

01:13:17.553 --> 01:13:18.886
I'll burst fire crackers.

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:23.678
The same hands that have released
rocket launchers will release fireworks.

01:13:23.678 --> 01:13:25.094
Here goes!

01:13:27.761 --> 01:13:29.053
Startled him!

01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:50.636
We are the ghosts of Chowdhury Palace
We are notorious, we are weird

01:13:50.636 --> 01:13:55.636
We are the ghosts of Chowdhury Palace

01:13:55.636 --> 01:14:01.469
We ghosts have organised
This amazing event

01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:07.469
We ghosts have organised
This happening festival

01:14:07.469 --> 01:14:11.303
Ghosts dancing about

01:14:11.303 --> 01:14:17.094
We are notorious
We are weird

01:14:17.178 --> 01:14:21.761
We are the ghosts of Chowdhury Palace

01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:29.636
You won't get a haunted house like this

01:14:29.678 --> 01:14:35.261
The king of all haunted houses

01:14:38.928 --> 01:14:52.761
A ghoul or a demon?
Or the ghost of a Muslim?

01:14:53.219 --> 01:15:01.969
What kind of a ghost are you?
What type of a ghost?

01:15:02.553 --> 01:15:08.761
I died in an accident
Then became a ghost

01:15:08.886 --> 01:15:15.844
All ye spirits, lift thee spirits
And let's raise a toast

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:24.803
O precious life
You left me, precious life

01:15:24.803 --> 01:15:30.636
Thank God I'm dead
Now I don't have to care about you

01:15:31.053 --> 01:15:37.136
O precious life
You left me, precious life

01:15:37.886 --> 01:15:43.386
Thank God I'm dead
Now I don't have to care about you

01:15:43.386 --> 01:15:51.636
All you ghosts put your hands together
Today we'll sing a "Qawwali"

01:15:51.678 --> 01:15:55.761
Today we'll drink whiskey and rum
Today we are in high spirits

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:58.969
Is he killing mosquitoes?

01:15:58.969 --> 01:16:03.469
What an idiot.
Clapping at his own song!

01:16:04.261 --> 01:16:08.344
All you ghosts put your hands together
Today we'll sing a "Qawwali"

01:16:08.344 --> 01:16:16.719
We'll have a blast
All of you keep watching

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:26.594
We'll have a blast
All of you keep watching

01:16:27.969 --> 01:16:33.803
My hometown is Darbhanga

01:16:34.636 --> 01:16:37.886
My hometown is Darbhanga

01:16:37.886 --> 01:16:41.594
I feel more alive after dying

01:16:41.594 --> 01:16:45.344
Better not mess with me
Or else, there will be trouble

01:16:45.344 --> 01:16:49.053
My hometown is Darbhanga
I feel more alive after dying

01:16:49.053 --> 01:16:52.678
Everything's on the move

01:16:52.678 --> 01:17:02.386
When all of us start dancing together
We get the whole world moving

01:17:05.344 --> 01:17:12.303
Touchables and untouchables

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:17.594
There's no difference

01:17:17.594 --> 01:17:21.969
We are just ghosts

01:17:21.969 --> 01:17:27.136
The ghosts of Chowdhury Palace
Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts

01:17:29.386 --> 01:17:34.178
The ghosts of Chowdhury Palace

01:18:04.219 --> 01:18:05.636
That guy is ambidextrous!

01:18:05.636 --> 01:18:08.136
- What?
- Ambidextrous.

01:18:08.136 --> 01:18:13.136
We are the ghosts of Chowdhury Palace

01:18:13.594 --> 01:18:15.428
The event was a grand success.

01:18:15.761 --> 01:18:17.553
Sir Ramsay was overjoyed.

01:18:17.844 --> 01:18:19.886
So much so that he wanted
to entitle everybody "Raibahadur".

01:18:20.428 --> 01:18:23.053
But Darpa Narayan didn't
like the idea much.

01:18:23.053 --> 01:18:28.719
He settled for a picnic the following Sunday
to keep the festive spirit alive.

01:18:29.094 --> 01:18:32.344
So far so good.
But there's something odd...

01:18:32.344 --> 01:18:34.719
Highly suspicious!

01:18:34.803 --> 01:18:38.303
How come Biplab isn't present
in any of these events?

01:18:38.803 --> 01:18:41.053
Patience, my friend.

01:18:41.719 --> 01:18:47.219
Ages may pass before "biplab",
meaning revolution comes!

01:18:48.094 --> 01:18:49.928
Anyway...
What was I saying?

01:18:49.928 --> 01:18:53.344
Yes, the picnic.
A picnic for ghosts!

01:19:04.178 --> 01:19:09.636
(radio playing)

01:19:10.219 --> 01:19:13.303
Here you go, ma'am.

01:19:17.428 --> 01:19:22.011
- Sir?
- Hmm? Thank you. Cheers!

01:19:22.928 --> 01:19:25.344
- Sir.
- Hmm.

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:27.511
-Sir?
-Hmm.

01:19:27.636 --> 01:19:29.719
That's my point.

01:19:31.011 --> 01:19:32.178
You're cheating!

01:19:32.178 --> 01:19:33.761
-Cheers!
-It's not cheating at all!

01:19:33.761 --> 01:19:36.053
Hey! Come here.

01:19:42.219 --> 01:19:43.178
- Watch out!
- Sorry!

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:45.469
Let's end the game here,
at love all.

01:19:45.469 --> 01:19:47.386
Please...
Don't even mention the word love.

01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:49.678
You're the most unromantic
person I've met.

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:53.219
(singing)

01:19:55.928 --> 01:19:59.428
Who's disturbing me
in the middle of a picnic?

01:20:02.761 --> 01:20:04.178
My God!

01:20:04.178 --> 01:20:07.886
Girls always want things to be lovey-dovey.
God, it's a disease!

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:10.719
Why do you hate girls so much?

01:20:11.303 --> 01:20:13.053
Did anyone dump you?

01:20:13.344 --> 01:20:15.178
Quite a few!

01:20:16.594 --> 01:20:18.261
All girls are not the same.

01:20:19.053 --> 01:20:20.344
I can see that.

01:20:20.844 --> 01:20:26.886
You killed yourself for a guy
instead of looking for him, you're hitting on me!

01:20:30.511 --> 01:20:32.261
What a hassle!

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:33.844
What's wrong?

01:20:34.678 --> 01:20:35.761
What's wrong?

01:20:36.219 --> 01:20:42.136
I found out that Sam got 10 lakhs
from Dad and took off to Australia.

01:20:42.261 --> 01:20:47.136
And guess what?
He's found himself a rich, foreign chick there!

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:49.344
I'm sorry.

01:20:51.219 --> 01:20:55.261
This food is amazing!
Must be the cooking oil.

01:20:56.511 --> 01:20:59.636
Tell me something...

01:20:59.719 --> 01:21:02.428
Why did you quit cooking?
To become a soldier?

01:21:02.428 --> 01:21:03.761
Get lost!

01:21:03.761 --> 01:21:04.553
Sorry.

01:21:04.594 --> 01:21:10.219
I know I've made fun of you.
But one has to admit...

01:21:11.178 --> 01:21:12.803
You "faak,"
or cook, very well.

01:21:12.803 --> 01:21:15.761
Mind your language, Bhooth Nath!

01:21:16.094 --> 01:21:16.761
Why?

01:21:16.969 --> 01:21:21.969
I was just saying
that he is a brilliant cook.

01:21:22.803 --> 01:21:26.094
Bhaduri, you are quite a foodie.

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:30.803
I'm from East Bengal.
You bet I'm a foodie!

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:37.261
If only you had tasted steamed Hilsa fish
from my hometown...

01:21:37.678 --> 01:21:39.261
Hilsa is tasty...

01:21:40.303 --> 01:21:42.428
But it pales in comparison
to prawns.

01:21:42.761 --> 01:21:44.969
- Prawns?
- Definitely.

01:21:45.178 --> 01:21:48.261
Nothing's tastier than prawns cooked
in a delicate coconut cream sauce!

01:21:48.261 --> 01:21:50.928
You're being childish about this.

01:21:52.136 --> 01:21:55.553
Nothing compares to Hilsa fish
from the Padma river.

01:21:55.719 --> 01:21:57.261
What do you know of prawns?

01:21:57.261 --> 01:22:00.511
I understand it better than you!
Prawns are water insects.

01:22:00.553 --> 01:22:02.178
Prawns are insects?

01:22:02.219 --> 01:22:03.469
You are a complete idiot.

01:22:03.803 --> 01:22:05.261
Bloody Bengali from the East!

01:22:05.844 --> 01:22:07.844
Damn you Westerners!

01:22:07.928 --> 01:22:11.636
You guys put more sugar
than salt in your food!

01:22:11.678 --> 01:22:13.386
And you brag
about water insects!

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.928
- Hey! Get lost.
- Huh?

01:22:14.928 --> 01:22:15.844
Get out!

01:22:16.136 --> 01:22:17.094
Get the hell out now!

01:22:17.094 --> 01:22:18.344
I definitely will.

01:22:18.386 --> 01:22:21.844
I've no intention of staying in a place
where my Hilsa fish is insulted.

01:22:21.844 --> 01:22:23.053
Just go.

01:22:23.053 --> 01:22:25.594
Do we really need a regional strife?
East Bengal versus West Bengal?

01:22:25.594 --> 01:22:27.928
Chowdhury Palace is
in big trouble!

01:22:27.928 --> 01:22:28.803
- What's wrong?
- What are you saying?

01:22:28.803 --> 01:22:29.803
Exactly what you're hearing.

01:22:29.886 --> 01:22:33.636
We were able to live there peacefully
because it was disputed.

01:22:33.636 --> 01:22:36.636
Now the legal issues have been resolved
in an out-of-court settlement.

01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:39.844
All the owners are jointly giving it
away to a promoter.

01:22:39.844 --> 01:22:41.261
- What?
- Yes!

01:22:41.261 --> 01:22:43.928
The house will be demolished
to build a mall.

01:22:43.928 --> 01:22:45.969
- What?
- No, it's a different kind of a mall.

01:22:45.969 --> 01:22:47.386
This is a shopping mall.

01:22:47.386 --> 01:22:51.136
Everyone used to taunt me,
calling me a "girl for sale".

01:22:51.136 --> 01:22:52.928
Now it's actually going
to come true!

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:58.386
They'll get rid of us along with the house.
I'll become a refugee again!

01:22:58.386 --> 01:23:00.803
Kick me out
of my own house!

01:23:00.928 --> 01:23:04.511
Had this been the British period,
I would have hanged this guy to death.

01:23:04.636 --> 01:23:06.553
Who's taking over the place?

01:23:06.553 --> 01:23:08.219
A man called Bhutoria,
meaning ghost-chaser.

01:23:08.219 --> 01:23:10.303
No wonder he's trying
to chase us ghosts away!

01:23:10.344 --> 01:23:11.761
But how did you find out?

01:23:11.761 --> 01:23:14.969
Since the responsibility of the security
of Chowdhury Palace was on me...

01:23:14.969 --> 01:23:18.469
I had set up a surveillance camera.

01:23:18.469 --> 01:23:22.261
I received an MMS alert
some time back.

01:23:22.844 --> 01:23:27.136
Bhutoria and company have gathered
in front of the main gate.

01:23:27.844 --> 01:23:29.553
My God!

01:23:29.553 --> 01:23:31.719
We should get back right now.

01:23:31.886 --> 01:23:34.053
Comrades, let's go.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:36.678
Come.

01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:37.511
There! There!

01:23:37.719 --> 01:23:39.136
- Where is the guy?
- Over there.

01:23:39.136 --> 01:23:40.553
He is the bloody promoter.

01:23:40.678 --> 01:23:43.053
He's come prepared
with a lawyer.

01:23:43.136 --> 01:23:45.053
Who is that tiny guy?

01:23:45.094 --> 01:23:46.303
His sidekick.

01:23:46.344 --> 01:23:48.219
We should beat the hell out of them!

01:23:50.803 --> 01:23:53.219
Here you go Bhutoria...
Now it's all yours.

01:23:53.303 --> 01:23:54.344
At last.

01:23:54.511 --> 01:24:01.469
Ganesh Bhutoria always makes sure
that he gets whatever he wants.

01:24:02.636 --> 01:24:06.094
I'll turn this place around!

01:24:06.261 --> 01:24:09.053
There's original Burma Teak here.
You'll get a good price for it.

01:24:09.594 --> 01:24:11.344
That apart, there's...

01:24:11.344 --> 01:24:12.553
What about the brick inside?
Will I get a price for that too?

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:16.011
No, sir.
The flooring inside is made of Italian marble.

01:24:16.011 --> 01:24:18.136
- Oh.
- Extra profit!

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:22.136
I'll put it to good use.

01:24:22.636 --> 01:24:24.803
It'll be a superhit!
Go get a coconut.

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:27.219
Why the hell are you stammering?

01:24:27.219 --> 01:24:30.928
Which coconut, sir?
The one with water or--

01:24:30.928 --> 01:24:32.844
Stop stammering, you fool.

01:24:32.928 --> 01:24:34.344
Doesn't know anything!

01:24:34.594 --> 01:24:38.553
Before any auspicious event, you need
to crack open a coconut.

01:24:38.803 --> 01:24:39.678
That kind of a coconut.

01:24:40.053 --> 01:24:41.719
Do you want me
to crack open your head instead?

01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:44.219
- Sorry, sir.
- Go.

01:24:44.219 --> 01:24:46.053
I'll get it right away!

01:24:46.303 --> 01:24:50.428
Possession is the most important thing.
It's the nine points of law.

01:24:50.928 --> 01:24:52.761
You know...

01:24:52.803 --> 01:24:55.678
I'll make a beautiful shopping mall
on this plot.

01:24:56.094 --> 01:24:58.511
Parking lot in the basement.

01:24:58.636 --> 01:25:00.469
Groceries on the ground floor.

01:25:01.178 --> 01:25:05.553
Level one will have clothing
and lingerie.

01:25:06.803 --> 01:25:10.178
Level two will have jewellery
and fashion accessories.

01:25:10.344 --> 01:25:11.844
Level three will have the food court.

01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:14.178
And level four will be star studded!

01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:19.511
Multiplexes, premiere shows, film stars...
It'll be a five-storey, five-star mall.

01:25:19.594 --> 01:25:22.636
I've even thought of a name...
Five Star Plaza!

01:25:23.428 --> 01:25:26.053
I'll talk to my numerologist
and finalise everything.

01:25:26.053 --> 01:25:31.136
Sir, there's a five-star hotel called
"Sonar Bangla" or The Golden House.

01:25:31.219 --> 01:25:34.719
You should name this "Bhooth Bangla",
or The Haunted House, after yourself!

01:25:35.136 --> 01:25:36.136
Shut up!

01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:37.011
Hail Lord Ganesha!

01:25:37.386 --> 01:25:40.594
The fate of Chowdhury Palace is
in deep despair!

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:44.011
I'm ready to sacrifice my life again.

01:25:44.094 --> 01:25:46.678
You can't give up your life twice!

01:25:46.678 --> 01:25:49.928
Once it's out of the tube,
you can't squeeze it back in.

01:25:50.969 --> 01:25:53.761
I've asked the architect
to begin work immediately.

01:25:53.761 --> 01:25:56.511
This needs to be transformed
into the best mall in town.

01:25:56.553 --> 01:26:00.636
There'll be a fountain here,
a fibre glass roof on top...

01:26:00.761 --> 01:26:05.094
Bubble lifts, escalator,
central air conditioning...

01:26:05.094 --> 01:26:08.178
It'll be a mini Singapore
in Calcutta!

01:26:08.386 --> 01:26:14.636
You're going to build Singapore here...
Will the municipality just sit and watch?

01:26:14.886 --> 01:26:17.053
Are you from the municipal corporation?

01:26:19.428 --> 01:26:22.303
- We run the entire municipality!
- Oh...

01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:25.969
This is our responsibility
towards society.

01:26:26.219 --> 01:26:28.678
So what do I have to do?

01:26:28.803 --> 01:26:29.886
Pay up.

01:26:30.136 --> 01:26:33.303
Can't let you enjoy it all
by yourself now, can we?

01:26:33.553 --> 01:26:35.094
The revolutionary poet
Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote...

01:26:35.094 --> 01:26:38.178
"Give and take at the same time,
don't walk away from it".

01:26:38.261 --> 01:26:40.678
You'll "give", we'll "take"...

01:26:40.928 --> 01:26:43.178
We'll be in it together.
Or else, I won't go away.

01:26:43.178 --> 01:26:44.553
How much do I have to pay?

01:26:44.594 --> 01:26:46.553
One...hard cash.

01:26:47.428 --> 01:26:49.219
Can't we negotiate?

01:26:49.219 --> 01:26:50.261
Sik-Sik--

01:26:50.261 --> 01:26:51.303
What the hell do you mean, sick?

01:26:51.344 --> 01:26:53.178
Sixty-five thousand?

01:26:54.011 --> 01:26:54.803
What's your name?

01:26:55.219 --> 01:26:58.136
My name...
Gu-Gu-Gu...

01:26:58.386 --> 01:26:59.386
Gu... What?

01:26:59.969 --> 01:27:02.553
My name is T. K. Guchait.

01:27:02.928 --> 01:27:05.594
Do you think I'm a beggar?

01:27:05.636 --> 01:27:07.344
Do you know who I am?

01:27:07.344 --> 01:27:10.803
With a single phone call,
I can start a curfew in town!

01:27:10.844 --> 01:27:13.553
Always remember, I am Pod Podhan.

01:27:13.553 --> 01:27:15.344
Your name is Pod?

01:27:15.344 --> 01:27:18.053
Hey!
Not Pod... It's Promod.

01:27:18.219 --> 01:27:20.344
Oh, Parmod.

01:27:20.886 --> 01:27:22.844
Nice name.

01:27:23.719 --> 01:27:25.261
Don't mess with him.

01:27:25.636 --> 01:27:29.928
I might have a minor speech problem
but I'm quite cultured otherwise.

01:27:29.969 --> 01:27:32.803
In fact, I'd written a poem
in high school.

01:27:32.803 --> 01:27:35.386
"There's tremendous rain,
That's why be patient

01:27:35.386 --> 01:27:38.303
East Bengal has Poshanto,
Mohan Bagan has Poshun"

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:41.594
- These days, he writes highbred poetry.
- Don't think he is an idiot.

01:27:41.636 --> 01:27:42.094
Not at all...

01:27:42.094 --> 01:27:44.261
He's got the attitude
of a rebel, too.

01:27:44.261 --> 01:27:45.178
His demand must be kept.

01:27:45.178 --> 01:27:47.636
You people cannot
threaten my client like this.

01:27:47.636 --> 01:27:49.094
Shut up!

01:27:49.553 --> 01:27:51.844
You're trying to show off
in that stupid black coat of yours, huh?

01:27:52.261 --> 01:27:55.928
I hang out with your boss from the High Court.
We drink together.

01:27:55.969 --> 01:27:58.594
He's going to receive the ticket
in the next elections, right?

01:27:59.011 --> 01:28:04.303
Hey! I'm being very clear.
One crore, hard cash.

01:28:04.511 --> 01:28:07.594
Otherwise, get lost.

01:28:07.886 --> 01:28:12.053
Please consider my plea, sir.
One crore is a little too much.

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.594
It's not just for myself.

01:28:14.678 --> 01:28:17.178
Different political parties...
The ruling party, the opposition...

01:28:17.178 --> 01:28:18.928
All them them
have a share in it.

01:28:19.053 --> 01:28:20.428
As Tagore wrote...

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:23.761
"We are there for other's sake
and they are there for ours".

01:28:24.011 --> 01:28:25.511
In other words...

01:28:25.511 --> 01:28:29.803
United we stand,
divided we misunderstand!

01:28:30.303 --> 01:28:33.303
But so much money...
All at one go!

01:28:33.303 --> 01:28:34.594
Take your time.

01:28:34.636 --> 01:28:37.553
I'm giving you seven days.
Get the cash together.

01:28:37.969 --> 01:28:43.178
You can forget about this project
if you don't pay up by then.

01:28:43.303 --> 01:28:47.011
Remember my name.
"Pod Podhan".

01:28:47.469 --> 01:28:48.261
Let's go.

01:28:48.428 --> 01:28:51.386
You better remember his words!

01:28:51.678 --> 01:28:54.011
There's a twist
in the tale.

01:28:54.094 --> 01:28:56.636
Nothing of the sort.
That bloody promoter is filthy rich.

01:28:56.636 --> 01:28:58.344
To him, one crore is dirt!

01:28:58.428 --> 01:29:03.553
He might be rich.
But he'll negotiate till his last breath.

01:29:03.636 --> 01:29:04.969
After all, he's a businessman.

01:29:04.969 --> 01:29:08.178
So, we have some time
and a window of opportunity.

01:29:08.178 --> 01:29:11.386
We can't just sit idle.

01:29:11.844 --> 01:29:14.344
Biplab would have figured
out a guerilla warfare plan.

01:29:14.344 --> 01:29:16.303
Where is he?

01:29:16.303 --> 01:29:18.969
He has a lot of sympathy
for poor people like us.

01:29:19.094 --> 01:29:20.386
He's in South India...

01:29:20.386 --> 01:29:24.303
working with revolutionaries
on improvised explosives.

01:29:24.344 --> 01:29:25.969
But I can fill in for him!

01:29:26.011 --> 01:29:27.011
Listen, son.

01:29:27.094 --> 01:29:31.344
It's very easy to wear a Che Guevara shirt
and talk about a proxy war.

01:29:31.428 --> 01:29:33.719
- You know, in the year--
- Excuse me.

01:29:33.761 --> 01:29:35.011
First of all, this shirt is mine.

01:29:35.094 --> 01:29:39.636
Second, you're mispronouncing the name
of the guy printed on it.

01:29:39.636 --> 01:29:42.636
- And third--
- Friends, let's not fight amonsgt ourselves.

01:29:42.636 --> 01:29:44.469
Now we need a master plan.

01:29:44.511 --> 01:29:47.761
- Let's listen to the army man.
- Thank you, sir.

01:29:47.886 --> 01:29:51.469
In the year 1971,
during the Bangladesh War...

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:52.719
General Yahia...

01:29:52.719 --> 01:29:55.678
Oh, no, not again!
No more nostalgia.

01:29:55.678 --> 01:29:57.969
Okay, okay.

01:29:58.053 --> 01:30:02.136
In any combat,
the first stage is intelligence gathering.

01:30:02.344 --> 01:30:03.928
Covert survey.

01:30:03.969 --> 01:30:07.761
We have to find out the strengths
and weaknesses of the opponent.

01:30:07.803 --> 01:30:10.636
Then, half the battle is won.

01:30:10.761 --> 01:30:12.844
Oh God, who's going to do that?

01:30:12.844 --> 01:30:16.844
We can't use Khaja for that.

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:17.553
You fool!

01:30:17.553 --> 01:30:19.219
What?

01:30:19.219 --> 01:30:24.344
I have acted in a few local plays...
with social or historical themes...

01:30:24.511 --> 01:30:27.094
"Really, Seleucus,
what a diverse country!"

01:30:27.178 --> 01:30:28.386
Lucida Grande

01:30:28.386 --> 01:30:29.636
Wait.

01:30:30.094 --> 01:30:32.469
I don't think anybody can act better
than me here.

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:35.636
All of your talents will be put
to use in good time.

01:30:36.094 --> 01:30:44.594
But at the moment, we need the cooperation
of Lt. Pablo Patranobis and Capt. Koyel Dhar.

01:30:45.219 --> 01:30:47.469
Don't mind my words, young man.

01:30:47.553 --> 01:30:51.136
In times of war, the commander needs
to be harsh when required.

01:30:51.261 --> 01:30:53.136
Okay, Commander.

01:30:53.261 --> 01:30:54.511
What can we do for you?

01:30:54.886 --> 01:30:56.469
Not much...

01:30:56.636 --> 01:30:59.678
You gus are
about to get married.

01:30:59.886 --> 01:31:00.928
- What!
- Huh?

01:31:01.011 --> 01:31:04.678
What you do in reality
is entirely your business.

01:31:04.719 --> 01:31:07.094
You'll go to Bhutoria's office...

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:11.386
as a soon-to-be-married couple.

01:31:11.386 --> 01:31:16.011
You'll pretend to be looking
for an apartment.

01:31:16.178 --> 01:31:22.844
Your mission is to extract vital information
from Bhutoria's sidekick about his boss.

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:25.844
Bhutoria treats Guchait really badly.

01:31:25.928 --> 01:31:28.969
That's why, deep inside,
he has a raging anger for his boss.

01:31:28.969 --> 01:31:34.053
Besides, he wears all kinds of rings,
which means he's insecure.

01:31:34.053 --> 01:31:37.511
These weaknesses need
to be exploited to get information.

01:31:38.053 --> 01:31:39.511
We're looking for a nice apartment...

01:31:39.511 --> 01:31:41.428
- Around 800 square feet.
- Yeah.

01:31:41.428 --> 01:31:42.678
In South Calcutta.

01:31:42.761 --> 01:31:44.803
South-facing, with two bedrooms.

01:31:44.928 --> 01:31:49.636
We just saw an advertisement...
Golden Greens.

01:31:49.678 --> 01:31:54.386
If you book now,
you'll get a special rebate.

01:31:54.386 --> 01:31:57.803
Check this out.
Lots of greenery...

01:31:57.803 --> 01:31:59.928
Amazing scenic beauty!

01:32:00.219 --> 01:32:03.344
You can also see this water body
from the balcony.

01:32:03.344 --> 01:32:10.886
Both sides are south-facing.
We also arrange for bank loans.

01:32:11.219 --> 01:32:13.178
Can we see the site sometime?

01:32:13.178 --> 01:32:18.386
Any day.
How about today?

01:32:18.761 --> 01:32:20.803
No, not today.

01:32:21.928 --> 01:32:23.094
It won't take very long.

01:32:23.094 --> 01:32:29.928
We'll also arrange
for a vehicle.

01:32:30.261 --> 01:32:32.678
No, today won't work.

01:32:32.678 --> 01:32:36.594
Today we have
to visit Saint Bhooth Nath.

01:32:36.594 --> 01:32:40.594
He's not available very often, you know.

01:32:40.594 --> 01:32:43.553
Thank God he's here right now.

01:32:43.553 --> 01:32:46.678
He's in Calcutta just
for three days.

01:32:46.678 --> 01:32:52.094
Who is Saint Bhooth Nath?
A famous astrologer?

01:32:52.094 --> 01:32:54.219
- Are you serious?
- Not just an astrologer...

01:32:54.261 --> 01:32:58.344
He has the past, present
and the future at his fingertips!

01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:01.469
Barrack Obama had called for him.
He refused to go.

01:33:01.761 --> 01:33:06.136
He has no interest
in such worldly matters.

01:33:06.136 --> 01:33:07.136
Sir...

01:33:07.136 --> 01:33:13.469
Will you please introuce me
to Saint Bhooth Nath?

01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:16.261
I'm going through
a really bad time.

01:33:16.261 --> 01:33:18.636
There's peace neither at home
nor at office.

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:25.303
I've tried all the amulets available
for good luck.

01:33:25.303 --> 01:33:27.344
But nothing worked.

01:33:27.344 --> 01:33:31.928
Please see what you can do.

01:33:31.928 --> 01:33:36.678
But the saint does not
meet people easily.

01:33:36.678 --> 01:33:41.928
Ma'am, please do something.
My life has become unbearable.

01:33:41.928 --> 01:33:44.844
I'll end up committing suicide.

01:33:44.844 --> 01:33:46.178
Our group will get stronger!

01:33:46.178 --> 01:33:46.886
Sorry?

01:33:46.886 --> 01:33:50.969
I was just saying
that he can't say no to Koyel.

01:33:50.969 --> 01:33:54.803
Ma'am, please help me.

01:33:54.803 --> 01:33:58.636
I'll get you the apartment
at a minium rate.

01:33:59.386 --> 01:34:03.886
Since you're insisting...

01:34:03.886 --> 01:34:09.178
But if you bring up money,
he will get very angry.

01:34:10.136 --> 01:34:10.928
Praise the Lord!

01:34:10.928 --> 01:34:18.636
(chanting)

01:34:18.636 --> 01:34:22.053
I had spoken to you
about him.

01:34:22.053 --> 01:34:25.011
He's in great distress.
Please help him.

01:34:25.011 --> 01:34:28.178
Full moon, half moon, solutions and problems!
(speaks gibberish)

01:34:28.178 --> 01:34:31.344
Sir, have mercy on me.

01:34:31.344 --> 01:34:32.844
Women and wealth, digestives or not...
(continues gbberish)

01:34:32.844 --> 01:34:35.219
Your life and death
are now in my hands.

01:34:35.219 --> 01:34:36.969
Let me hear
about your troubles.

01:34:36.969 --> 01:34:39.553
- My trouble is my boss.
- Boss?

01:34:39.553 --> 01:34:45.928
He is always humiliating me.

01:34:45.928 --> 01:34:49.053
We have fix him, right?

01:34:49.053 --> 01:34:54.428
He's really wicked.

01:34:54.428 --> 01:34:56.636
He needs to be taught a lesson.

01:34:56.636 --> 01:34:59.886
Is that so?
Let's hear about his deeds.

01:34:59.928 --> 01:35:01.969
He has committed horrible crimes.

01:35:01.969 --> 01:35:07.053
He even burnt his wife
to death!

01:35:07.678 --> 01:35:11.928
She lived up
to her name, Laxmi.

01:35:11.928 --> 01:35:14.678
Really?

01:35:14.886 --> 01:35:19.636
After getting information
about Bhutoria's past...

01:35:19.636 --> 01:35:21.678
The master plan was drawn up.

01:35:21.678 --> 01:35:26.136
Unfortunately, people aren't scared
of ghosts like they used to be.

01:35:26.136 --> 01:35:28.969
They would have to catch
people alone at night.

01:35:28.969 --> 01:35:30.969
They would have to catch
people alone at night.

01:35:31.136 --> 01:35:32.178
They were all very charged up!

01:35:32.386 --> 01:35:35.303
The most vital thing now
is finding contacts.

01:35:35.303 --> 01:35:38.886
There's a social networking site
for ghosts, Spookbook!

01:35:38.886 --> 01:35:41.761
- We can get contacts from there.
- Spookbook!

01:35:42.886 --> 01:35:44.136
There's really a website
like that?

01:35:44.136 --> 01:35:46.886
- Yes.
- Its slogan is "the real friend of a ghost".

01:35:46.886 --> 01:35:47.844
Good.

01:35:47.844 --> 01:35:50.011
Let's see
if we can find a volunteer.

01:35:50.261 --> 01:35:52.678
They found exactly
what they were looking for.

01:35:52.678 --> 01:35:54.136
One-armed Kartik...

01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:55.719
a terror in his locality.

01:35:55.719 --> 01:36:01.761
He was a thug
for political parties.

01:36:01.761 --> 01:36:05.511
He lost his arm
while making a crude bomb.

01:36:05.553 --> 01:36:07.553
But that didn't curb his spirit.

01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:12.761
He recently got bumped off
by a member of a rival group.

01:36:17.636 --> 01:36:21.303
I'll have to put this here.
It's hurting me in the wrong place.

01:36:21.428 --> 01:36:22.678
Whom do I have to
get ride of?

01:36:22.678 --> 01:36:24.844
Fifty percent before the job
and fifty after the job.

01:36:24.844 --> 01:36:26.636
Kartik dear...

01:36:26.636 --> 01:36:28.886
We have risen
above violence.

01:36:28.886 --> 01:36:31.969
We are in great trouble.
Help us out.

01:36:31.969 --> 01:36:35.178
Want to throw out the tenants?
No problem. I have my ways.

01:36:35.428 --> 01:36:38.761
No, we haven't called you
to torture anyone.

01:36:38.761 --> 01:36:41.469
We have called you
to save us from torture.

01:36:41.469 --> 01:36:45.678
You'll be rewarded for this.

01:36:45.678 --> 01:36:46.928
Who's this cartoon?

01:36:46.928 --> 01:36:49.428
Is he from a theatre group
or something?

01:36:49.428 --> 01:36:53.136
Kartik, please...
We are in great trouble.

01:36:53.344 --> 01:36:54.719
Okay, fine.

01:36:54.719 --> 01:36:56.053
I can't turn down
a girl's request.

01:36:56.303 --> 01:36:59.136
You will be blessed.
Khaja Khan is right.

01:36:59.136 --> 01:37:01.261
So many helpless ghosts...
Where do we take shelter?

01:37:01.511 --> 01:37:02.969
Blessed?

01:37:03.053 --> 01:37:06.344
I'm almost drowning in sin.

01:37:06.428 --> 01:37:08.428
The world is full
of traitors.

01:37:09.011 --> 01:37:12.136
I taught that kid
how to use a knife.

01:37:12.428 --> 01:37:15.594
I had no clue
when he turned on me.

01:37:15.594 --> 01:37:18.511
So I went when he called for me
but he slit his own mentor's throat!

01:37:18.844 --> 01:37:21.719
I'll honour you
with the Queen's Cross.

01:37:21.761 --> 01:37:24.178
Who the hell are you?
Really, you are a weird bunch!

01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:27.136
You just have to help us.

01:37:27.136 --> 01:37:30.719
Okay, fine.
Like I said, I can't turn a lady down.

01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:34.344
I always used to get my girl
whatever she wanted.

01:37:34.344 --> 01:37:40.928
Everything, down to those
tight, low-waist jeans!

01:37:40.928 --> 01:37:43.553
There's just one problem.
Everyone knows that you are dead.

01:37:43.553 --> 01:37:44.761
Not at all!

01:37:44.969 --> 01:37:48.011
Those jerks had hidden my body
in a septic tank.

01:37:48.011 --> 01:37:50.053
Nobody knows
that I am dead.

01:37:50.053 --> 01:37:52.594
Everybody thinks
that I've gone underground!

01:37:52.594 --> 01:37:54.594
Good, you won't be suspected.

01:37:54.594 --> 01:37:56.303
Just tell me
what I have to do.

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:58.136
You have to go
to Bhutoria's office.

01:37:58.136 --> 01:37:58.803
Tomorrow.

01:37:58.803 --> 01:38:00.386
Bhutoria?
Is he a ghost too?

01:38:00.386 --> 01:38:01.178
No.

01:38:01.386 --> 01:38:03.928
A promoter.
The owner of Magic Realty.

01:38:04.094 --> 01:38:04.886
Hello?

01:38:05.303 --> 01:38:07.094
I'm speaking on behalf
of Magic Realty.

01:38:07.594 --> 01:38:10.511
Our office staff is facing issues
with their hard disks.

01:38:11.011 --> 01:38:12.803
No, we are unable
to save our files.

01:38:13.303 --> 01:38:14.803
Boss has already asked twice!

01:38:15.178 --> 01:38:16.511
But it's written
in the contract.

01:38:17.094 --> 01:38:18.803
My God, what's wrong
with this man?

01:38:18.928 --> 01:38:21.928
Please send someone immediately.

01:38:22.803 --> 01:38:23.344
How strange...

01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:26.428
Hi, babe,
I need to meet your boss.

01:38:26.636 --> 01:38:28.094
Where are you from?

01:38:28.094 --> 01:38:29.594
From far, far away.

01:38:29.636 --> 01:38:31.469
Sir's in a meeting.

01:38:31.469 --> 01:38:32.594
Can I take a message?

01:38:32.636 --> 01:38:35.928
Whether you give your boss a message
or a kiss, is your call.

01:38:36.094 --> 01:38:37.511
I have urgent business
wth him.

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:39.261
I just told you...
Sir is busy.

01:38:39.261 --> 01:38:41.636
I don't care.
Tell him it's urgent.

01:38:41.636 --> 01:38:42.303
Wait.

01:38:42.303 --> 01:38:44.428
Hello?
Mr. Guchait, come here right now!

01:38:44.428 --> 01:38:45.803
I don't have time to waste.

01:38:49.303 --> 01:38:50.928
What's wrong?

01:38:51.261 --> 01:38:54.386
He wants to meet sir urgently.

01:38:55.803 --> 01:38:58.011
- Bhuto-Bhuto--
- Who's Bhuto, huh?

01:38:58.261 --> 01:39:00.219
Bhuto-Bhutoria is busy.

01:39:00.344 --> 01:39:01.678
Why don't you tell me?

01:39:01.678 --> 01:39:03.261
Who are you, Johny?

01:39:03.261 --> 01:39:06.053
I am T-T-T. K. Guchait.

01:39:06.053 --> 01:39:08.678
You'll stop stammering
when you get punched in the nose!

01:39:09.303 --> 01:39:10.386
Finalise it at 25 lakhs.

01:39:10.386 --> 01:39:11.303
Hey, Bhuto!

01:39:11.303 --> 01:39:12.094
Yeah.

01:39:12.636 --> 01:39:13.344
Who is it?

01:39:13.678 --> 01:39:14.636
Kartik.

01:39:15.803 --> 01:39:17.136
It's important.

01:39:17.136 --> 01:39:18.928
The problem is yours,
the solution is mine.

01:39:18.928 --> 01:39:21.261
If you don't hear me out, it's your loss.
If you do, you profit.

01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:22.511
Profit?

01:39:23.303 --> 01:39:24.636
- Sit.
- Thank you.

01:39:25.428 --> 01:39:27.053
What a coincidence!

01:39:27.053 --> 01:39:31.969
Your name is Kartik
and my name is Ganesh.

01:39:32.053 --> 01:39:34.428
Ganesh Bhutoria.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:39.303
We are like the mythological brothers
Kartik and Ganesh.

01:39:39.553 --> 01:39:40.011
Yes?

01:39:40.011 --> 01:39:42.844
This guy is dangerous, sir.

01:39:42.844 --> 01:39:44.053
Okay, okay.

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.511
What?

01:39:45.636 --> 01:39:47.886
Did you get my character certficate?

01:39:47.886 --> 01:39:49.469
You're famous!

01:39:49.469 --> 01:39:51.386
You mean infamous.

01:39:52.094 --> 01:39:53.969
Everybody is scared
of one-armed Kartik.

01:39:54.636 --> 01:39:57.344
My hand got drilled
while trying to dodge a bullet.

01:39:57.386 --> 01:39:59.594
I used to measure my targets
through the hole.

01:39:59.761 --> 01:40:01.928
People started calling me
the "Hole Master".

01:40:02.261 --> 01:40:04.928
And then I lost
my entire hand.

01:40:05.511 --> 01:40:07.636
From the "Hole Master"
to "One-armed Kartik"!

01:40:08.344 --> 01:40:12.594
Tell me what I can do for you.

01:40:12.678 --> 01:40:14.511
I'll be the one
doing things for you!

01:40:14.594 --> 01:40:16.719
But not for free.
It'll be a give and take.

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:18.594
What do you mean?

01:40:20.469 --> 01:40:23.261
How much has Promod Prodhan asked for?

01:40:23.969 --> 01:40:26.303
How do you know
that he has asked for money?

01:40:26.303 --> 01:40:28.553
Let me guess,
One... right?

01:40:28.636 --> 01:40:31.094
One... as in?

01:40:31.594 --> 01:40:36.636
Why are you playing dumb, man?

01:40:36.636 --> 01:40:38.178
What do you want?

01:40:38.178 --> 01:40:41.386
Cut the crap...
I can make the settlement at 50 lakhs.

01:40:41.386 --> 01:40:42.844
I will keep four percent.

01:40:42.844 --> 01:40:45.386
You will be saving 48 lakhs.

01:40:45.386 --> 01:40:46.719
Really?

01:40:47.511 --> 01:40:51.428
One-armed Kartik never goes back
on his word.

01:40:51.719 --> 01:40:57.136
My political connections are very high.
I know Promod Prodhan's father too.

01:40:57.136 --> 01:40:59.719
You know his father too?

01:40:59.719 --> 01:41:01.719
- Not his real father.
- Oh.

01:41:02.219 --> 01:41:04.094
His godfather...
D. N. Chowdhury.

01:41:04.219 --> 01:41:06.761
He's a real big shot!

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.719
You saved me, Kartik.
Thank you.

01:41:10.011 --> 01:41:11.344
Mention not!

01:41:11.969 --> 01:41:15.011
Make sure you're at Chowdhury Palace
with 50 lakhs.

01:41:15.136 --> 01:41:16.719
At 10 o'clock.

01:41:17.011 --> 01:41:20.094
If you are lucky,
you might meet some rich, foreign clients.

01:41:20.178 --> 01:41:22.469
Rich, foreign clients?

01:41:22.469 --> 01:41:23.928
Wipes his a**
on dollar bills!

01:41:24.594 --> 01:41:25.969
They want to invest here.

01:41:25.969 --> 01:41:28.303
My God!
Foreign investors?

01:41:28.303 --> 01:41:31.511
Do you think I'm a
small-time guy?

01:41:32.178 --> 01:41:32.928
Okay.

01:41:33.428 --> 01:41:36.094
I'll leave in the morning
right after the religious cereremony.

01:41:36.094 --> 01:41:36.886
By 10 o'clock.

01:41:36.886 --> 01:41:38.636
Not in the morning.

01:41:38.761 --> 01:41:40.136
Such deals can't be done
in the day time!

01:41:40.136 --> 01:41:41.803
I meant 10 o'clock at night.

01:41:41.803 --> 01:41:43.553
Make sure you're alone.
And bring the money.

01:41:43.553 --> 01:41:46.844
Your sidekicks won't be allowed in.
The whole deal will be confidential.

01:41:47.136 --> 01:41:48.053
All alone?

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:49.969
I mean, my chauffeur will be there.

01:41:49.969 --> 01:41:52.136
You might be followed
if you come in your car.

01:41:52.219 --> 01:41:53.928
I'll send you a rickshaw.

01:41:53.969 --> 01:41:55.886
I'll have to go in a rickshaw?
Won't it be risky?

01:41:55.886 --> 01:41:57.219
You'll be carrying
a lot of money.

01:41:57.386 --> 01:41:59.386
With Atmaram around,
there'll be nothing to worry about.

01:41:59.803 --> 01:42:00.719
Atmaram?

01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:01.803
The rickshaw puller.

01:42:02.011 --> 01:42:03.594
Trustworthy man.

01:42:03.678 --> 01:42:05.886
He'll make sure you reach safely.

01:42:09.636 --> 01:42:11.678
He's here.
Very good.

01:42:11.678 --> 01:42:12.678
It's all set.

01:42:12.761 --> 01:42:13.469
D. N. Chowdhury?

01:42:13.469 --> 01:42:15.219
Everything's ready as planned.
He's upstairs.

01:42:15.219 --> 01:42:15.928
Come.

01:42:15.928 --> 01:42:18.136
- Got the cash?
- All of it.

01:42:18.136 --> 01:42:19.136
And the foreign client?

01:42:19.136 --> 01:42:20.553
Everyone's here.

01:42:20.636 --> 01:42:24.094
- I've arranged for some entertainment.
- That's great!

01:42:24.094 --> 01:42:28.803
And Bengalis celebrate so many festivals!

01:42:29.011 --> 01:42:30.136
Should I take off my shoes?

01:42:30.136 --> 01:42:31.719
There are different ways of doing things here.
Just come along.

01:42:31.719 --> 01:42:32.928
Okay.

01:42:34.636 --> 01:42:36.719
(song playing)

01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:37.553
Come, come.

01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:40.886
Wow!

01:42:41.178 --> 01:42:42.844
Is this a business meeting
or a party?

01:42:43.094 --> 01:42:46.344
They are all VIPs.
We have to entertain them.

01:42:46.344 --> 01:42:49.636
Meet D. N. Chowdhury.

01:42:49.636 --> 01:42:51.594
And you are?
Go on.

01:42:51.969 --> 01:42:53.678
Sir Richmond, from London.

01:42:53.678 --> 01:42:55.803
Hello.
Please be seated.

01:42:56.844 --> 01:42:57.928
Have a drink.

01:42:57.928 --> 01:42:58.678
Sir?

01:42:58.761 --> 01:42:59.428
Alcohol?

01:42:59.511 --> 01:43:01.594
Foreign liquor!
Tell me what you'll have.

01:43:02.136 --> 01:43:04.178
I don't drink.

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:06.803
Is he serious?

01:43:07.553 --> 01:43:10.053
And to think
I made so many arrangements.

01:43:10.844 --> 01:43:13.219
Sir, what is the name
of your company?

01:43:13.678 --> 01:43:15.386
East India Company.

01:43:15.469 --> 01:43:17.053
East India Company.

01:43:17.053 --> 01:43:18.178
Indian company?

01:43:18.469 --> 01:43:19.969
Famous company.

01:43:20.136 --> 01:43:21.969
It's bought over
almost the entire country!

01:43:22.553 --> 01:43:24.719
How much are you paying
for this house?

01:43:25.011 --> 01:43:27.053
About 10 crores.

01:43:28.053 --> 01:43:30.219
My entire land would be worth...

01:43:30.219 --> 01:43:32.553
- about five thousand--
- Crores!

01:43:32.928 --> 01:43:34.219
Five thousand crores!

01:43:34.219 --> 01:43:35.678
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

01:43:36.053 --> 01:43:37.094
Land?

01:43:37.094 --> 01:43:40.428
Tea estate.
Big shot!

01:43:42.469 --> 01:43:45.636
So, you don't like alcohol.
But you like chicks I hope.

01:43:45.844 --> 01:43:47.053
Chicks?

01:43:47.553 --> 01:43:48.928
As in, ladies?

01:43:49.428 --> 01:43:52.469
She is from a ladies bar.
What a babe!

01:43:52.636 --> 01:43:55.053
Her curves are
to die for!

01:43:55.053 --> 01:43:56.344
Like the Bollywood actress
Shilpa Shetty?

01:43:56.344 --> 01:43:58.219
This one's just shifted base
from Bollywood.

01:43:58.344 --> 01:44:00.136
Yours for the entire night.

01:44:00.928 --> 01:44:04.053
You want a little trailer
before the real film begins?

01:44:04.053 --> 01:44:05.094
Trailer?

01:44:06.053 --> 01:44:07.136
Hey, Shiuli!

01:44:12.844 --> 01:44:17.219
My body was on fire

01:44:17.511 --> 01:44:21.844
Waiting for you

01:44:22.928 --> 01:44:27.761
Come to me, my love

01:44:28.386 --> 01:44:33.303
Leave the world behind

01:44:50.428 --> 01:44:58.261
Light my body on fire

01:45:01.303 --> 01:45:05.303
Light my body on fire

01:45:05.303 --> 01:45:09.678
Boy you are a big traitor

01:45:12.428 --> 01:45:16.886
Boy you are a big traitor

01:45:19.886 --> 01:45:26.636
My heart keeps beating
My body keeps burning

01:45:26.803 --> 01:45:31.553
Boy you are a big traitor

01:45:32.261 --> 01:45:36.594
You are a big traitor

01:45:36.886 --> 01:45:39.803
Hey, pal!
The trailer's so hot!

01:45:39.803 --> 01:45:41.928
I'm sure the movie will be a hit.

01:45:42.053 --> 01:45:43.969
Can't just keep watching it.
You have to pay.

01:45:43.969 --> 01:45:46.594
I'll pay for sure.

01:46:06.511 --> 01:46:10.261
My beauty turned to ashes

01:46:10.553 --> 01:46:13.636
I was on fire

01:46:13.803 --> 01:46:17.761
My beauty turned to ashes

01:46:17.761 --> 01:46:21.178
I was on fire

01:46:21.386 --> 01:46:27.428
The unbearable flames
Took my breath away

01:46:27.928 --> 01:46:32.428
Boy you are a big traitor

01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:37.678
You are a big traitor

01:46:39.511 --> 01:46:42.636
Look at the babe
She's on fire, fire, fire

01:46:43.094 --> 01:46:46.469
Look at the babe
She's burning with desire

01:46:46.469 --> 01:46:50.053
She got, she got, she got
the fire inside her

01:46:50.053 --> 01:46:53.719
She's gonna, she's gonna
set this place on fire

01:46:56.553 --> 01:46:57.053
Yo!

01:47:00.178 --> 01:47:00.761
Yo!

01:47:03.803 --> 01:47:04.386
Yo!

01:47:07.303 --> 01:47:07.719
Yeah

01:47:07.719 --> 01:47:14.969
You hurt me more than you heal me
Why do you torment me?

01:47:14.969 --> 01:47:22.303
You hurt me more than you heal me
Why do you torment me?

01:47:22.511 --> 01:47:28.844
I won't let you go
Beware of me darling

01:47:29.136 --> 01:47:33.719
Boy you are a big traitor

01:47:34.636 --> 01:47:38.428
You are a big traitor

01:47:38.428 --> 01:47:40.511
Lift your veil girl,
let me see your face!

01:47:40.511 --> 01:47:43.886
You killed me with your fire

01:47:43.886 --> 01:47:47.219
You should face consequences dire

01:47:47.219 --> 01:47:48.636
A**hole!

01:47:49.678 --> 01:47:51.386
Laxmi?
You?

01:47:51.386 --> 01:47:53.219
- But you were...
- I was dead, right?

01:47:53.219 --> 01:47:55.386
You jerk!

01:47:55.553 --> 01:47:57.636
You burnt me to death
for dowry.

01:47:57.636 --> 01:47:59.136
Do you remember that,
you bastard?

01:48:00.053 --> 01:48:00.761
My God!
I'm going to die!

01:48:00.761 --> 01:48:02.636
I kept screaming
and shouting...

01:48:02.636 --> 01:48:04.469
Crying and begging...

01:48:05.553 --> 01:48:09.428
- Now you will scream and shout!
- The show isn't over my friend.

01:48:10.219 --> 01:48:14.761
I'm your husband!
Please don't kill me.

01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:17.678
Don't listen to him.
That's sentimental bulls**t!

01:48:17.886 --> 01:48:21.719
Here...
Keep all the money.

01:48:21.886 --> 01:48:23.094
I don't want the house
or anything else.

01:48:23.094 --> 01:48:25.178
My God!
He's worse than me!

01:48:25.178 --> 01:48:26.719
Bribing a ghost!

01:48:26.719 --> 01:48:30.303
I'm sure he'll do the same
with God.

01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:33.136
How about this...

01:48:33.136 --> 01:48:35.053
I'll pour whisky over him
while you light the fire.

01:48:36.428 --> 01:48:41.303
I must have sinned
in my past life.

01:48:41.386 --> 01:48:44.928
Now I have to spend the rest
of my life with these ghosts!

01:48:44.928 --> 01:48:45.886
Hey, one minute.
Put it out.

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:46.803
- Let the idiot go.
- What?

01:48:46.803 --> 01:48:48.928
Let him go?
Why?

01:48:49.844 --> 01:48:52.928
It's because of this jerk
that my raging spirit still roams about.

01:48:53.053 --> 01:48:55.761
I'll take of that your rage, sweetheart.
But get this...

01:48:56.136 --> 01:48:59.386
If we kill him,
he'll join us here.

01:48:59.678 --> 01:49:00.678
- Oh my God!
- Yeah.

01:49:00.678 --> 01:49:03.553
He has lost a lot of money.
He'll die of a heart attack anyway.

01:49:03.761 --> 01:49:07.344
Then he'll go straight to hell.
There'll be no disturbance here.

01:49:08.303 --> 01:49:10.594
Get lost!
I've spared you.

01:49:11.053 --> 01:49:12.469
And listen up!

01:49:13.303 --> 01:49:16.844
If I see you
around this house again...

01:49:17.053 --> 01:49:18.469
I'll strangle you!

01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:19.511
Run!

01:49:19.761 --> 01:49:20.428
Go!

01:49:20.428 --> 01:49:22.553
Hey!
Leave this.

01:49:22.594 --> 01:49:23.928
- Jerk.
- Get lost.

01:49:24.053 --> 01:49:28.469
The idiot was trying to buy
off Chowdhury Palace!

01:49:29.803 --> 01:49:31.761
Oh God!

01:49:31.928 --> 01:49:34.719
Dear Lord!

01:49:35.053 --> 01:49:37.511
Finally, the ghosts stood up
for themselves.

01:49:37.511 --> 01:49:40.053
History was created
at Chowdhury Palace.

01:49:40.303 --> 01:49:43.678
The history of how these helpless ghosts
turned the situation around.

01:49:43.928 --> 01:49:46.719
Atmaram, let's go.
Hurry up!

01:49:47.094 --> 01:49:50.303
Where do you want to go?
Up above, huh?

01:49:53.969 --> 01:49:56.011
He's a ghost too!

01:49:56.886 --> 01:49:59.219
Never come back!

01:49:59.386 --> 01:50:02.219
They got in touch
with Laxmi through Spookbook.

01:50:02.678 --> 01:50:05.969
She was sorrowfully roaming about
after being cruelly burnt to death.

01:50:06.428 --> 01:50:08.469
She instantly agreed.

01:50:09.178 --> 01:50:11.928
But there was trouble
with the hot dance number.

01:50:12.386 --> 01:50:16.428
Laxmi was a homely girl,
she wasn't used to being flirtatious.

01:50:16.719 --> 01:50:17.386
Kadalibala!

01:50:17.428 --> 01:50:18.511
Exactly!

01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:21.428
Under her guidance,
Laxmi got pretty good at it.

01:50:21.636 --> 01:50:23.636
But the lyrics were written
by Laxmi herself.

01:50:23.636 --> 01:50:24.386
Yes.

01:50:24.594 --> 01:50:28.386
At first, the lyrics seem to be full
of sexual innuendos.

01:50:28.511 --> 01:50:32.886
But then you realise
that the words are literal, not metaphorical.

01:50:33.136 --> 01:50:35.178
"Light my body
on fire".

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:37.428
That's exactly
how she was killed.

01:50:39.094 --> 01:50:41.719
Now, tell me...

01:50:42.428 --> 01:50:43.969
How did you like my story?

01:50:43.969 --> 01:50:46.386
It's fantastic.
No doubt about that.

01:50:46.719 --> 01:50:50.636
Has a lot of drama, suspense,
comic relief...

01:50:51.303 --> 01:50:54.053
There's a crisis
and a resolution.

01:50:54.178 --> 01:50:56.136
And there's a hot
dance number.

01:50:57.636 --> 01:51:00.469
But there's a problem.

01:51:01.678 --> 01:51:06.136
The basic story line is a little weird,
bordering on the Absurd.

01:51:06.511 --> 01:51:10.636
It might be a little difficult
to pitch it to the producer.

01:51:11.261 --> 01:51:11.928
Hang on.

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.636
Do you know
what these are?

01:51:18.094 --> 01:51:19.386
Take a look
at them.

01:51:32.428 --> 01:51:37.386
They're old coins
of the East India Company.

01:51:37.594 --> 01:51:39.178
Antique!

01:51:39.761 --> 01:51:42.178
Not just antique,
they're priceless too.

01:51:42.678 --> 01:51:46.178
These will come handy
to start your film.

01:51:46.719 --> 01:51:48.178
Keep these with you.

01:51:48.178 --> 01:51:50.178
The rest of the money can
also be organised.

01:51:51.219 --> 01:51:52.886
Hold on a minute...

01:51:55.428 --> 01:51:56.803
Who exactly are you?

01:51:57.928 --> 01:51:59.469
You gave me a story
for a film...

01:51:59.469 --> 01:52:02.136
And now you are arranging
for money!

01:52:02.928 --> 01:52:05.428
I've been listening to your story
all this while but didn't get your name.

01:52:05.553 --> 01:52:06.011
Oh--

01:52:06.094 --> 01:52:07.761
I'm Ayan Sengupta.

01:52:08.053 --> 01:52:10.844
I was a Physics professor.

01:52:11.386 --> 01:52:14.636
In the 1970s, I had lost faith
in parliamentary democracy...

01:52:14.636 --> 01:52:17.053
And joined extreme Left politics.

01:52:17.094 --> 01:52:20.511
The party went underground
and so did I.

01:52:20.803 --> 01:52:22.761
I used to work
out of town.

01:52:22.844 --> 01:52:25.886
One day, I had gone home
to visit my ailing mother.

01:52:26.136 --> 01:52:28.219
The police was looking for me.

01:52:28.303 --> 01:52:30.136
They put me behind bars.

01:52:30.219 --> 01:52:32.303
Then began their
"third degree" treatment.

01:52:32.344 --> 01:52:34.136
But I was adamant.

01:52:34.303 --> 01:52:36.719
I didn't give out the names
of my comrades.

01:52:37.011 --> 01:52:37.511
At last...

01:52:38.053 --> 01:52:39.178
in the middle
of the night...

01:52:39.344 --> 01:52:41.053
They took me to a field
and said...

01:52:41.178 --> 01:52:42.678
"Go.
We are letting you go."

01:52:43.011 --> 01:52:44.803
Run!

01:52:50.844 --> 01:52:54.261
As I began running
they shot me from behind.

01:52:54.469 --> 01:52:58.594
The state goons anounced...
"Encounter death".

01:52:58.886 --> 01:52:59.969
You are...

01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:03.428
My name is Biplab.
Biplab Dasgupta.

01:53:04.178 --> 01:53:06.886
Biplab Dasgupta!

01:53:07.178 --> 01:53:08.094
Yes.

01:53:08.719 --> 01:53:11.303
I was the one who was murdered
in the revolution of the Seventies.

01:53:11.678 --> 01:53:12.344
What?

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:15.136
What nonsense!

01:53:17.553 --> 01:53:19.261
I agree that you have acted well.

01:53:19.261 --> 01:53:21.511
But the plot is not convincing.

01:53:22.678 --> 01:53:24.136
You don't believe me, right?

01:53:24.553 --> 01:53:25.636
No.

01:53:27.303 --> 01:53:28.469
Very well.

01:53:29.844 --> 01:53:30.844
Curtain call!

01:54:06.886 --> 01:54:08.178
Yes, Sumit?

01:54:08.303 --> 01:54:12.594
Sorry, I had dozed off...
Yes, I'll come down.

01:54:12.594 --> 01:54:15.553
You seem to be having a great time!
Taking naps and stuff.

01:54:15.886 --> 01:54:18.094
I, on the other hand,
got screwed.

01:54:18.428 --> 01:54:20.136
I just dozed off
for a bit, that's all.

01:54:20.136 --> 01:54:23.094
But your delay was a blessing
in disguise.

01:54:23.261 --> 01:54:24.178
Why are you talking
in riddles?

01:54:24.844 --> 01:54:25.719
What do you mean?

01:54:26.678 --> 01:54:31.136
I got a fantastic plot
for my feature film in a dream.

01:54:32.094 --> 01:54:33.803
You must be smoking
way too much...

01:54:33.803 --> 01:54:39.469
Getting plot ideas
in your dreams!

01:54:39.844 --> 01:54:41.261
I was very tensed.

01:54:41.261 --> 01:54:43.386
I have a meeting
with a producer tomorrow.

01:54:43.386 --> 01:54:45.011
The story was just not working.

01:54:45.053 --> 01:54:45.636
Whatever.

01:54:45.636 --> 01:54:48.094
Get in touch
with Guinness Book.

01:54:48.136 --> 01:54:49.094
They will fund you...

01:54:49.094 --> 01:54:51.261
The first ever film
to be conceived in a dream.

01:54:51.469 --> 01:54:53.428
Can I bum a smoke?

01:54:59.428 --> 01:55:00.719
What's wrong?
Give me a cigarette.

01:55:07.094 --> 01:55:08.886
What's this?

01:55:09.428 --> 01:55:10.678
Wait a minute.
2125
00:00:00,-41 --&gt; 01:56:16,250
THREE MONTHS LATER

01:55:38.386 --> 01:55:40.511
Won't there be
an opening ceremony?

01:55:40.511 --> 01:55:44.261
The director's an atheist.
Doesn't believe in God, rituals or ghosts.

01:55:44.261 --> 01:55:47.344
But he's named his film
"The Future of the Ghosts"!

01:55:47.428 --> 01:55:50.053
He says that these ceremonies
are a waste of time.

01:55:50.094 --> 01:55:53.053
It's been two hours
and we haven't yet started.

01:55:53.053 --> 01:55:55.844
The director's very finicky.

01:55:55.844 --> 01:55:57.636
A perfectionist.

01:55:58.011 --> 01:56:00.053
Ayan, get going, bro.

01:56:00.136 --> 01:56:01.511
- Rinka, shall we go?
- Yup.

01:56:01.511 --> 01:56:03.261
- Sumit, are we ready?
- Yes, let's go.

01:56:03.261 --> 01:56:04.428
- Yup, okay, wonderful.
- Silence!

01:56:04.428 --> 01:56:05.761
- Roll sound.
- Fans off.

01:56:06.344 --> 01:56:07.094
Rolling.

01:56:07.094 --> 01:56:07.761
Clapping frame.

01:56:08.178 --> 01:56:08.886
THE FUTURE OF THE PAST

01:56:08.886 --> 01:56:09.553
Camera.

01:56:10.594 --> 01:56:11.178
Rolling.

01:56:11.178 --> 01:56:12.928
"The Future of the Past".
shot by 1 by 1 by 1.

01:56:13.469 --> 01:56:14.094
Clap!

01:56:15.011 --> 01:56:16.053
Action!
Let's go.

01:56:22.636 --> 01:56:22.969
Cut.
