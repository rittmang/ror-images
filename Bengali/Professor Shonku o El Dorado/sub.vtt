00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.308
Good evening.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.267
No time to chat today, Tarak.
Very busy.

00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:50.850
A cup of tea for me.

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.475
Won't take too much of your time.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.433
What's it this time?

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:00.767
Is it a story or an essay?

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:02.558
Neither.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:11.600
What is this?

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:14.725
- It's a diary.
- Diary?

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:17.058
Give it a read.

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:19.933
Gold mine!

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:29.433
Professor T. Shanku.
2016... 2?

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:31.850
Maybe, this was his second diary
of that year.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.100
But does the name sound familiar?

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.892
T. Shanku?

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:39.517
Meaning?

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:42.017
Trilokeshwar Shanku.

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.392
Scientist and inventor.

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:46.517
He used to live in Giridih.

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:49.225
He's been missing for a few years now.

00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:51.517
But this is a recent diary. 2016.

00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:58.308
The initial rumours were that he lost his life
during a very dangerous experiment.

00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:00.558
But I've also heard...

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.475
he's hiding in an undisclosed location
in India...

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.933
and continuing his work
in secret.

00:04:09.142 --> 00:04:11.850
He'll reveal himself at the right time.

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:17.225
The diary's date makes
the second option seem correct.

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:19.558
But where did you find this?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.683
Remember the meteorite
that hit the Suderbans?

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:25.350
Meteorite...the Sunderbans...

00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:26.392
Oh ho!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:31.058
A meteorite crashed in the Mathariya area
about three months back.

00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:32.642
How can you forget already?

00:04:32.683 --> 00:04:35.100
Oh, yes! Correct!
I remember now.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.767
The media went crazy.

00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:38.142
Of course, they did.

00:04:38.183 --> 00:04:39.850
It was a huge stone.

00:04:39.892 --> 00:04:42.725
- But how is this diary--
- Related?

00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:45.475
I'll tell you, brother...

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:50.892
So, I had gone to the place...

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:52.975
To Mathariya?

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:27.350
<i>First, I found an monitor lizard's skin.</i>

00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:33.475
<i>I thought, since so many animals have died,
I might find some tiger skins too.</i>

00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:35.683
<i>You get really good price for it.</i>

00:05:35.683 --> 00:05:38.975
<i>But I was too late.</i>

00:05:39.017 --> 00:05:41.392
<i>Didn't even find a deer.</i>

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:44.808
<i>- Then what happened?
- Then...</i>

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.183
<i>You found the diary in the meteorite crater?</i>

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.767
Does that mean...

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:09.183
You won't find the answer
to that mystery in there.

00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:11.350
You can read it
if you want.

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:13.642
You people are used to making up stories.

00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:15.267
I write too.

00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:20.017
This is much more interesting
and adventurous.

00:06:20.808 --> 00:06:22.350
Not just that...

00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:25.600
The ink that has been used
to write in this diary...

00:06:25.642 --> 00:06:28.267
It's a strange ink.

00:06:28.558 --> 00:06:29.433
How?

00:06:29.433 --> 00:06:31.225
You've seen the diary.

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:33.892
What's the colour of the ink?

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:35.808
Why? It's black.

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:38.683
Open it and see.

00:06:38.808 --> 00:06:40.558
Take another look.

00:06:43.808 --> 00:06:44.850
What?

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:47.933
This is...
But it was just...

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:49.392
Didn't I tell you...

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.725
An ageless inventor!

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.225
Now stare at the writing for some time.

00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:18.267
I would have never parted with it,
you know.

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:23.642
I'm under a lot of financial stress,
that's why.

00:07:35.808 --> 00:07:37.183
Thank you.

00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:40.267
May God bless you.

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:42.767
Goodbye.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.350
Yeah, tell me.

00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:52.475
<i>Is the proof ready, Samaresh?</i>

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:53.892
What?

00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:55.017
<i>The proof?</i>

00:07:57.308 --> 00:07:59.308
Oh, yes...

00:07:59.558 --> 00:08:02.725
Meet me in an hour.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.058
<i>Okay.</i>

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.017
<i>May, 1st.</i>

00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:47.808
<i>Today, I finally received the new issue
of the "Cosmos" magazine.</i>

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:54.433
<i>This famous Swedish journal
has printed one of my essays.</i>

00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:59.933
<i>I had discussed all my inventions
in the essay.</i>

00:09:00.683 --> 00:09:04.433
<i>I had never done this before.</i>

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:10.808
<i>Although, I've received many requests
from various publications from all over the world.</i>

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:15.642
<i>I had to reject them all
due to lack of time.</i>

00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:22.142
<i>I have cut down a lot
on my research work nowadays.</i>

00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:28.725
<i>I have realised that in a place like Giridih...</i>

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:32.683
<i>with the limited resources of my laboratory...</i>

00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:36.433
<i>it's not like nothing can be achieved today...</i>

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:39.392
<i>but there's no need.</i>

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:45.267
<i>However, I had the opportunity
to explain something in this essay.</i>

00:09:45.308 --> 00:09:53.558
<i>The reason I did not make my inventions
public to the world.</i>

00:09:53.683 --> 00:09:56.350
<i>There's just one reason.</i>

00:09:56.392 --> 00:10:02.600
<i>My most important inventions...</i>

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:07.517
<i>like the Annihilin Pistol or the Miracurall medicine...</i>

00:10:07.558 --> 00:10:11.100
<i>or the Omniscope or the Microsonograph...</i>

00:10:11.142 --> 00:10:15.267
<i>or the memory revival machine, Remembrane...</i>

00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:19.308
<i>None of these can be built in a factory.</i>

00:10:19.558 --> 00:10:23.683
<i>These are all human handiwork.</i>

00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:28.183
<i>And there is only man who can do it.</i>

00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:32.058
<i>And that's Trilokeshwar Shanku.</i>

00:12:44.558 --> 00:12:45.975
<i>Congratulations!</i>

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:51.225
<i>Your article in the "Cosmos" magazine
has caused quite a stir in the world of science.</i>

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:52.517
Is that so?

00:12:52.558 --> 00:12:53.558
<i>Yeah, yeah!</i>

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.183
<i>And the people that know you...</i>

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:58.392
<i>They are all saying
what you've done is incredible!</i>

00:12:58.433 --> 00:13:01.892
<i>Considering the little resources
you've down there at Giridih.</i>

00:13:01.933 --> 00:13:06.350
<i>Take for example, the very means by which
we're presently communicating.</i>

00:13:06.392 --> 00:13:08.392
<i>This is also your invention.</i>

00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:11.683
Holocon: holographic conference.

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:13.350
<i>Now, let's cut to the chase.</i>

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:17.600
<i>You've heard of Sao Paolo's famous Ratantan Institute,
I presume.</i>

00:13:17.642 --> 00:13:19.183
Of course, I have.

00:13:19.225 --> 00:13:22.350
<i>It's president, Professor Emilia Rodriguez...</i>

00:13:22.392 --> 00:13:24.267
<i>is a good friend to both of us.</i>

00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:27.017
<i>And we've talked to her
earlier this morning.</i>

00:13:27.058 --> 00:13:29.808
<i>And she told us she has read your article.</i>

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.517
<i>And obviously she is fascinated.</i>

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:36.267
<i>Now, let me tell you
about the decision she has taken.</i>

00:13:36.308 --> 00:13:40.517
<i>Coming August, a science conference
is being organised in Sao Paolo.</i>

00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:43.725
<i>From the 25th to the 28th.</i>

00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:46.933
<i>It'll be the usual seminars
and panel discussions.</i>

00:13:46.975 --> 00:13:50.100
<i>And besides all that,
on the last day of the conference...</i>

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:53.017
<i>the institute will present you
with a doctorate.</i>

00:13:53.058 --> 00:13:54.058
What?

00:13:54.142 --> 00:13:57.142
<i>And wait!
It doesn't end there.</i>

00:13:57.225 --> 00:14:01.808
<i>An exhibition is being planned
to showcase some of your favourite inventions</i>

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.392
<i>alongwith their
necessary research papers.</i>

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:08.100
And you two are invited
to the conference, I hope.

00:14:08.183 --> 00:14:13.433
<i>Of course. Emilia will be sending the official invitations
by email as well as by post.</i>

00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:15.975
I've never been to Brazil.

00:14:16.017 --> 00:14:17.308
<i>Yes, we know.</i>

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.100
<i>And when we told her that...</i>

00:14:19.142 --> 00:14:22.225
<i>she said that our stay won't end
in just three days.</i>

00:14:22.267 --> 00:14:26.600
<i>They're organising a week's tour of Brazil
after the conference is over.</i>

00:14:26.642 --> 00:14:30.933
Oh, that's wonderful!
I couldn't have asked for anything better.

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:33.392
<i>Alright. Let us know
when you get the invitation.</i>

00:14:33.433 --> 00:14:37.142
<i>And we'll contact you
with any additional information.</i>

00:14:37.183 --> 00:14:39.308
Great! Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.933
<i>Bye, Shanku. Take care.
</i>

00:14:41.058 --> 00:14:44.475
<i>- 'Auf wiedersehen'. Bye, Jeremy.
- Bye, Will.</i>

00:15:06.475 --> 00:15:09.767
A gentleman is here to meet you.

00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:11.558
Which nationality?

00:15:11.558 --> 00:15:13.433
I didn't ask.

00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.683
But he is wearing a dhoti and cotton kurta.

00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:18.725
And he spoke in Bengali.

00:15:19.017 --> 00:15:20.017
What did he say?

00:15:20.058 --> 00:15:24.475
Tell your master to stop reading the article
in "kishmish".

00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:26.433
And spare ten minutes of his time.

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:28.683
He wants to tell you something.

00:15:32.017 --> 00:15:34.517
- Ask him to sit in the verandah.
- Okay, sir.

00:15:39.725 --> 00:15:41.767
Hello, Tilu.

00:15:46.975 --> 00:15:51.558
I apologize for interrupting
your reading of "Cosmos".

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.350
I've come here with the deep desire
to discuss certain things with you.

00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:59.808
I'm sure you'll listen to my request.

00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:03.225
- Sit.
- Yes.

00:16:10.392 --> 00:16:13.558
You must be a little surprised.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.308
The fact that I've written in "Cosmos"...

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.642
No one here knows about that.

00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:26.683
And only my father called me Tilu.

00:16:27.058 --> 00:16:30.892
After he passed away,
the nickname had no use.

00:16:31.683 --> 00:16:34.600
My name is Nakur Chandra Biswas.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.850
I live in Makardah.

00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:40.642
I could see you in front of me
for the last few days.

00:16:40.725 --> 00:16:44.808
But that and this is not the same thing.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.600
You could see me?

00:16:49.058 --> 00:16:51.142
What do you mean?

00:16:51.392 --> 00:16:54.267
It's been like this
for the last one and half months.

00:16:54.308 --> 00:16:57.183
People from different places,
events from different places...

00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:00.350
I can suddenly see these things.

00:17:00.392 --> 00:17:04.767
Although, it's not very clear.
But I can still see.

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:06.892
I've heard your name.

00:17:06.933 --> 00:17:09.142
I've seen your photo in the newspapers too.

00:17:09.183 --> 00:17:13.600
The moment I tried to remember what you looked like
you were right there in front of me.

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:15.892
Hmm.

00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:21.350
And this has been going on
for a month and a half?

00:17:21.725 --> 00:17:26.475
Almost a month and a half.

00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:29.225
<i>It was raining very heavily that day.</i>

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:30.600
<i>It was afternoon.</i>

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:32.600
<i>My brother was at the school.</i>

00:17:32.683 --> 00:17:35.225
<i>He teaches in Makardah Primary School.</i>

00:17:35.433 --> 00:17:36.808
<i>Our mother has passed away.</i>

00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:40.350
<i>My father was at Noni Ghosh's house
playing chess.</i>

00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:44.517
<i>I was having some tamarind chutney
in my room.</i>

00:17:44.683 --> 00:17:46.683
<i>Suddenly, I see.</i>

00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:54.350
<i>In all probablity...
</i>

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.017
you are talking about ball lightning.

00:18:57.267 --> 00:18:58.767
Ball lightning?

00:18:58.808 --> 00:19:01.892
It's a very rare event.
But it does happen.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:06.517
But if that electricity passes
very close to a person...

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:10.725
and if certain changes are seen in the person
because of that...

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:13.308
then nothing else could be said.

00:19:13.683 --> 00:19:16.475
On that note, would you like some coffee?

00:19:16.558 --> 00:19:19.683
Would hate to disturb Prahlad...

00:19:19.683 --> 00:19:22.267
It's no bother at all.
I'll give you company.

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:25.850
Prahlad! Prahlad!

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.267
Coming, sir.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.142
Please bring us two coffees.

00:19:29.183 --> 00:19:35.183
3-8-8-8-9-1-7-1...

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.017
Nakur?

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.892
3-8-8-8-9-1-7-1.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.933
The news of death in the paper.

00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:53.183
The wall on the right
of the victim's table...

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.267
<i>There's a painting.</i>

00:19:59.308 --> 00:20:02.892
<i>Hidden behind it is a safe.</i>

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.142
<i>And the number you mentioned?</i>

00:20:05.183 --> 00:20:07.808
<i>That's the passkey
to open the safe.</i>

00:20:07.892 --> 00:20:12.475
<i>If you enter the number
the safe will open.</i>

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.642
<i>It's stuffed with legal documents...</i>

00:20:20.683 --> 00:20:25.558
important papers
and bundles of dollar notes.

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:29.642
Please don't mind me, Tilu.

00:20:29.683 --> 00:20:34.350
I don't want to waste your precious time
by talking about all this...

00:20:34.392 --> 00:20:36.475
Not at all!

00:20:36.558 --> 00:20:39.558
You have a rare gift.

00:20:39.975 --> 00:20:45.892
Any scientist would be fortunate
to meet you.

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:48.850
I just want to know...

00:20:48.892 --> 00:20:53.767
What are the other traits that developed in me
after I came in contact with the ball lightning?

00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:55.433
- Am I right?
- Absolutely!

00:20:55.475 --> 00:21:00.392
Problem is I don't consider
these special abilities.

00:21:00.642 --> 00:21:03.433
It's as normal as breathing.

00:21:03.475 --> 00:21:07.558
I'm not thinking about it as special ability
while I'm doing it.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:12.558
For example, on the table in front of you...

00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:22.808
What? What can you see?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:29.350
A brass Budhha statue...

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:35.683
It's not very clear...
just an illusion.

00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:46.142
Like I said...

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.392
I'm still not very good at it.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.767
<i>The statue is in Makardah.</i>

00:21:52.142 --> 00:21:55.183
<i>It's in our lawyer,
Shibratan Mallik's chamber.</i>

00:21:55.225 --> 00:21:56.892
<i>I've seen it only once.</i>

00:21:56.933 --> 00:22:00.600
I imagined it on your table.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.975
But it didn't completely show up.

00:22:04.892 --> 00:22:09.267
I could see you often...

00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:12.767
that's why I thought
I'll visit you in Giridih.

00:22:12.808 --> 00:22:14.808
I'll have chat with you...

00:22:14.808 --> 00:22:16.642
- Here you go.
- Yes...

00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:24.433
I wanted to warn you about something.

00:22:25.767 --> 00:22:28.683
- Warning!
- Pardon my insolence.

00:22:29.392 --> 00:22:34.683
I know you don't just belong to this country.
You're respected through out the world.

00:22:35.308 --> 00:22:41.058
You're invited all over the world
and you must respond to those invitations.

00:22:41.142 --> 00:22:48.308
But if you attend the Sao Paulo conference,
I'd request you to be especially careful.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.392
What about Sao Paulo?

00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:52.558
I can't tell you that.

00:22:53.183 --> 00:22:57.225
It's still not very clear to me yet.

00:22:57.267 --> 00:23:04.183
And to tell you the truth,
I don't even know where Sao Paulo is.

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:11.267
Sao Paulo is the biggest city
in South America's biggest country, Brazil.

00:23:11.308 --> 00:23:16.767
Oh, I suddenly saw...

00:23:23.058 --> 00:23:25.225
My heart shuddered.

00:23:25.267 --> 00:23:27.558
And the very next moment I saw...

00:23:27.642 --> 00:23:30.642
- What did you see?
- A garden...

00:23:30.683 --> 00:23:32.975
<i>And a beautiful restaurant in it...</i>

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:40.308
<i>That man didn't have a good aura.</i>

00:23:41.225 --> 00:23:43.350
- Where are you putting up?
- Huh?

00:23:43.392 --> 00:23:45.058
Where are you staying?

00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:47.308
Hotel Manorama.

00:23:47.558 --> 00:23:48.558
How long will you stay?

00:23:48.558 --> 00:23:52.808
My work here is done.
So...

00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:55.100
How can I get in touch with you?

00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:59.808
Well, I have a mobile phone.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:00.975
- You do?
- Yes.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.100
Then give me your number.

00:24:08.558 --> 00:24:11.183
Let me give you a call instead.

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:14.183
I have your number saved.

00:24:14.225 --> 00:24:17.058
How do you have my number?

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.267
Oh!

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.267
I should have guessed.
Please go ahead.

00:24:34.142 --> 00:24:37.433
I've saved your number as well.

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:40.767
Tell me something.

00:24:40.808 --> 00:24:41.808
What?

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:45.475
Would you go abroad
if you get the opportunity?

00:24:46.308 --> 00:24:48.558
Abroad? Me?

00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:53.225
It means a lot
that you've even considered me.

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:55.975
I don't need anything else.

00:24:56.017 --> 00:24:58.017
Please accept my salutations!

00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:06.725
And my blessings for Newton.

00:25:07.808 --> 00:25:09.350
<i>It's unbelieveable!</i>

00:25:09.392 --> 00:25:14.308
<i>Mr. Biswas seems to have been blessed
with the power of hypnotism...</i>

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.933
<i>telepathy and clairvoyance.</i>

00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:21.183
<i>Tell me, do you believe in his theory
about ball lightning?</i>

00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:23.267
What other explaination can there be?

00:25:23.308 --> 00:25:24.683
<i>To be honest...</i>

00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:28.850
<i>I've read about instances
where by being close to a lightning strike</i>

00:25:28.892 --> 00:25:32.142
<i>the deaf could hear again...
The blind could see again but...</i>

00:25:32.642 --> 00:25:36.058
Anyway, I've got the email
from Sao Paulo.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.808
<i>Oh, I'm glad to hear it!</i>

00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:39.600
<i>Listen, Shanku...</i>

00:25:39.642 --> 00:25:44.350
<i>Why don't you take Mr. Biswas along with you
to Sao Paulo as your secretary?</i>

00:25:44.433 --> 00:25:47.600
<i>God, Wil! Instead of being a scientist
you should have been...</i>

00:25:47.642 --> 00:25:50.933
<i>Oh, no, no, sorry, Jeremy.
But I have an open mind.</i>

00:25:50.975 --> 00:25:52.392
<i>I'm not joking, Shanku.</i>

00:25:52.433 --> 00:25:56.558
<i>If you take him along with you
we can see a demonstration of his powers.</i>

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.058
<i>And above that, he can participate
on some TV talk shows...</i>

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.558
<i>And he will return to his place
with some money in his pocket.</i>

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.892
<i>Come on. Think about it.</i>

00:26:05.975 --> 00:26:06.683
Let's see.

00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:10.058
If I find him excited at the prospect,
I'll let you know.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.100
<i>Okay, that's that!</i>

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.933
<i>- Keep us posted. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:16.308
Bye.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.142
Tell me, Nakur.

00:26:20.558 --> 00:26:23.475
The invitation is already here
from Sao Paulo.

00:26:23.475 --> 00:26:24.350
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

00:26:25.558 --> 00:26:26.642
Actually...

00:26:26.683 --> 00:26:31.683
<i>I was feeling a little awkward at the prospect
of going abroad with you at first.</i>

00:26:31.683 --> 00:26:34.100
<i>But now gradually
I've come to realise...</i>

00:26:34.767 --> 00:26:38.850
that if I'm not there with you
at Sao Paulo, you'll be...

00:26:38.892 --> 00:26:40.600
<i>in great danger. That's why...</i>

00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:43.517
Well then, I'll let them know.

00:26:43.558 --> 00:26:47.600
That my secretary, NC Biswas
will be travelling with me.

00:26:47.642 --> 00:26:51.683
And a separate invitation
should be sent for him.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.558
SREEGURU LIBRARY

00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:15.100
<i>One more thing...</i>

00:28:15.475 --> 00:28:19.350
<i>At least, three days before leaving
that is August 22nd...</i>

00:28:19.558 --> 00:28:21.683
<i>It would be great
if you could come to Giridih.</i>

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:27.058
<i>We must evaluate your sensibilities.</i>

00:28:34.558 --> 00:28:36.558
Welcome! Welcome!

00:28:38.558 --> 00:28:40.183
Good morning, Tilu!

00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:43.558
Good morning.

00:28:43.642 --> 00:28:47.642
You are looking great.

00:28:48.558 --> 00:28:50.600
Result of praticising yoga.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.433
Take a seat.
Two coffees, please.

00:28:52.475 --> 00:28:53.267
Yes, sir.

00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:57.392
What else have you been doing?

00:28:57.433 --> 00:29:00.433
My English is more fluent now.

00:29:00.475 --> 00:29:05.142
And I've learnt Pitman's short hand method.

00:29:05.183 --> 00:29:10.850
And I've read a few books on etiquettes
to get used to the culture abroad.

00:29:10.892 --> 00:29:13.642
Your letter of recommendation
helped me get the passport.

00:29:13.683 --> 00:29:15.600
And see this.

00:29:21.225 --> 00:29:23.475
Apart from the suit
I got from Kolkata...

00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:30.267
I also got shirts, tie, handkerchief,
shoes and socks.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.600
I've made you spend a lot of money.

00:29:33.642 --> 00:29:36.517
Don't worry about it.

00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:40.225
My father, his friend Noni Ghosh,
lawyer Shibratan Mallik...

00:29:40.267 --> 00:29:42.183
Everyone has heard of you.

00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:45.808
They were so happy
that I was going abroad with you...

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.142
that they lent me some money.

00:29:48.225 --> 00:29:52.267
And my brother lent me this suitcase.

00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:56.142
Did you have to buy this too?

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.725
What to do?
I normally use neem stems.

00:30:04.308 --> 00:30:05.392
<i>Nakur...
</i>

00:30:05.433 --> 00:30:06.267
Yes?

00:30:06.308 --> 00:30:09.350
You might want to read it.
Might find it helpful.

00:30:13.058 --> 00:30:15.850
- I won't need it.
- What do you mean?

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:23.350
I found an old book with pictures
in my local library about Brazil.

00:30:23.392 --> 00:30:25.933
I have read it cover to cover.

00:30:26.267 --> 00:30:28.267
There's only one problem.

00:30:28.767 --> 00:30:30.642
And what might that be?

00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:33.600
I can still speak a little bit of English.

00:30:33.642 --> 00:30:38.308
The book said the official language
of Brazil is Portuguese. That is...

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.808
You don't have to worry about that.
I'm here.

00:30:42.183 --> 00:30:43.725
You know Portuguese too?

00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:48.058
Considering the deep impact
of the Portuguese culture on Indian history...

00:30:48.308 --> 00:30:50.142
When I was 11 years old...

00:30:50.183 --> 00:30:56.850
I had learned the language from Portuguese Pastor,
Father Rebello.

00:30:57.183 --> 00:31:00.308
Which is why I consider you such a genius.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.642
Will we travel to the forests of Brazil?

00:31:03.683 --> 00:31:06.350
They have promised to take us around.

00:31:06.392 --> 00:31:08.517
Will forests be excluded?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.892
I have read about the forests there.

00:31:11.933 --> 00:31:17.725
It talks about a species of snake
that is double the size of a python.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.767
- Anaconda.
- Correct. Exactly that.

00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:34.517
- Welcome to Brazil.
- Jeremy, it's been a long time.

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:35.683
Oh yes!

00:31:35.725 --> 00:31:38.808
- Shanku!
- Wilhelm!

00:31:39.933 --> 00:31:42.183
- You look good... Thank you.
- And you too.

00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:45.642
This is Mr. Lobo.
He's Emilia's secretary.

00:31:45.767 --> 00:31:47.475
- 'Olá'!
- Hi!

00:31:47.558 --> 00:31:48.683
It's an honour, sir.

00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:49.142
Thank you.

00:31:49.183 --> 00:31:52.392
He has been given the burden
of looking after us.

00:31:52.433 --> 00:31:53.808
Really?

00:31:54.225 --> 00:31:56.892
And this is the great NC Biswas.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.600
- Hi!
- Hello.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:31:59.725
Yes.

00:31:59.892 --> 00:32:02.975
They are my closest and oldest friends.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.392
They can't speak Bengali
but they understand it quite well.

00:32:07.433 --> 00:32:09.433
A little bit.

00:32:09.892 --> 00:32:11.100
Jeremy Saunders.

00:32:11.142 --> 00:32:11.850
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:32:11.892 --> 00:32:12.933
Wilhelm Kroll.

00:32:12.975 --> 00:32:14.975
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello--

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:17.142
What's wrong?

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:23.850
Alps...

00:32:25.225 --> 00:32:27.225
Bavarian Alps...

00:32:28.225 --> 00:32:32.267
You and two young men...

00:32:32.308 --> 00:32:33.725
The year 1972...

00:32:33.808 --> 00:32:35.058
Climbing...

00:32:35.183 --> 00:32:36.225
Climbing...

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.142
Then slipping...slipping...slipping...

00:32:40.308 --> 00:32:41.350
Then...oh...

00:32:42.017 --> 00:32:42.933
Bad...

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.683
Very bad.

00:32:45.475 --> 00:32:47.683
<i>My foot slipped.
(in German)</i>

00:32:47.725 --> 00:32:51.100
<i>Trying to save my life...
</i>

00:32:51.142 --> 00:32:57.808
<i>Hermann and Karl lost theirs.</i>

00:33:01.683 --> 00:33:03.100
He's saying...

00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:07.142
Two of his friends in an attempt to save him...

00:33:07.725 --> 00:33:12.892
The entire incident played out
in front of my eyes.

00:33:13.683 --> 00:33:15.267
I didn't want to say anything.

00:33:15.308 --> 00:33:18.017
It's a very tragic incident.

00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:21.725
Excuse me. The car is waiting for us.

00:33:21.808 --> 00:33:24.267
Come... Let's go.

00:33:25.642 --> 00:33:26.892
Come, Wil.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.933
Did you know about this event of Wil's youth?

00:33:33.308 --> 00:33:34.392
No.

00:34:32.975 --> 00:34:34.392
Mr. Biswas.

00:34:35.058 --> 00:34:35.350
Thank you.

00:34:35.392 --> 00:34:37.225
- Mr. Shanku.
- Thank you.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.392
Professor Rodriguez.

00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:42.433
You're very kind to me.

00:34:42.475 --> 00:34:43.558
Yes.

00:34:45.475 --> 00:34:47.558
I have to go.
I'll call you back.

00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:50.850
Sao Paulo welcomes you.

00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:51.975
Thank you.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.683
Thank you.

00:34:52.725 --> 00:34:53.475
So happy.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:57.433
- And I see you've met up with your old friends.
- Yes, I have.

00:34:57.558 --> 00:34:59.350
Wonderful! Wonderful!

00:34:59.558 --> 00:35:01.600
We're so deeply honoured
to have you here.

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.517
This is my secretary, NC Biswas.

00:35:04.558 --> 00:35:05.225
Ah!

00:35:05.933 --> 00:35:07.808
- Hello.
- Pleasure... Pleasure.

00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:10.808
And has Professor Shanku
received his itinerary?

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.767
It's in his room, yes.

00:35:11.808 --> 00:35:13.267
Wonderful. Alright and...

00:35:13.308 --> 00:35:15.683
All of your research materials
have arrived safely.

00:35:15.725 --> 00:35:19.225
And we've set up and organised the exhibition
according to your instructions.

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:20.517
- That's excellent.
- Great!

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.142
So, I hope you'll be happy with it.

00:35:22.183 --> 00:35:23.892
Yes, I'm sure I will.

00:35:23.933 --> 00:35:24.683
Alright then.

00:35:24.725 --> 00:35:27.725
I should let you get a bit of rest
after this long journey.

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:30.308
Jetlag doesn't affect Shanku.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.350
It doesn't?

00:35:31.392 --> 00:35:32.933
Absolutely not.

00:35:32.975 --> 00:35:36.600
Didn't you read about the Nervigour
in the "Cosmos" article?

00:35:36.642 --> 00:35:39.558
But, of course, your nerve invigorating pill.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.433
Right?

00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:51.392
This is the place I saw where...

00:35:51.933 --> 00:35:52.600
Where?

00:35:52.725 --> 00:35:55.267
Where the foreigner is going to sit with you.

00:36:17.017 --> 00:36:18.350
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

00:36:19.225 --> 00:36:19.808
Sir.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.850
The conference will be inaugrated
with the seminar...

00:36:23.892 --> 00:36:26.392
involving the three of you today at five p.m.

00:36:26.558 --> 00:36:27.058
Oh!

00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:29.350
- Your itinerary.
- Hmm.

00:36:30.892 --> 00:36:32.100
Excuse me.

00:36:39.642 --> 00:36:40.933
Wonderful.

00:36:44.142 --> 00:36:45.683
We're right beside you.

00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:48.392
I'm in 3421 and Wil is in...

00:36:48.433 --> 00:36:49.850
3423.

00:36:49.933 --> 00:36:51.100
Two, one... Two, three...

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.725
Will you be requiring anything else, sir?

00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:56.850
No, I don't think so.
Not at the moment.

00:36:57.058 --> 00:36:59.475
After the conference is over though...

00:36:59.558 --> 00:37:02.308
I think we'd all like a tour of the rainforest.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.475
Good idea!

00:37:03.642 --> 00:37:04.433
Of course.

00:37:18.558 --> 00:37:19.600
Okay...

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.142
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:37:22.392 --> 00:37:24.808
our discussion must end here for tonight.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.850
The next event will take place
in the adjacent room.

00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:32.725
And it'll be an exhibition of a select few...

00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:34.933
of the world famous Indian scientist

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.892
Trilokeshwar Shanku's most amazing inventions.

00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:41.642
Alongwith their supporting research papers.

00:37:41.808 --> 00:37:47.183
And for this the Ratantan Institute
is forever grateful to him.

00:37:47.267 --> 00:37:52.350
Not only is Prof. Shanku here to take part
in these talks and discussions...

00:37:52.433 --> 00:37:54.808
He is also our chief guest.

00:37:55.142 --> 00:37:58.392
This is because on the final day of our conference...

00:37:58.433 --> 00:38:01.225
we'll present a doctorate to him.

00:38:05.975 --> 00:38:09.850
And it's Prof. Shanku's wish
that today's exhibition...

00:38:10.142 --> 00:38:13.017
be inaugarated by his two closest friends.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.308
Yes.

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:16.933
We're deeply touched, Shanku.

00:38:16.975 --> 00:38:18.517
Indeed, we are.

00:38:18.558 --> 00:38:19.975
After you... Come.

00:38:21.017 --> 00:38:23.683
<i>Professor Trilokeshwar Shanku
was born in Giridih…
</i>

00:38:23.725 --> 00:38:24.600
This way.

00:38:24.683 --> 00:38:29.517
<i>...a border town of the state of Jharkhand, India
in the year 1945.
</i>

00:38:29.558 --> 00:38:32.558
(narration in Portuguese)

00:38:34.392 --> 00:38:38.850
It's been a while since I have seen
anyone write in shorthand.

00:38:38.892 --> 00:38:40.767
Oh, my secretary, Biswas.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.683
He's been learning Pitman.

00:38:44.933 --> 00:38:46.600
You know something...

00:38:46.642 --> 00:38:50.642
All these documents and blueprints
have been lying locked up...

00:38:50.683 --> 00:38:54.225
in my cabinets in Giridih
all this time away from prying eyes.

00:38:54.267 --> 00:38:57.975
Suddenly, to see them exhibited
for the public...

00:38:58.017 --> 00:39:01.350
here in Brazil is...

00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:07.058
<i>But what Professor Shanku is famous worldwide
for is as an inventor.
</i>

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.600
<i>He has been recognised as the greatest inventor
since Thomas Alva Edison…
</i>

00:39:10.642 --> 00:39:13.225
<i>by scientists from five continents.
</i>

00:39:13.433 --> 00:39:15.017
<i>Shanku is single.
</i>

00:39:15.058 --> 00:39:18.225
<i>His family includes his beloved cat, Newton…
</i>

00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:21.058
<i>and his faithful manservant, Prahlad.
</i>

00:39:26.433 --> 00:39:29.808
The two of us were initially
having second thoughts

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:34.392
about whether bringing
all your precious research papers here...

00:39:34.433 --> 00:39:37.517
so far from home was a wise decision.

00:39:37.558 --> 00:39:40.475
But after seeing the level of security...

00:39:40.558 --> 00:39:44.975
that was levied for the safekeeping...
made me much more at ease.

00:39:44.975 --> 00:39:45.892
Me too.

00:39:45.933 --> 00:39:48.142
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.

00:39:48.183 --> 00:39:51.392
You know they produce very good coffee
in this country.

00:39:51.433 --> 00:39:52.683
Yes!

00:39:52.725 --> 00:39:53.892
I can see that.

00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:57.767
I definitely want to take some back
when I go back home.

00:39:58.058 --> 00:39:59.600
Good morning!

00:39:59.642 --> 00:40:00.433
Good morning!

00:40:00.475 --> 00:40:03.142
- Professor T. Shanku?
- Yes.

00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:05.975
- Solomon Bloomgarten.
- Hello.

00:40:06.058 --> 00:40:07.475
Nice to meet you.

00:40:07.767 --> 00:40:10.433
Can we have a talk in private?

00:40:10.767 --> 00:40:12.183
A talk?

00:40:12.558 --> 00:40:13.475
About what?

00:40:13.558 --> 00:40:15.100
I won't take up too much of your time.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.308
Maybe, we can sit at my table.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:18.850
Alright.

00:40:19.892 --> 00:40:21.142
Excuse me.

00:40:21.558 --> 00:40:23.225
Excuse us, gentlemen.

00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:33.808
Have a seat.

00:40:36.308 --> 00:40:40.100
So, Mr. Garden...

00:40:40.308 --> 00:40:41.808
Bloom... Bloomgarten.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.975
- Mr. Bloomgarten.
- Call me Sol.

00:40:44.017 --> 00:40:46.558
And I'll call you Shank
if you don't mind.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.808
- You'll call me Shank?
- Shank.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.183
Alright, Sol. Let's talk.

00:40:53.767 --> 00:40:56.850
After reading your article
in the "Cosmos" magazine...

00:40:56.892 --> 00:40:59.975
I've had this desire
to meet with you in person.

00:41:00.017 --> 00:41:01.600
When I heard that you're coming here...

00:41:01.642 --> 00:41:03.975
I couldn't contain myself anymore.

00:41:04.308 --> 00:41:08.975
First thing I did on arriving
was to go and see your exhibition.

00:41:09.058 --> 00:41:10.308
Impressive!

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.600
- Very impressive!
- Thank you.

00:41:12.808 --> 00:41:15.225
- But I have some questions.
- Go ahead.

00:41:15.558 --> 00:41:20.642
<i>Can your Annihilin pistol really wipe
every living thing out of existence?</i>

00:41:20.683 --> 00:41:21.683
<i>It can.</i>

00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:22.725
<i>Oh!</i>

00:41:22.767 --> 00:41:26.517
<i>And your Omniscope glasses,
can they function as a microscope?</i>

00:41:26.558 --> 00:41:30.308
<i>- A telescope...and
- X-ray device...yes it can.</i>

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.100
<i>X-ray device...brilliant.</i>

00:41:32.308 --> 00:41:37.517
And your Miracurall pill?
Can it cure any and all diseases?

00:41:37.558 --> 00:41:43.017
Well, a couple of pills a day can cure
any disease in two days.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.475
Amongst all the diseases,
can it cure cancer too?

00:41:47.558 --> 00:41:50.558
It depends on the stage the cancer is at.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.850
What about the Miracurall ointment?

00:41:53.892 --> 00:42:00.183
It can be used to cure snake bites,
injuries, scratches...

00:42:00.225 --> 00:42:02.975
you know that kind of thing.

00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:17.683
This is the result of a minor car accident I had
about two months ago.

00:42:18.058 --> 00:42:19.725
And it still bothers me.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.183
There's a burning pain.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.267
Is that the famous ointment?

00:42:25.642 --> 00:42:32.017
Well, I like to carry some of my inventions
with me all the time.

00:42:56.142 --> 00:42:58.808
Holy smoke! This is amazing!

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.683
Now I know everything I need to know.

00:43:01.725 --> 00:43:08.558
Shank, I'm willing to buy the patents
of all four of your inventions immediately.

00:43:08.808 --> 00:43:13.683
And I'm willing to pay you
one million dollars for them.

00:43:36.183 --> 00:43:41.350
- Sorry, Sol. Not interested.
- Wait, Shank... Please sit...

00:43:42.558 --> 00:43:46.975
What are you getting from keeping
all this incredible inventions so secret?

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.767
Why are you being so selfish?

00:43:48.808 --> 00:43:51.433
Are you really interested in...

00:43:51.475 --> 00:43:55.183
Are you really interested
in the public welfare?

00:43:55.225 --> 00:43:58.808
Your interest is in the commercial side
of things...

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:02.600
and how you can use my inventions in those.
Isn't it?

00:44:02.683 --> 00:44:04.850
Shank, I'm a businessman.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.975
So I'll look at anything
from a business perspective.

00:44:08.017 --> 00:44:10.100
What's so surprising about that?

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.975
But I am not going to leave you hanging.

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:15.558
I have a cheque book with me right now.

00:44:15.683 --> 00:44:18.308
Or if you prefer cash,
that can be managed.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.267
Let me tell you something, Sol.

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:24.892
None of my inventions,
especially the four you mentioned...

00:44:25.183 --> 00:44:27.933
can be manufactured in a factory
using machines.

00:44:27.975 --> 00:44:29.517
Do you understand that?

00:44:30.017 --> 00:44:32.058
I don't believe you.

00:44:32.308 --> 00:44:34.975
Then there's nothing I can do about that.

00:44:35.017 --> 00:44:36.933
Shank, I'll double my price.

00:44:37.558 --> 00:44:40.558
Sol, Sol, Sol...

00:44:40.558 --> 00:44:46.142
Even if you offered me 20 million instead of one
my answer would still be the same.

00:44:46.142 --> 00:44:47.433
- Shank!
- Tilu...

00:44:47.767 --> 00:44:50.517
- Tilu, you are in...
- What's the matter, Nakur?

00:44:55.683 --> 00:45:00.725
El... El Dorado...

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:04.433
El Dorado.

00:45:07.017 --> 00:45:08.558
Who was that man?

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.142
My secretary.

00:45:10.933 --> 00:45:14.975
Why did he all of a sudden bring up
El Dorado of all things?

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.225
He's done a lot of research on South America,
you see.

00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:22.850
So, the fact that he should know
about El Dorado is not surprising.

00:45:23.308 --> 00:45:27.142
My ancestors as well as I
on two different occasions in my youth...

00:45:27.183 --> 00:45:29.517
have come here to look for El Dorado.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:34.600
I didn't leave one single country
out of the search, you know.

00:45:34.642 --> 00:45:37.475
Finally, I contracted a severe disease...

00:45:37.558 --> 00:45:40.683
and I had to quit the search
for my beloved golden city.

00:45:40.683 --> 00:45:42.975
And went home soon after.

00:45:43.892 --> 00:45:45.725
Coming to Brazil after so long...

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:49.892
I was frequently reminded
of El Dorado yesterday.

00:45:50.767 --> 00:45:51.433
And today.

00:45:51.475 --> 00:45:55.350
Look Sol, nowadays, everybody knows
that El Dorado is a myth.

00:45:55.392 --> 00:45:58.225
- So, there's absolutely no point--
- No, Shank.

00:45:58.267 --> 00:46:01.683
I still believe El Dorado exists.

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:07.017
Anyway, I'm staying in this hotel in room 4422.

00:46:07.058 --> 00:46:09.767
If you change your mind,
please let me know.

00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:14.267
I don't see that happening,
Mr. Bloomgarten.

00:46:16.558 --> 00:46:18.183
The nerve of him!

00:46:18.225 --> 00:46:20.975
That rascal wants to buy patents
from you?

00:46:21.017 --> 00:46:24.517
We also saw that you gave him
some demonstration.

00:46:24.558 --> 00:46:25.600
What can I say?

00:46:25.642 --> 00:46:30.267
We, scientists, can never resist the temptation
of showing off once in a while.

00:46:30.308 --> 00:46:33.225
No, Shanku. You're too soft.

00:46:33.267 --> 00:46:36.058
Which is why you have to deal with people
like him.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.100
If he bothers you again, let us know.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.808
We'll put him in his place.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:42.517
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:12.225 --> 00:48:15.600
I've finalised the tour of the rainforest
for you, sir.

00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:17.350
- Really?
- Yes.

00:48:17.392 --> 00:48:19.558
The day after tomorrow
after breakfast...

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.433
we'll be flying out north to Brasilia,
the capital of Brazil.

00:48:24.558 --> 00:48:28.433
From there we're going to take a small plane
to a city called Posto Diauarum.

00:48:28.433 --> 00:48:31.558
Located just north of the Xingu national forest.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.933
The remainder of the journey will be by boat.

00:48:34.017 --> 00:48:37.350
In Brasilia, we're going to be meeting up
a guide called Hyter.

00:48:37.392 --> 00:48:40.308
He's quite a unique fellow.

00:48:40.558 --> 00:48:43.683
We locally refer to him as a "sertanista"...

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.017
Sa-sa-satanista?

00:48:46.058 --> 00:48:49.183
The word literally means forest specialist.

00:48:49.975 --> 00:48:53.142
He has already been informed
about our arrival.

00:48:53.183 --> 00:48:56.600
He'll give us more details of our trip
as soon as we arrive.

00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:58.142
So you'll be coming with us?

00:48:58.183 --> 00:48:59.350
How can I not?

00:48:59.392 --> 00:49:01.600
Professor Rodriguez insisted.

00:49:02.142 --> 00:49:06.142
Only when you're on a plane back home
will my task be complete.

00:50:25.183 --> 00:50:26.058
What's the matter?

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.142
Please don't be offended,
but I couldn't stop myself.

00:50:29.183 --> 00:50:30.892
When did this happen?

00:50:30.933 --> 00:50:32.725
I fell down in a hurry.

00:50:32.767 --> 00:50:34.683
Some water please.

00:50:37.058 --> 00:50:40.892
The deed has been done.

00:50:40.933 --> 00:50:41.808
What?

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:44.183
It's been done.

00:50:44.225 --> 00:50:47.808
What are you talking about?

00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:51.767
The research papers of your inventions...

00:50:51.892 --> 00:50:54.767
The formulae of my inventions?

00:50:55.892 --> 00:50:59.058
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:51:00.683 --> 00:51:02.558
Did you dream about it?

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.475
It wasn't a dream!

00:51:04.808 --> 00:51:07.100
The security guards were bribed...

00:51:07.142 --> 00:51:09.475
He entered the exhibition...

00:51:09.642 --> 00:51:12.308
- He has copied...
- He?

00:51:12.892 --> 00:51:15.267
Who is he, Nakur?

00:51:27.142 --> 00:51:28.517
Lobo?

00:51:28.558 --> 00:51:30.892
Our very own.

00:51:31.267 --> 00:51:39.725
Actually, I couldn't put my thoughts together
in a new place.

00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:42.850
That's why Lobo...

00:51:44.433 --> 00:51:48.267
Wait... I'll get something for you.

00:51:56.267 --> 00:52:00.683
After you get back to your room,
put this ointment on your forehead.

00:52:01.558 --> 00:52:06.100
And take this pill now.

00:52:06.308 --> 00:52:07.725
What is this?

00:52:08.183 --> 00:52:10.017
Cerebrillant pill.

00:52:10.058 --> 00:52:14.850
This will keep your head clear
and your emotions too.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.975
But don't be scared.

00:52:27.058 --> 00:52:33.683
I'll try my best so that no harm comes to you.

00:52:35.225 --> 00:52:43.225
Is it possible for Lobo
to do this on his own?

00:52:43.392 --> 00:52:45.475
I'm sure someone is behind this.

00:52:45.558 --> 00:52:47.767
Of course.

00:52:48.225 --> 00:52:50.808
A very rich man.

00:54:53.475 --> 00:54:55.225
Very well done.

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:00.808
Thank you.

00:55:07.308 --> 00:55:10.725
One sip is all you need to take, right?

00:55:14.475 --> 00:55:15.225
So...

00:55:15.475 --> 00:55:17.017
To Dr. Shanku!

00:55:17.058 --> 00:55:19.600
- Doctor Shanku!
- Doctor Shanku!

00:55:26.558 --> 00:55:28.433
Good evening!

00:55:30.683 --> 00:55:34.100
- Good evening.
- Solomon Bloomgarten. And you are?

00:55:34.225 --> 00:55:35.808
NC Biswas--

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.808
- You're Prof. Shanku's secretary.
- Yes.

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:44.850
Well Bis, the other day, I heard
you mention El Dorado.

00:55:44.892 --> 00:55:47.100
What do you know about the city?

00:55:47.267 --> 00:55:49.475
I'm not very educated.

00:55:49.642 --> 00:55:51.308
Very ordinary man.

00:55:51.975 --> 00:55:57.850
Yesterday, reading a Bengali book
on El Dorado.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.350
Reading... Reading...

00:56:01.308 --> 00:56:03.433
Then seeing the city.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.975
In front of my eyes.

00:56:06.058 --> 00:56:07.058
That is why...

00:56:07.058 --> 00:56:08.350
Seeing the city?

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.892
El Dorado?

00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:16.100
What a day!

00:56:16.142 --> 00:56:18.392
But tell me where is your secretary?

00:56:18.433 --> 00:56:22.475
He was somewhere inside
the last time I saw him.

00:56:24.225 --> 00:56:27.308
You mean me, here, before, I?

00:56:27.433 --> 00:56:30.517
No, no, no...

00:56:30.808 --> 00:56:32.808
No...

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.808
- I was just talking to them...
- Come on... Scram.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:39.308
Hi, congratulations!

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:42.017
Please, sit. Please.

00:56:45.975 --> 00:56:49.100
Who is this secretary that you've brought?

00:56:49.267 --> 00:56:50.058
Why?

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.142
This gentleman has got several talents.

00:56:52.183 --> 00:56:55.725
He looked me in the eye
and told me everything about myself.

00:56:56.017 --> 00:56:58.850
And I've told him I'll hand him over
to Myron.

00:56:58.892 --> 00:57:00.975
He'll be rolling in riches overnight.

00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:05.017
Your man will be owning a Tesla
in three months time.

00:57:05.558 --> 00:57:06.808
Who's Myron?

00:57:07.017 --> 00:57:09.808
Holy smoke!
You haven't heard of Myron?

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:13.558
Myron Enterprises. He's the best promoter
and manager there is.

00:57:13.808 --> 00:57:20.683
His team of managers have established the careers
of musicians, dancers, singers, even magicians.

00:57:21.225 --> 00:57:23.558
And he's already an exceptional man.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.600
But most importantly,
he knows where El Dorado is!

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.100
What, sir?

00:57:31.725 --> 00:57:33.392
Go on, Bis.
Tell them.

00:57:33.433 --> 00:57:37.933
Have you told them that
you know where El Dorado is?

00:57:37.975 --> 00:57:41.975
I've told them what I know.

00:57:43.725 --> 00:57:46.017
Go, tell them man.

00:57:49.183 --> 00:57:51.475
El Dorado is in Brazil.

00:57:51.683 --> 00:57:53.600
Definite.

00:57:54.392 --> 00:57:56.892
Inside very deep jungle...

00:57:57.267 --> 00:57:58.683
Only I know...

00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:01.100
Nobody knows.

00:58:01.433 --> 00:58:03.183
Nobody stays.

00:58:03.767 --> 00:58:05.392
Empty city.

00:58:06.183 --> 00:58:07.683
But...

00:58:08.558 --> 00:58:10.225
when Sun falls...

00:58:13.767 --> 00:58:17.142
the city shines...

00:58:17.808 --> 00:58:20.475
Golden gate...

00:58:21.017 --> 00:58:22.517
Golden pillar...

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.642
Golden pyramid...

00:58:24.933 --> 00:58:29.725
Door, window... All gold.

00:58:30.475 --> 00:58:31.850
Then...

00:58:31.892 --> 00:58:35.892
One time, 1000 years ago...

00:58:36.558 --> 00:58:39.225
Heavy rain... very heavy...

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.850
Then...

00:58:43.975 --> 00:58:47.475
deadly insects...
invade the jungle.

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.308
resulting in a cholera epidemic.

00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.975
All people dead.

00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:04.142
Believe me, Tilu, I saw everything play
in front of my eyes just like a movie.

00:59:04.642 --> 00:59:07.392
Well! That's it then.

00:59:07.433 --> 00:59:11.850
What remains now is for you to organise
an expedition to the Amazon.

00:59:11.892 --> 00:59:15.225
For now we're very tired
and would like to leave.

00:59:15.308 --> 00:59:16.850
Nakur...

00:59:18.433 --> 00:59:21.183
Look, I'm telling you for your own good.

00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:25.392
Please don't reveal your abilities
in front of random people.

00:59:25.558 --> 00:59:27.350
What do you think?

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:31.683
Do you want to become a stage performer?

00:59:31.975 --> 00:59:36.642
You're inexperienced
and you still don't know people.

00:59:36.683 --> 00:59:40.933
But if you get stuck with Solomon
you'll be in great danger.

00:59:41.058 --> 00:59:47.100
This is my request. Please don't jump
into things without speaking to me.

00:59:47.725 --> 00:59:49.433
Please forgive me.

00:59:50.308 --> 00:59:52.308
I've made a big mistake.

00:59:53.058 --> 00:59:55.392
This is my first time in a foreign country.

00:59:55.767 --> 00:59:57.600
I'm from a small town.

00:59:57.892 --> 01:00:00.433
That's why I lost my mind.

01:00:01.725 --> 01:00:05.100
You've done me a great favour
by warning me.

01:00:05.475 --> 01:00:07.767
Okay, I'll take your leave.

01:00:10.683 --> 01:00:14.183
We're leaving at 8 a.m.
Hope you remember.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.475
Of course, yes.
I'll be at the lobby.

01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:24.725
Did you understand anything?

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.517
Understood... A little.

01:00:28.975 --> 01:00:34.225
Well, if El Dorado really exists...

01:00:35.392 --> 01:00:37.517
Why don't we try to find it?

01:00:38.808 --> 01:00:40.183
Incredible!

01:00:40.642 --> 01:00:44.683
Even after its existence has clearly been proven
to be a myth.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:50.808
Are you telling me that Biswas' words
have turned you into a believer?

01:00:53.308 --> 01:00:54.725
But leaving all this...

01:00:54.767 --> 01:00:58.267
If that rascal Solomon
wants to travel through the forest...

01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:04.058
and become dinner to a tribe of cannibals,
I have no problem with that whatsoever.

01:01:04.142 --> 01:01:07.642
But I'm not getting involved in all this.

01:01:08.017 --> 01:01:10.017
I agree completely with that.

01:01:10.142 --> 01:01:11.350
Let's stick to the plan.

01:01:11.392 --> 01:01:13.725
Oh, thank heavens!

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.892
I'm so disappointed with you.

01:01:17.725 --> 01:01:18.808
With me?

01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:20.308
Why?

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:24.558
Because you seem not to realise
the potential of your ally...

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.183
Your secretary's eyes can see
beyond the mundane.

01:01:29.225 --> 01:01:33.142
Ten minutes ago when he was telling us
about his vision of El Dorado...

01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:38.975
I got so enraptured
that I couldn't take my eyes off him.

01:01:40.308 --> 01:01:41.600
<i>Good morning!
(in Portuguese)</i>

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:43.600
Morning!

01:01:43.975 --> 01:01:44.725
Good morning!

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:48.558
I trust you're aware that Mr. Biswas
checked out earlier this morning and left.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.350
Right?

01:01:49.392 --> 01:01:51.475
What did you just say?

01:01:51.558 --> 01:01:55.808
Due to some apparently urgent work,
he had to leave the city for three days.

01:01:55.808 --> 01:01:58.850
And this is for you.

01:01:59.892 --> 01:02:01.100
Excuse me.

01:02:01.433 --> 01:02:04.517
All check out formalities are done with.
I'll get the car.

01:02:04.558 --> 01:02:06.350
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.392
<i>Dear Tilu.</i>

01:02:09.433 --> 01:02:11.767
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

01:02:11.808 --> 01:02:16.017
<i>Couldn't control my urge
to get 20000 dollars.</i>

01:02:16.225 --> 01:02:19.767
<i>We are leaving
on the gentleman's private plane.</i>

01:02:19.892 --> 01:02:25.350
<i>Our destination is a forest area
350 miles north-west of Sao Paolo.</i>

01:02:25.892 --> 01:02:29.350
<i>That's where El Dorado is located.</i>

01:02:29.392 --> 01:02:35.225
<i>The foreigner will not be able to reach
the golden city without my help.</i>

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.225
<i>I have been forced to give him the directions.</i>

01:02:40.392 --> 01:02:44.100
<i>I'll join you once my work here is done.</i>

01:02:44.475 --> 01:02:46.933
<i>I am aware your route.</i>

01:02:46.975 --> 01:02:49.517
<i>May God bless you.</i>

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:54.267
<i>Yours faithfully,
Nakur Chandra Biswas.</i>

01:02:54.808 --> 01:02:56.183
<i>Post script.</i>

01:02:56.225 --> 01:02:59.725
<i>Thanks a lot of the Miracurall ointment.</i>

01:03:11.392 --> 01:03:12.975
Letter from Biswas?

01:03:13.975 --> 01:03:16.350
He's fled, hasn't he?

01:03:17.142 --> 01:03:22.058
Yes, he has fled
with that Bloomgarten fellow.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.600
I know that he did it for the money.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600
He's also said that

01:03:25.642 --> 01:03:30.517
he's going to meet up with us
after dropping the foreigners at El Dorado.

01:03:30.767 --> 01:03:32.350
Amazing!

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:35.767
Does the man have no self-respect whatsoever?

01:03:35.808 --> 01:03:41.392
He dares to show his face amongst our company
even after doing something so base.

01:03:41.433 --> 01:03:44.350
Damn it! It's all my fault.

01:03:44.392 --> 01:03:47.558
I'm the one who insisted you
to bring him along with us.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.183
Dr. Shanku!

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.600
We're all set.

01:03:56.642 --> 01:04:00.142
Anyway, don't let this bother you too much.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:07.558
But from now on, we must stay away from anything
that's paranormal, unnatural and spiritual.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.267
For our own good.

01:04:14.683 --> 01:04:16.100
Lobo!

01:04:16.892 --> 01:04:19.225
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:04:19.392 --> 01:04:20.808
- Hyter.
- Hello.

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.850
- Hyter.
- Saunders.

01:04:23.683 --> 01:04:26.183
- Hyter. Nice to meet you. Kroll
- Kroll.

01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:29.892
Our plane is parked out
in another small airport.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:30.558
Right.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.392
It's a 10-minute drive from here.

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.267
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:38.433
How was Sao Paulo?

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:39.558
Very nice.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.683
We'll discuss the plans for the upcoming days
aboard the plane.

01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:48.058
If you want to see anything in particular
now is the time to tell me.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.017
Okay but what's your opinion
about El Dorado?

01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:53.975
Wow!

01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:59.475
In today's modern world,
you're still asking me about El Dorado.

01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:02.642
The place has been proven a myth
years ago.

01:05:03.017 --> 01:05:05.642
El Dorado isn't even a city.

01:05:06.058 --> 01:05:08.267
It is actually a person.

01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:14.475
The word "Dorado" can refer to both golden city
or golden person in Portuguese.

01:05:14.558 --> 01:05:15.933
Exactly!

01:05:16.017 --> 01:05:20.850
The tribal folks started worshipping
a certain individual...

01:05:20.892 --> 01:05:24.183
believing him to be the avatar of the Sun God.

01:05:24.225 --> 01:05:27.100
And giving him the name El Dorado.

01:05:41.392 --> 01:05:46.017
Our present destination is the city
of Posto Diauarum.

01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:51.058
From there we'll take a launch
down the Xingu river until we reach Porori.

01:05:51.058 --> 01:05:52.725
- Porori...
- Porori.

01:05:52.767 --> 01:05:57.850
At Porori, we'll meet the last members
of the Txukahameis tribe.

01:05:57.892 --> 01:05:59.308
- Right.
- Oh really!

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:03.475
Who until recently had lived
in their own traditional style.

01:06:03.767 --> 01:06:05.975
It's a fascinating tribe!
Fascinating!

01:06:06.017 --> 01:06:08.683
I know their language.
So communication is easy.

01:06:08.725 --> 01:06:09.517
Yeah.

01:06:10.225 --> 01:06:12.017
After leaving Porori...

01:06:12.058 --> 01:06:16.933
we'll travel a short distance downriver
and see von Martius Falls.

01:06:16.975 --> 01:06:20.100
After which we'll return to Brasilia.

01:06:20.183 --> 01:06:21.892
Oh jolly good!

01:06:53.808 --> 01:06:55.933
Look to your right!

01:07:03.183 --> 01:07:05.600
That the carcass of a cayman alligator.

01:07:05.642 --> 01:07:08.933
No matter what you do,
don't put your hands in the water.

01:07:08.975 --> 01:07:13.142
This river is rife with voracious piranhas.

01:07:35.058 --> 01:07:36.392
What was that?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.517
There's a highway under construction nearby.

01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:42.017
They are cutting sections of the forest.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.808
And using dynamite
to break apart the mountains.

01:08:01.017 --> 01:08:02.933
How much further?

01:08:03.308 --> 01:08:05.100
Soon... Soon...

01:08:18.017 --> 01:08:20.683
El Dorado!

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.767
My beautiful El Dorado!
It's breathtaking!

01:08:32.058 --> 01:08:33.475
Joe, land this thing.

01:08:33.558 --> 01:08:35.642
I can't land in such dense overgrowth.

01:08:35.683 --> 01:08:38.017
Just find a clearing somewhere.

01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:57.850
We should reach the Porori village
by dawn tomorrow.

01:08:58.017 --> 01:08:58.808
Good.

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:01.142
I know we're quite deep inside the forest...

01:09:01.183 --> 01:09:03.808
but we haven't seen one thing yet.

01:09:04.392 --> 01:09:05.433
And what's that?

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.933
Anaconda.

01:09:09.558 --> 01:09:11.933
It's best we don't run across one of those.

01:09:12.392 --> 01:09:13.767
Quite dangerous creatures.

01:09:13.808 --> 01:09:15.892
Have you ever seen one of them?

01:09:15.933 --> 01:09:17.642
Yes, twice.

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.850
We've seen them too.

01:09:20.558 --> 01:09:22.392
Well, at the zoo.

01:09:24.767 --> 01:09:26.058
Excuse me.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.183
I've read some traveller's articles...

01:09:29.225 --> 01:09:35.350
that say this kind of snake
can grow upto 50 metres maybe.

01:09:35.558 --> 01:09:37.267
Come on, Wil.

01:09:37.267 --> 01:09:41.100
Anyway, I have no regrets
that I haven't seen one of those.

01:09:41.142 --> 01:09:48.058
But you'd have to agree what we've seen
of Brazil's rainforest is just simply--

01:09:52.475 --> 01:09:54.725
It's a jaguar...

01:10:26.642 --> 01:10:27.933
What's that?

01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:30.892
I'll tell you later.
But first Lobo...

01:10:36.975 --> 01:10:40.308
It's alright, Lobo.
The danger's gone.

01:10:40.392 --> 01:10:42.933
You're safe now.
You're safe.

01:10:42.975 --> 01:10:46.975
I went behind the bushes to relieve myself.

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:52.017
I saw in front of me...

01:10:58.975 --> 01:11:00.142
What happened?

01:11:00.975 --> 01:11:02.892
Forgive me, professor.

01:11:03.642 --> 01:11:05.975
Forgive me, professor.
I've wronged you.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:08.350
How have you wronged me?

01:11:08.808 --> 01:11:10.975
I night before the presentation, I...

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.517
I bribed the security guards and...

01:11:14.308 --> 01:11:15.517
And entered the exhibition hall.

01:11:15.558 --> 01:11:19.433
And scanned my research papers...
Gave them to Solomon.

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.558
Is that right?

01:11:20.767 --> 01:11:23.017
He offered me money, professor.

01:11:23.308 --> 01:11:25.475
A huge sum of money.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:27.975
What's going to happen to me now?

01:11:28.058 --> 01:11:29.058
Okay.

01:11:29.058 --> 01:11:32.475
- Once I get back to the city...
- We can think about that later.

01:11:32.558 --> 01:11:35.392
We can think about that later.
For now, just rest.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:36.600
Just rest.

01:11:36.642 --> 01:11:37.767
Please forgive me.

01:11:38.267 --> 01:11:39.142
Yes.

01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:40.558
Go to sleep.

01:11:40.975 --> 01:11:42.558
(praying)

01:11:43.392 --> 01:11:44.558
Go to sleep.

01:11:45.767 --> 01:11:46.517
Yes.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:55.308
But how did you even know about this?

01:11:55.433 --> 01:11:57.892
Oh, you know, my secretary.

01:11:59.808 --> 01:12:03.850
And even after knowing about this,
you didn't think of telling us.

01:12:03.892 --> 01:12:05.808
Damn it, Shanku!

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:09.267
What would be the point?
There's no proof.

01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:12.100
Because your loss is incalculable.

01:12:12.142 --> 01:12:15.183
You're going to be ruined.

01:12:15.683 --> 01:12:20.225
If I could just get my hands on Solomon,
right now.

01:12:20.308 --> 01:12:24.892
I would boil him and invite
local cannibal tribes to feast on him.

01:12:24.933 --> 01:12:33.933
But if Mr. Biswas knew about Lobo's treachery
does that mean that El Dorado is also...

01:12:47.308 --> 01:12:49.100
That wasn't dynamite.

01:12:49.725 --> 01:12:52.975
Is there a volcano nearby?

01:13:07.225 --> 01:13:11.058
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.308
It smells good.

01:13:14.767 --> 01:13:16.517
Coffee?

01:13:24.558 --> 01:13:26.267
<i>Thanks.
</i>

01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:28.642
Porori is just a mile and a half.

01:14:15.475 --> 01:14:17.058
Jeremy, the wheel!

01:14:25.975 --> 01:14:29.767
The arrow was dipped in curare poison.

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:39.600
Curare poison.

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.683
Just keep calm.

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:47.183
Should I take the next bend?

01:14:47.308 --> 01:14:49.517
Yes, yes.

01:14:52.725 --> 01:14:54.225
Hyter?

01:15:06.892 --> 01:15:10.600
It seems we're out of danger for now.
Don't you think?

01:15:10.642 --> 01:15:11.892
Yes.

01:15:14.017 --> 01:15:17.392
He's got a pulse
but it's very faint.

01:15:17.433 --> 01:15:21.350
Curare is a very potent poison.
It'll take him some time to...

01:15:21.933 --> 01:15:26.142
In that case, let's get some distance
between us and the tribals.

01:15:26.183 --> 01:15:28.058
And stop the boat.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.142
There's no point in going
forward without Hyter.

01:15:55.558 --> 01:15:56.975
Professor...

01:15:59.308 --> 01:16:02.017
Did you have any idea
that you're travelling with...

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:06.642
one of the world's most celebrated
and genius inventors?

01:16:06.683 --> 01:16:09.433
I suspected something like that yesterday.

01:16:10.058 --> 01:16:10.892
And today...

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:12.017
But tell me...

01:16:12.058 --> 01:16:16.558
What could have caused the Txukahameis tribe
to be so riled up?

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.975
I think this might be related to the explosion
we heard last evening.

01:16:20.017 --> 01:16:24.475
They still believe these large scale
natural disasters to be acts of God...

01:16:24.808 --> 01:16:26.850
showing his divine displeasure.

01:16:26.892 --> 01:16:28.933
And they start panicking.

01:16:45.058 --> 01:16:48.225
Shanku! Shanku!

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.017
That's not going to work, Tilu.

01:17:12.433 --> 01:17:15.433
Hey, are you happy now?

01:17:15.475 --> 01:17:17.975
This is incredible!

01:17:20.308 --> 01:17:21.642
Thank you.

01:17:23.642 --> 01:17:28.350
Tell me, Tilu.
Has my ability improved?

01:17:28.975 --> 01:17:33.183
Did you find the image blurry or unclear?

01:17:33.642 --> 01:17:36.100
Close to real life, isn't it?

01:17:36.808 --> 01:17:39.017
All thanks to you.

01:17:39.225 --> 01:17:42.100
I wouldn't be able to do it
if it wasn't for you.

01:17:42.142 --> 01:17:43.225
What do you mean?

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:44.642
Your medicine.

01:17:44.725 --> 01:17:47.058
All thanks to Cerebrillant!

01:17:48.058 --> 01:17:55.808
Your pill has made be doubly capable.

01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:58.058
- Really?
- Yes.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.975
Let me introduce you.
Joe, come.

01:18:02.767 --> 01:18:05.058
This is pilot, Joe Hopgood.

01:18:05.433 --> 01:18:08.433
He brought me here in Solomon's plane.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:12.142
We had to use the small boat
for the last few miles.

01:18:12.642 --> 01:18:14.850
Nice to meet you Mr. Hopgood.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.350
And El Dorado?

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:19.892
I made him see it from the plane.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.642
The way I showed you the snake.
Exactly like that.

01:18:25.683 --> 01:18:28.142
Wait. Here.

01:18:28.183 --> 01:18:29.183
SOUTH AMERICAN EXPEDITION
BRAZIL

01:18:29.225 --> 01:18:31.892
This is the book on Brazil.

01:18:32.933 --> 01:18:34.683
Look at this.

01:18:35.808 --> 01:18:38.433
This is the photo of the snake.

01:18:38.808 --> 01:18:40.808
And see this.

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:44.975
This is a fictional drawing of El Dorado.

01:18:45.558 --> 01:18:48.183
Where will I find a photo?

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.558
This looks very amateurish.

01:18:51.725 --> 01:18:55.475
Of course, it is.

01:18:55.725 --> 01:18:59.058
And this is what you showed Solomon?

01:18:59.308 --> 01:19:01.433
He was elated!

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:02.642
Then what happened?

01:19:02.683 --> 01:19:08.100
First let me tell you what happened
on the last day of the conference.

01:19:08.142 --> 01:19:09.600
Last day?
What happened?

01:19:09.642 --> 01:19:10.933
You already know.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.267
Whatever is going to happen...

01:19:13.308 --> 01:19:15.017
if we already know about it...

01:19:15.058 --> 01:19:16.600
it can be of a great advantage.

01:19:16.725 --> 01:19:17.850
That's what happened to me too.

01:19:19.975 --> 01:19:21.600
To Dr. Shanku!

01:19:21.767 --> 01:19:24.142
Doctor Shanku!

01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:44.892
(singing in foreign language)

01:19:59.975 --> 01:20:05.767
Just say we actually end up finding El Dorado
with Bis' help. What then?

01:20:06.392 --> 01:20:08.392
I'll make him my ace in the hole.

01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:11.017
And take him back to the United States.

01:20:11.267 --> 01:20:16.433
Not exploiting his remarkable talents
would be a huge mistake.

01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:20.392
But I don't trust our pilot, Joe.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.100
Once he finds out the location of El Dorado.

01:20:23.142 --> 01:20:27.142
What guarantee do we have
that he's not going to backstab us?

01:20:27.308 --> 01:20:30.308
No, he must be taken care of.

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:34.558
The credit of finding El Dorado should be mine.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.017
I, Solomon Bloomgarten and no one else.

01:20:43.392 --> 01:20:46.017
Fine, I'll handle Joe after we get back here.

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:48.475
Make it look like an accident.
An accident.

01:20:48.767 --> 01:20:49.933
Absolutely!

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:52.558
And what about Professor Shanku's inventions?

01:20:52.725 --> 01:20:55.975
We'll take care of that when we return.
We have the goods.

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:57.433
Why worry?

01:20:57.683 --> 01:21:01.850
Now my priority is El Dorado.

01:21:01.892 --> 01:21:04.642
<i>What a dangerous man!</i>

01:21:05.142 --> 01:21:12.642
<i>That's when I decided
I had to tell him about El Dorado!</i>

01:21:12.808 --> 01:21:15.933
<i>Otherwise, the next part of my vision
won't take place.</i>

01:21:16.058 --> 01:21:19.517
<i>Although, it didn't take much effort to find him.</i>

01:21:37.933 --> 01:21:41.183
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:21:41.225 --> 01:21:42.933
Solomon Bloomgarten.
And you are?

01:21:42.975 --> 01:21:47.017
<i>I told Sol everything about himself.</i>

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:50.392
<i>And I told him about El Dorado.</i>

01:21:50.683 --> 01:21:53.017
<i>Sol was very happy.</i>

01:21:53.058 --> 01:21:56.183
<i>The next day's plans were charted out.</i>

01:21:56.225 --> 01:21:58.600
<i>And you already know
what happened after that.</i>

01:21:59.725 --> 01:22:02.933
I was just speaking to them.

01:22:02.975 --> 01:22:05.017
Hi, congratulations!

01:22:05.308 --> 01:22:07.183
Please, sit. Please.

01:22:07.392 --> 01:22:12.142
Now let me tell you what happened
after I showed him El Dorado.

01:22:12.267 --> 01:22:15.017
The city is hidden in dense forest.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.975
How will the plane land there?

01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:19.975
We landed it.

01:22:20.058 --> 01:22:24.475
<i>In a relatively empty area.</i>

01:22:29.017 --> 01:22:32.558
Bis, I was forgetting something.

01:22:33.642 --> 01:22:35.225
There you are.

01:22:36.725 --> 01:22:38.475
As promised.

01:22:39.933 --> 01:22:42.183
Bis, Joe come.

01:23:19.308 --> 01:23:20.058
Come.

01:23:23.975 --> 01:23:24.600
Come...

01:23:24.892 --> 01:23:26.350
We don't have time. Come...

01:23:31.933 --> 01:23:33.433
This was on the plane.

01:23:33.725 --> 01:23:35.475
In Solomon's luggage.

01:23:36.058 --> 01:23:38.767
All the scanned copies of the formulae is here.

01:23:39.225 --> 01:23:40.975
It's still here.

01:23:42.933 --> 01:23:47.850
But what will happen when Solomon finds
that El Dorado doesn't exist.

01:23:48.267 --> 01:23:49.267
Solomon?

01:23:49.683 --> 01:23:50.933
Where is Solomon?

01:23:51.058 --> 01:23:53.350
He is not there in this world anymore.

01:23:54.308 --> 01:23:57.642
When we entered the forest
it was 5:30 p.m.

01:23:58.308 --> 01:24:01.100
And when we fled them...

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:02.892
<i>it was quarter to six.</i>

01:24:05.558 --> 01:24:06.558
Stop!

01:24:07.392 --> 01:24:09.017
Where did they go?

01:24:10.975 --> 01:24:13.600
Bis! Joe!

01:24:15.392 --> 01:24:16.308
Go find them.

01:24:16.392 --> 01:24:18.683
Maybe they've fallen behind.

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:29.683
That double crossing...

01:24:31.725 --> 01:24:33.725
What the... Meteorite!

01:24:33.725 --> 01:24:35.183
Run!

01:24:45.933 --> 01:24:48.850
Yesterday's explosion.

01:24:49.267 --> 01:24:54.100
I already knew about this incident
because of you.

01:24:54.808 --> 01:24:57.058
A man like you...

01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:00.267
I'm honoured to be in your company.

01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:03.642
How can I let go of your enemy so easily?

01:25:15.017 --> 01:25:19.142
- How long back to Brasilia, Joe?
- A couple of hours.

01:25:19.308 --> 01:25:23.892
- Lovely weather. It must be nice to fly here.
- Yes.

01:25:24.017 --> 01:25:26.100
- See you on the plane.
- Alright.

01:25:26.142 --> 01:25:27.767
Sorry, Lobo.

01:25:27.808 --> 01:25:30.308
If there was room on the plane
I would have taken you.

01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:32.725
- But...
- No problem.

01:25:32.767 --> 01:25:36.017
I'll put him on a plane to Sao Paulo
once we get back to Brasilia.

01:25:36.058 --> 01:25:36.725
Thank you.

01:25:36.767 --> 01:25:38.183
Hey, guys!

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.475
We're ready to leave.

01:25:41.183 --> 01:25:45.642
But... But...
What's going to happen to me now?

01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:49.308
Since all my research has been recovered
safe and sound...

01:25:49.558 --> 01:25:54.933
I don't think we'll need
to lodge a complaint against you.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.100
I've taken many a group
on a tour of the forest before.

01:25:59.142 --> 01:26:02.142
But I'll never forget this trip
with you folks ever.

01:26:02.267 --> 01:26:05.475
And professor...
I owe you my life.

01:26:05.975 --> 01:26:07.558
<i>My pleasure.</i>

01:26:07.767 --> 01:26:09.058
Joe!

01:26:09.142 --> 01:26:12.142
<i>I couldn't show them the falls...
(in Portuguese)</i>

01:26:12.183 --> 01:26:14.517
<i>Could you take a detour and...</i>

01:26:30.725 --> 01:26:32.725
So, that's it.
It's done then.

01:26:32.767 --> 01:26:35.433
We've seen everything we set out to see.

01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:37.100
Everything but one thing.

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.558
And what's that?

01:26:38.642 --> 01:26:40.350
As he is already with us...

01:26:40.433 --> 01:26:44.350
I wonder if we could see El Dorado
through his eyes.

01:26:44.392 --> 01:26:48.600
- Bad drawing. Very bad.
- Come on. Even so...

01:26:48.892 --> 01:26:53.017
Then why see El Dorado through Biswas' eyes?

01:26:53.058 --> 01:26:55.433
You can see it through my eyes.

01:26:55.475 --> 01:26:57.183
Through your eyes?

01:26:57.225 --> 01:26:58.850
What do you mean?

01:26:58.892 --> 01:27:03.308
Don't forget that the medicine I gave Biswas
that night was my invention.

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:05.517
Cerebrillant.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.683
Unbelievable!
