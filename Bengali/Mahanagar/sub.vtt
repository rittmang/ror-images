WEBVTT

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.000
Pintu!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560
Is that Bhombol?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.960
Baba?
- Did you call him? - Who?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.240
I told you a former student of
mine is now an eye specialist.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.080
You think you'll get free glasses...

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.440
just because he was your pupil?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.520
Well,
he might take it into consideration.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.240
I told you, Baba.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.160
I'll get you glasses as soon
as things improve a bit.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.800
And what do you want?
- Bus ticket.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880
Ticket?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.480
Here. One yellow, one black.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.640
Yellow... black.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.760
Why did you take Daddy's pen?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.160
Let gm!

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.880
How long until your exam?
- Six weeks.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.480
Did Baba tutor you? How long?

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.720
Two hours.
- Did he scold you?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.880
What's the use of studying?
- What?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.000
You'll end up with kitchen duty
like your sister-in-law here.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.800
Poor girl.
- We learn that too.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.720
What?
- How to cook.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.560
What?
- Domestic science.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.840
Oh.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.200
Is this how you neglect the earning
member of the family?

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.960
He's been home a while now.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.960
What can I do? We ran out of tea.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.840
I had to run over to the neighbors'.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.240
You borrowed tea?
- What choice do I have?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.280
If you don't have your tea when you
get home, you kick up a fuss.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.920
Of course.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.080
You pay no attention to appearances.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200
Some tea!

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.320
They're misers to the bone.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.320
What was Baba asking about?

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.360
Glasses, as always.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680
Poor man.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.160
He does those crossword
puzzles at night.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.120
Not only do they cost money,
but he's ruining his eyes too.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.680
The man has to have something to do.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.840
He could tutor private
students again.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320
He's better now.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.040
Thanks to your nursing.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.480
I won't allow it.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.760
Cover my head, please.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.600
You think I want him to work?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.240
But when I think of the family
- - By the way...

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.200
did you get Ma's scented tobacco?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.480
She reminded you a few times.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.040
Okay. I'll take care of that.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.280
But you handle the problem
of Baba's glasses.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.160
After all, he listens to you.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.800
Drink this, Baba.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.120
How much longer must I take this
bitter medicine of yours?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.280
You've to take care of your health.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.400
Oh, what use is this old body?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.800
Oh God!
I still won't be able to work.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.040
You could get out a bit...

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.360
and go visit the park in
the morning and evening.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.480
I've gone to that park, my dear.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.440
It's just a lot of rabble
who gather to gossip.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.520
Even the older folks there...

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.360
do nothing but gossip
and criticize others.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.880
I'd no idea Calcutta
had changed so much.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.720
Will you talk to Bhombol?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
About glasses?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.200
Yes.
He won't listen to me these days.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.400
He's changed somehow.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.640
You won't listen either, Baba.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.640
You sit up doing your crosswords
every night.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.960
Some water?
- Yes.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.520
Oh, my! Your eyes are so red.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.960
I'll get some cool water.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.400
These eyes...

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.360
I'll get some cool water.
Just splash it on your eyes.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.720
Please get up a bit,
Ma, or you'll get a backache.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.280
Let me cook the fish.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.280
How are you preparing it?
- The way you like it, son.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.240
Dum Pukhz (dish).
- Yes.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.000
Then don't let her cook it.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.760
We only have fish three
times a week as it is.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.120
Fine, I'll prepare it.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.240
But she cooks very well too.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.240
All right, Ma...

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.240
but tomorrow you rest the whole day.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200
Are you going out?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.640
Yes, to see my private student...

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.680
and see if he can pay up.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.640
Would you get some change
from my coat pocket?

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.240
How's the household account?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.440
There's enough for three days.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.280
And we still owe two months'
tuition for Bani. - I know.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.960
So...
- Listen.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.840
Maybe we could ask your friend
Abani for a loan?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.960
Don't you know their situation?

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.440
Some relatives came to stay...

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.960
so they're both working
to make ends meet.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.800
What do you mean, both?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.680
Husband and wife.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.080
I'll be back by 8:30.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.640
Don't pull so much, Ma.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.640
Am I pulling or are you?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.160
Bani.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.440
Get him to fall asleep
in here from now on.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.560
As he gets bigger...

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.440
carrying him from room to room...

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
Kids are heavier when they're
asleep, aren't they?

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.720
Bani, aren't you cold there?
- No.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.640
If I am,
I just roll up in the blanket.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.520
You hear me, dear?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.120
Ma, Baba's calling you.
- I heard.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.840
You hear me?
- For heaven's sake!

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240
What are you shouting about?

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.480
Have you got any money?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.200
Didn't I give you some
the other day?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.360
You don't have any more?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.480
I'm not the one who keeps
the money around here.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.760
I thought maybe you'd
some set aside.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.560
I suppose it's for another
crossword contest.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.200
Addicted to such things at your age!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.640
I just might win some money.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.040
Don't tell me those stories.
I don't like it.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.680
Why?
- Why?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.480
Do any of your stories make
any practical sense?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320
When did money ever
come to us easily?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.000
We're a burden on our son.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.520
If we hadn't come here,
they wouldn't be in such straits.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.360
Yet all you can think of is money...

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.040
and more money!

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.280
What am I supposed to do?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.560
We have some claim on our son.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.240
That's the schoolmaster's lot,
I suppose.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.360
That's the way it is.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.400
All your life you sweat...

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.560
trying to educate children...

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.320
sowing the seeds of knowledge
in their minds.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.080
Then they go trotting off...

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.120
to become judges and magistrates...

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.320
leaving you like an ox
yoked to the mill.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.160
So on one level...

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.920
I'm proud of my students...

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.800
but I'm jealous too.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.760
There's an injustice
in it somewhere.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.400
The Almighty's accounts are
out of balance somewhere.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.360
You're feeling better now,
aren't you?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.680
If I get lucky just once...

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.960
we'll leave all this behind...

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.000
and go to Cape Comorin.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.880
There's a bridge there
that monkeys built.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.520
We'll go see it with our own eyes.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.520
Are you leaving?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.440
This is the last time
I give you any money.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.000
Fine, fine.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.480
Someone can make a million
manufacturing cheap cigarettes...

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.880
but a bank employee with
a BA can only go bald...

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.280
worrying about finances.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.280
What are you thinking about?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.520
What are you thinking about?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.800
What does your friend's wife do?
- Why?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.680
Where did that come from?
- Tell me.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.440
She's a schoolteacher. Why?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.960
I couldn't teach!

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.280
Teaching isn't...

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.680
What job could I get with
just one year of college?

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.880
Who told you to get a job?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.720
So you don't think I can
- as usual! Let me by.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.760
Good heavens! What did I say?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.040
You don't want me to work?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.480
Answer me. Well?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.400
Keep me as your servant,
fair lady...

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.160
Hush!

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.880
One good thing about living
around here:...

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.920
no need to buy a radio.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.360
Mr. Lion...

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.200
Well?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.520
Tell me honestly.
- What?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.320
Do you want me to work or don't you?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.040
No.
- No what?

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.040
I don't want you to.
- You don't?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.360
If you were a bit less attractive...

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.960
I might have wanted
you to get a job.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.560
If a girl like you worked
in an office...

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.200
all the male employees'
output would drop.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.280
There's a saying in English...

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.920
A woman's place...

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.760
is in the home.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.920
You believe that?
- Yes.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.160
I'm very conservative,
like my father.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.160
A housewife should stay
in her house...

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.240
and not wander about.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.160
Dear.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.920
I'm going to get a job.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.160
Did you hear what I said?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.120
I'll get a job.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.400
It's true.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.240
It's not right for you to bear
all the responsibility.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.640
I don't know why I didn't
see it earlier.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.680
You work so hard...

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.800
going to the office...

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.920
and tutoring private students.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.640
Everything you earn you
turn over to me...

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.360
keeping nothing for yourself.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.360
And what do I do?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.240
I never saw how you were suffering.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.320
No.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.520
Things can't go on like this.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.400
I'll get a job.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.160
Any job I can get with my education.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.080
What do you think?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.280
What on earth?
- What?

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.040
Let me sleep.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.720
Wanted: New faces. Boys...

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.120
Wanted: an M.Com.
- Brother...

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.720
your bathwater's ready.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.960
Wanted immediately: a whole-time
lady doctor...

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.080
Brother.
- MBBS.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.640
What are you looking at?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.400
Sultan for a Day, Robin Hood...

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.480
You're going to the movies?
- What's it to you?

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.080
By yourselves?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.960
Couldn't we all go in two months?

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.800
What's it say here?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.080
Wanted.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.520
Wanted a girl who can
keep her mouth shut.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.560
Listen.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.920
I'm looking for a job...

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.360
but not a word to anyone.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.040
If anyone finds out, then...

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.680
You mean Ma and Baba?
- Now beat it.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.320
What kind of job?
- Nothing's definite yet.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.120
I've got it.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.120
Film star! You'd be perfect.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.800
Dark glasses,
lots of red lipstick...

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.120
and 100,000 rupees per picture.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.400
And if it's a Hindi film,
we'll all fly to Bombay.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.560
Something is burning in the kitchen.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.360
Go on.
- No, you go.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.680
And you study domestic science?
Beat it!

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.280
Listen to this.
- What?

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.720
Come here a minute.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560
Listen.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.440
This might work.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.880
Wanted a smart and attractive...

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.840
A smart and attractive young girl...

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.240
to serve as a salesgirl.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.280
Salesgirl?
- Hang on.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.320
You wouldn't be hawking wares
out in the street!

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.480
To serve as a salesgirl...

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.840
in a respectable firm.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.120
Must be a matriculate.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.000
Starting salary:...

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.440
rupees 100.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.800
You remember my starting salary?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800
All right.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.400
What's that mean?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.480
It means let's submit
an application.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.160
I'll have one typed up at work,
and you'll sign it.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.160
I'll sign it?
- Why not?

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.640
Me?

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.640
If you don't sign it, who will?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.440
Lady Mountbatten?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.200
Go away.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.960
Do you write our last name in
English with a J or a Z?

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.720
Z, the first letter in zoo.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.200
Who's going to the zoo?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.560
Here.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.600
I'll go get some paan (betel-leaf).

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.720
Who's going to the zoo?

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.840
You and Mommy...

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.240
and Daddy and Auntie.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.800
When?
- Sunday after next.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.560
That long away?
- Daddy's pockets are empty now.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.320
Don't chew paan before
your interview.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.480
Makes a bad impression. Understand?

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.560
Is there something wrong with red?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.760
Listen.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.880
No, never mind.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.680
Tell me...

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.840
what if they call me
in for an interview?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.880
Then you go.
- Yes, but...

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.200
But what?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.760
What do I say here at home?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.280
Say you're going to your
father's house.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.720
It wouldn't be that far off.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.400
A boss is like a father.
Both are providers.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.680
All right?

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.600
I'm off.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.520
Is your father home?

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.520
I told you to put life and not wife.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.240
See? It was life.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.760
I'm just a
- Take these.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.440
You may have taught English,
but as they say...

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.480
common sense is the secret
to a crossword.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.880
I only have a FA,
and you've an MA and BT.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.360
But you still lost.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.960
What's this all about?

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.560
It's checkered like a chessboard.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.200
You've to fit in the
right English words.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.360
You can win 7,000 rupees.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.040
You know anybody who's won?
- People win all the time.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.720
Whoever makes the fewest
mistakes wins...

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.000
and if it's a tie,
the prize is divided up.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.280
What?

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.080
Another near miss!

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.240
Looks doubtful to me. Look at the...

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.120
G.S. N. Ganguly.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.200
Doesn't he live on Heysham Row?

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.320
Let's call him.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.240
You've approved his checks before.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.640
Yes,
but never for such a large amount.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.240
Hello.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.400
A letter came.
- Already?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.960
Yes. I've an interview Wednesday
at 10:00 a.m.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.280
Very good.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.320
Will you go with me?

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.240
Me?
Sit around with a bunch of women?

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.240
Won't you take me?
- We'll see. Where's the office?

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.080
Mission Row.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.600
And the letter was signed
by a Mr. Mukherjee.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.360
A Bengali!

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.640
The signature's very mature,
and the firm bears his name.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.160
Very good.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.880
Tell me...
- What?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.520
Listen, I have clients waiting.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.320
Forget your work for a moment.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.080
So...

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.440
what kind of questions
will they ask?

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.200
They'll ask,
Where does the tree spirit live?

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.960
And you answer, In the treetops.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.600
Here's your ticket.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.040
It came.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.760
(Radio news)

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.000
(Radio news)

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.720
(Radio news)

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.120
(Radio news)

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.880
(Radio news)

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.920
Didn't I tell you?
The interview was really long.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.760
Where are you going?
- To see Baba.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.440
Starting next month, right?

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.600
Why only 100 rupees?

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.800
It should have been more.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.400
Even Dipti's driver
- - Hush.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.240
What's that letter? I want to see.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.640
Let me see.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.520
What now?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.240
First we have to bell the cat.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.280
You mean Baba?

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240
Here.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.440
You want some tea?

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.680
Let me tackle this first.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.840
Shouldn't we tell Ma too?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.800
That's a minor obstacle.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.160
Spray under the table too.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.040
Look, now it's run out.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.640
Now you deal with the mosquitoes
on your own.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.200
What do you want?

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.560
Aarti got a job.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.480
Who did?
- Aarti.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.480
What did she get?
- A job.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.360
She got a job?

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.280
Yes. She already accepted it.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.120
It's a very good job.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.840
I mean, with a very good firm.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.080
She applied...

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.200
and went for an interview.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.120
The appointment letter came today.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.920
She starts next month.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.760
It's a salesgirl position.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.960
She'll make 100 rupees a month.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.160
Salesgirl?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.640
My daughter-in-law?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.560
I'm trying to find a
part-time job too.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.920
Then she'll quit.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.880
I've thought about it a lot.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.360
My salary alone isn't enough.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.920
My daughter-in-law.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.800
I suppose you'll Say...

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.480
you supported a large family
all by yourself...

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.200
and that Ma never had
to go out and work.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.240
I'm not denying that.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.920
But times have changed.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.440
It's a new day, and we've to change.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.120
We have to accept it.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.480
Change comes by necessity.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.400
We've no choice but
to take this step.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.160
What does Ara say?

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.120
She took the job of
her own free will.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.800
It wasn't a whim. She had to.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.760
Once I get things straightened out,
she'll quit.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.920
Ara has changed.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.200
It couldn't be helped.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.000
I suppose you've something
to say too.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.640
Ever since we came here...

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.760
it's like we've become strangers.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.440
Listen.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.600
The cold war has begun.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960
I know.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.040
You know how long it will last?

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880
How long?

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.400
Till the day you get your
first month's pay...

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.480
and buy Baba a pair of glasses.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.040
It would've been nice if
no one had objected.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.800
I'm hurting so many people.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.360
Are you upset?

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.960
Me?

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.200
I'm worried about one thing.
- What?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.200
The girls I saw the day
of the interview...

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.240
all looked so fashionable.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.560
So tip-top.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.280
How can I go to work in
my tattered slippers?

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.080
Give me a list of what you
need to look fashionable.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.360
I'll get an advance from the office.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.240
All right?

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.800
Aarti's looking very nice today.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.320
Don't I look nice every day?

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.680
She's fishing for a present from
your first month's pay.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.120
You look nice too.
- No! Both of us?

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.240
Yes, because you're both eating
together for once.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.720
Like a bride and groom
on their wedding day.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.520
All right. You needn't go on.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.960
Where's Pintu?
- Over there.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240
Pinto.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.080
Pintu, sweetie?

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.840
You think he's mad?
- Go and see.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.040
I'll go see.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.040
Why just Pintu?
Someone else is mad too.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.080
You know what Bernard Shaw
says about working women?

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840
Forget it.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.440
Are you angry?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.880
Listen to me.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.560
Go away.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.280
I'll buy you a really nice toy.
- I don't want one!

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.320
Pintu, I'll buy you some nice toys.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.480
Listen to me.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.280
Pinto. Pinto.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.120
Pintu, listen.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.560
Don't be angry, sweetheart.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.720
Listen to me. Pintu!

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.480
No, no, no! Just go away!
- Pintu!

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.080
If we don't go now...

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.840
the streetcar will be too crowded.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.400
Let's go.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.640
Let's go.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.240
I'm going now, Ma.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.480
Good-bye.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.200
Come on.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.920
Mother.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.400
What toys?

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.640
Whatever you want, my child.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.560
Son.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.560
What are you thinking about...

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.640
smart and attractive?

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400
What time is it?

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.160
9:30. Why?

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.360
It's Pintu's bath time.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.800
Don't worry. He'll get his bath.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.840
I know.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.800
Are you nervous?

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.680
What's this?

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.400
Your hand's ice-cold!
How can this be?

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.320
It happened once before.
- When?

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.520
Our wedding day.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.960
I'm more worried about
Pintu's mother...

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.560
than about Pintu.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.560
Can you manage with all
this on your mind?

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.520
We'll see.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960
Hello.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.160
I think we've interviews
on the same day.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.520
What silly questions they ask?

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.440
Was that your boyfriend?

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.160
The one who waved back.
Your boyfriend?

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.920
No.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.320
Oh I see. Your husband?

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.760
You know what this means. This ring?

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.040
It means I am engaged.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.840
To be married.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.120
Number six or is it number seven?

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.080
Mukherjee and Mukherjee.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.920
Do you speak English?

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.960
A little.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.560
Well, I can follow Bengali.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.600
A little.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.880
So I think we will
get along alright.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.560
Mukherjee...

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.200
Hello.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.160
I was here before.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.600
I'm sort of busy now.
- Is the family all right?

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.720
Yes.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.320
What have you come for?
To open an account?

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.520
That's what I had in mind...

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.840
but I'm concerned about
something I heard.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.280
What's that?

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.400
About runs on a few banks recently.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.720
That may be.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.840
Bengalis love to spread rumors.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.320
A rumor gets started about a bank...

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.640
and people panic.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.240
Especially after that incident
with the Jagat Dhatri Bank.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.480
If you're unsure,
don't open an account.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.960
Wait a while.
- No, no.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.760
If you say so,
I trust the position is sound.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.200
Savings or current account?
- Savings.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.920
I'm just hesitant...

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.680
because it's not very much.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.320
After you've learned to use it,
your job would be...

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.680
to personally go door-to-door...

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.640
and market the machine.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.400
The average household...

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.560
won't be able to afford the Autonit.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.880
Your target is the upper-income
group.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.520
Each of you'll have a zone to cover.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.720
You must knock on every
door in your zone.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.720
If you can meet the housewives,
show them this booklet...

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.800
talk to them,
and demonstrate the machine...

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.200
you'll be successful.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.920
Now, you may ask...

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.400
is there any guarantee we'll
meet the lady of the house?

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.240
I'd say no, there is no guarantee.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.960
But there's one thing I
must tell you clearly.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.760
Nobody really likes canvassers.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.160
One more thing.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.320
In the afternoon,
just when housewives are resting...

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.960
canvassers knock...

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.080
and disturb their rest.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.480
The women get angry...

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.520
and sometimes treat you badly.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.880
This is all part of the job.
There's nothing you can do.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.960
But it's not a good idea
to be too insistent...

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.480
and make a nuisance of yourselves.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.720
But if you can get your
foot in the door...

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.200
and speak to the lady
of the house...

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.160
then with the qualities
of the Autonit...

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.400
and your skills of persuasion...

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.560
there's no reason why
a successful...

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.320
transaction shouldn't take place.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.760
Mukherjee.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.480
Yes?

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.760
Mrs. Mazumdar?

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.280
Hold on.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.040
Are you Mrs. Mazumdar?

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.960
Are you telling the truth?

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.240
Hello?

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.480
Aarti?
- Yes.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.560
No problem, right?

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280
No. I have to go.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.240
Listen.
- What?

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.440
Wait for me after work.
I'll come by for you.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.360
Okay. I have to go.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.440
Sir, is that you? How are you?

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.120
It's been ages.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.480
Just look how you've grown!

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.760
Please come inside.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.400
You've grown in both
fame and appearance.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.960
I wouldn't have recognized
you on the street.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.600
But I'd have recognized you.
Come sit down.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.040
Have a seat on my throne.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.560
You used to have glasses,
didn't you?

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.760
Yes, I did.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.960
I lost them on the train
coming to Calcutta.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.280
I haven't been able to
get new ones since.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.720
I've often told my son...

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.920
My pupil is now a big
eye specialist.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.640
Get me an appointment with him.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.640
But he just doesn't listen to me.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.480
Where do you live?

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.760
Close by, in Kalighat...

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.400
not far from the cremation
grounds by the Ganges...

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.200
so I'm ready for...

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.200
the Master's call.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.040
Lots of boys from our class
are here in Calcutta now.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.440
You remember Anupam?
Anupam Ray Choudhury?

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.200
He's a big barrister now.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.160
Then there's Bibhash Chakravarty.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.920
He's port commissioner now.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.280
A good job.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.800
Nobendu's a doctor.
They were all your pupils.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.680
What's this, sir?

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.200
Why are your eyes watering?
What is it?

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.800
Pranab, I'm in dire straits.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.080
I have no income...

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.800
no money.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.960
Maybe so. But why get so upset?

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.800
You can't imagine...

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.920
how embarrassed I'm to
tell you all this.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.880
You mustn't worry.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.680
This is nothing.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.480
You simply need glasses.
There's no shame in that.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.160
They won't cost you anything.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.200
After all, you have a claim on us.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.400
You taught us our first lessons,
didn't you?

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.840
I wonder if the others
feel the same way.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.320
I'm just repaying my
debt to my teacher.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280
All right?

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.360
Well said, my son.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.160
Repaying my debt to my teacher.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.200
Well said.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.640
Yes?

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.880
No.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.800
Is madam in?
- What do you want?

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.720
I'm here on business.
- Come in.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.600
Please have a seat.
I'll tell madam.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.080
Sit down.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.120
So stupid.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.400
Don't do it.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.400
Bobu, come and say sorry.
- No, I won't.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.440
Bobu.
- No, no, no.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.600
You're being noisy again.
Don't you know someone's sick?

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.960
Go upstairs now.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.840
Hello.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.880
I've probably come at a bad time.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.400
No, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Sit down.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.160
Did you embroider this?

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.480
That was long ago.
I do very little of that now.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.920
What can I do for you?

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.120
I represent a firm that
makes a machine...

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.960
Machine? Electrical?
- No, no.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.680
Oh, a knitting machine. Very good.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.480
You see, I've got little
children in the house.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.480
You can knit with your own hands.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.040
You can knit a sweater
in just about an hour.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.880
Ma, Nicky wants you!

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.840
Sit with him for a minute, darling.
I'm coming.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.240
My little one is sick.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640
What is it?

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.040
He has a constant cough...

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.160
and yesterday he developed a fever.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.400
Have you tried homeopathy?

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.800
Sometimes it works rather...

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.520
Can this knit different patterns?

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.800
Yes, you can see a few in the back.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.920
How much does it cost?

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.840
Don't worry about that.
You'd hardly notice it.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.720
May I come give you a demonstration
one day?

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.640
Ma, Nicky won't listen to me!

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.120
Next Wednesday at the same time?

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.080
All right,
because until I actually see it...

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.120
Good. I'll be back next Wednesday.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.760
I've heard about this machine...

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.680
but never seen it work.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.120
Your name and address?

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.360
Mrs. Sinha, 8/7 Alipore Park Road.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.400
At first I didn't understand.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.720
The man said, please come in.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.480
I'll tell my Wife.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.800
So I followed him inside.
How was I to know?

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.520
Anyone else would have known.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.240
You wouldn't have either!

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.560
What did he look like?
- Well...

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.800
Was he good-looking or not?
- I don't know. It was very dark.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.080
Dark? At that time of day?

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.840
Maybe you were a bit disoriented.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.600
The shutters were all closed.
It was a hot day.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.520
Fine. Then what happened?

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.320
Then...
I just sat in the drawing room.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.480
What a beautiful room!
On the floor was a...

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.560
Get to the point!

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.080
I'm getting there.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.560
I sat and waited while
the man disappeared.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.240
To get his wife.
- Right.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.120
After some time...

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.640
he came back and sat
on the sofa near me.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.880
Across from you or next to you?

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.320
Just keep quiet!

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.480
Didn't you ask where his wife was?

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.240
I kept thinking, she's coming,
she's coming...

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.160
but she didn't come
and didn't come...

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.200
and then the man...

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.960
What?

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.200
He just kept staring at me.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.800
Was he smiling?
- Smiling?

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.520
I could barely stammer...

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.720
is your wife coming?

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.880
What a question!
is your wife coming?

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.560
Then what?

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.360
The man says...

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.760
What wife?

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.920
I'm a bachelor.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.400
Good heavens!

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.120
What did you say?

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.600
Listen, listen.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.520
Then he says...

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.240
And I don't see any
vermilion mark...

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.880
on your forehead either.

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.920
What did you say?

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.000
What happened?

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.120
I don't like that man.
- Why?

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.840
I don't think he likes me either.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.680
Not after this.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.880
What? No commission.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.920
First he says no, not a paisa.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.520
And then?

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.040
It's too soon to expect
a commission.

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.160
And something about
trading position...

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.760
and you can't tell about
business and all that.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.320
Say it in Hindi.
- And then?

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.280
And then I started to fight.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.960
And insist and said...

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.520
they gave 10% to the
girls at Magnum.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.800
And we do the same kind
of work as they do.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.400
So why shouldn't we get 10% too.
Damn it!

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.560
That's why we sent you.
- And then?

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.360
Then he came around a little...

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.800
and said, he has been thinking
about it. That big fat liar.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.560
And said, not 10% but 5%.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.200
Five percent?

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.080
Let me finish.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:43.360
5% on the first five
machine we sell.

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.640
And then 10% on each one after that,
per month.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.640
And we will get a commission
with the...

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.440
first month's salary on Monday.

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.640
Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.520
Oh yes.
Aarti, the boss wants to see you.

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.440
Me?
- Yes, you.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.640
You've done so much for us,
we must get you some sweet-balls.

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.080
Mate sweet-balls.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.800
Next Para.

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.800
We still hope that...

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.120
you will settle this account...

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.440
without further delay.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.080
And thus save yourself...

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.080
the inconvenience...

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.400
and considerable cost...

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.160
of a legal action.

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.800
Yours faithfully.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.440
That's all.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.360
I will send this letter.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.480
Miss Simmons was in here earlier.

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:05.160
I suppose she was acting
as your representative.

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.320
Right?

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.720
If you've some collective
grievance...

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.440
best to send one person...

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.280
instead of all of you
crowding in here.

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.040
I have no objection to that.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.440
And if your demand is reasonable...

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.320
I have no problem with that.

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.120
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.280
There are five of you...

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.440
four Bengalis...

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.120
and one Anglo-Indian.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.760
So why doesn't one of you
four represent the group?

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.680
Why must that Anglo-Indian
be your leader?

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.840
What qualities in her...

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.360
made you make her your
representative?

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.760
Do you think Miss Simmons
got you the commission...

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.920
due to some amazing
skill on her part?

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.600
That I lost to her?

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.120
That's not the case at all,
Mrs. Mazumdar.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.560
I'd already decided to give
you a commission...

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.840
after a month or two.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.720
So it's not as if Miss Simmons...

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.880
is somehow responsible.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.040
I had to be a bit harsh with her...

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.120
because I don't like
insolent people.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.360
If you'd brought this
proposal to me...

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.800
I know you'd have put
it very politely...

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.240
and there'd have been no argument.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.400
Will you remember that
in the future?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.320
If there's something to discuss,
you come.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.000
Then all parties will benefit.
All right?

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.560
May I go?
- Yes, of course.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.800
How do you like the work?

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.040
I like it.
- I like it too...

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.440
your work, that is.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.000
Some customers have sent letters
praising your work.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.640
Go on now.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.760
Mrs. Mazumdar.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.160
Sign here.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.960
Would you knit my grandson a
sweater on your machine...

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.160
if I bring you the wool?
- Certainly.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.360
Miss Simmons.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.520
Thank you.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.160
"Counting house, counting..."

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.280
Hey. He has given you such nice
new notes, and look at these.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.840
All crumbled and dirty, and smelly.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.120
Give me yours,
and I'll give you mine.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.440
Don't be silly. I was only joking.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.000
Take them.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.160
Alright. You give me 5 and I'll give
you 5 dirty ones in exchange.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960
All right.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Thank you.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.400
Happy now?

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.600
A little gift for you,
for being so nice.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.560
What?

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.800
Take it.
It's a nice one. I haven't used it.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.360
No. What would I do with it?

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.960
Use it stupid.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.240
Why not? What's wrong with
using a little lipstick?

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.280
You put red here, red here.
Why not here?

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.800
I don't know how to use it.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.240
Not too much. Just a little.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.120
Alright. If you don't like it,
you can take it off.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.120
Will got Indian book on sex,
you know. Famous one.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.480
And said Indian girls used
to paint their lips.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.200
Eyebrows,
fingernails and everything.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.480
They all did. So why shouldn't you?

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.840
There. Now look.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.040
Don't you like it? It's very nice.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.520
Give me a tissue. - There'll be
trouble if I use my handkerchief.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.000
And keep this.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.920
It's good for business.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.360
What's going on?

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.880
A pistol?

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.920
What's this?
- Open it and see.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.440
Bani, come with me.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.560
Take it.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.280
Mother.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.200
Daddy, wind this up for me.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.880
On the bottom.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.520
Did you spend your whole salary?

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200
This is my salary...

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.280
and...

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.680
What's that?
- Commission.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.960
Commission?
- That's right.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.880
You didn't tell me about that!

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.560
Remember that Anglo-Indian
girl I told you about?

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.760
She fought with Mr. Himangshu
and got us all a commission.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.640
Mr. Himangshu?
- Our boss.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.680
Give me that.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.000
Mr. Mukherjee.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.520
And you know what the boss told me?

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.880
What?

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.320
I'm not telling.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.760
He said...

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.240
I'm doing very good work.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.480
Ma.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.640
Some scented tobacco for you.
Is it the right kind?

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.680
I got paid today...

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.160
so I went shopping.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.200
That's why I was late.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.640
WW buy anything for me?

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.960
Don't say that, Ma.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.160
You mustn't think you've to
buy me anything special.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.120
Your father-in-law's an old man now.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.800
He's devoted his whole
life to studying...

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.880
and teaching children.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.680
Now he has no job.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.720
Take care of him.
That's enough for me.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.880
Today is Baba's birthday.
- That's right.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.160
If he's happy, so am I.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.200
I got paid today, Baba.
I brought you some fruit.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.640
Today's your birthday.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.240
Leave the fruit,
but I won't take your money.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.040
I'd be happy if you would.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.480
No, Aarti, you can't change
my mind so easily.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.960
And I'm too old to change my views.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.360
Do what makes you happy.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.080
I won't stand in your way.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.640
But don't try to make me
share in your happiness.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.680
I can't.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.480
I'll leave the fruit.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440
Mommy.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.000
Yes, sweetheart?

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.640
Baba won't look at my toys.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.600
Go try again. I'm sure he'll look.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.520
Listen...

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.800
where did Baba get those glasses?

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280
Glasses?

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.240
The ones I saw on his table.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.400
They must be Mr. Sinha's.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.520
Where else would he get glasses?

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.880
Really?

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
What else could it be?

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.400
Maybe so.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.320
I'm just tired of thinking.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.040
Has peace been declared?
- No.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.960
I'll have a bath today.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.120
Will we ever get a fan?

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.880
We can afford one in a month or so,
don't you think?

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.720
At the rate you're earning
commissions, why just a fan?

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.880
We'll soon be able to afford
an air conditioner.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.240
I told Mr. Himangshu today...

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.520
I'm scared to come into your office.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.320
It's so cool,
I'm afraid I'll catch a cold!

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.120
You know what he said?
- What?

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.280
You ladies have knitting
machines now.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.200
Knit yourselves some sweaters
to wear in my office.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.880
Sounds like a very jovial fellow.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.240
Yes...

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.440
but he's very strict too.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.360
He won't tolerate any
slackness on the job.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.600
If we're lax, he really scolds us.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.440
I'll have to come meet him sometime.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.520
Then stop in.
We leave the office at 10:30.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.560
Find some excuse to call
on him after that.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.320
Does he ever scold you?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.520
Me?

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.400
My work is always faultless.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.480
What exactly is your work?

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640
I'll tell you.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.920
I get to the office at 10:00...

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.960
and sign in.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.640
Then we decide what area we'll
each cover that day.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.960
At 10:30 sharp we start
out canvassing.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.000
We go from door to door...

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.920
talking to housewives...

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.920
and setting appointments with them.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.200
Then we go back with the machine...

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.880
and give them a demonstration.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.600
Then, when the machine is sold...

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.040
there's the payment,
the invoice, the sales report...

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.440
The commission.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.840
You wouldn't recognize
me on the job.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.080
What about at home?

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.920
Would I recognize you at home?

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.360
You don't recognize me?

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600
Tell me honestly.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.800
Why not?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.160
It all feels a bit unfamiliar.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.040
It feels a bit...

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.360
What about this?

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.960
You don't recognize my mole?

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.080
I'm still the same housewife.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.120
Yes.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.760
Manoj?

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.440
It's Subrata.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.400
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.960
No,
I don't forget you when I need you.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960
What do you need?

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.880
I need a favor...

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.960
that is, if you're a friend in need.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.160
Tell me about this favor
and this need.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.160
They come to the same thing.
I need a job.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.920
A job? For whom?
- For me.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.560
Don't you have a job?
- Yes...

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.160
but I mean in addition to that.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.960
Anything part-time that
pays 70-75 rupees.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.600
You know so many people.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.240
I could use a little help.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.960
Who said you can get a
job over the phone?

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.360
No, this is just a warning.
I'll stop by.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.560
Then hang up and come straight over.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.640
It's already lunch time.
Make a little effort.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.200
Pamper me a bit.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.920
Sure, but not today. Tomorrow.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.680
You think there's a chance?

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.280
I can't guarantee you a job...

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.960
but I've got some good
American cigarettes...

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.800
fresh off the boat.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.000
Sounds good. I'll stop by.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.680
Talk to you later.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.960
Pintu.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.520
Pintu has a fever.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.920
A fever?

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.560
Yes. We've been waiting for you.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.000
In here.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.400
Your mommy's here.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.240
When did it start?
- This afternoon.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.680
He kept saying he didn't
want to eat.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.600
Mommy's home now.
Let's go to our room.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.200
He said he's not talking to you.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.480
Let's go.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.080
You're not talking to me?

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.560
What?

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.200
I told him to go play
with his auntie.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.240
Come, child.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.800
Then he suddenly just
lay down on the bed.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.480
Then I understood.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.040
I felt his forehead,
and he was warm.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.640
He had some milk and
barley this evening.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.480
All day long it was, Mommy, Mommy.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.440
When is Mommy coming home?

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.280
Why does she have to go to work?

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.200
Mommy's mean.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.200
Mommy's naughty.
I'm going to spank her.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.120
And on and on.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.720
So You're very angry are you? '

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.800
You're going to hit Mommy
with your pistol?

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800
What if Mommy brings you a new toy?

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.400
What toy?

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.040
What toy? We'll have to see.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.240
Let me wash up first.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.120
Shall we take him to the clinic?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.400
Is it a high fever?

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.280
No, maybe 100.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.120
Shall I go borrow a thermometer?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.280
Yes. Tell them we'll return
it in the morning.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.680
Get me a really good toy.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.680
The streetcars weren't running.
Did you take a bus?

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.240
Quit your job.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.280
I'm getting a part-time job.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.640
I called a friend today.
He promised to help.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.800
You'd be working twice as hard.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.360
That' s what we deemed, Ara.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.640
I'd get a part-time job,
and you'd quit working.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.760
But...
- No buts.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.080
I've given this a lot of thought.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.120
Did you think about the money?

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.920
Peace within the family is
more important than money.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.200
Mommy, what toy?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.400
You realize Baba hasn't
spoken to me...

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.240
in a month and a half?

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.840
I'm setting it here.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.120
I'm doing such good work.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.760
Is that bothering you?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.640
You know what your good
work has done?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.080
What?

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.480
You're looking thin.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.040
There are dark circles
under your eyes.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.320
I don't feel bad.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.880
Even after working all day,
I don't feel tired.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.400
You really don't want me...

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.720
to work?

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.000
No, I don't.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.480
And Baba doesn't. Ma doesn't.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.480
Even he doesn't.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.480
You'd rather go on making
so many others unhappy?

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.920
It's not the others that concern me.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.280
What matters is what you want.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.520
Mommy, what toy?

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.320
97.8.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.800
Is that a fever?

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.480
Silly! You think 98 is a fever?

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.600
Then what is? Two hundred?

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.160
Pintu's fever is gone.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.640
Should I return the thermometer?

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.480
Yes, do.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.120
Do I get a toy even
if my fever's gone?

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.920
Of course, darling. Now go lie down.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.600
Here.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.080
Sign this.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.800
Finding a job is hard...

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.160
but quitting one is easy.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.680
All it takes is a letter.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.040
There's some trouble at your bank,
sir.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.960
You should go see. There is a crowd.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.080
What?

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.240
Good morning.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.760
Since you were late, I...

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.760
One minute.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.440
Don't go any closer.
The crowd is furious.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.120
Me?

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.133
Mukherjee. Oh, how are you?

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.840
230.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.240
All right.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.680
Thank you, brother. Thank you.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.480
Now, then...

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.440
first, your colleague Miss Simmons
isn't coming in today.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.640
She had a demonstration scheduled
for today at 12:00.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.680
It's a good prospect.
You'll have to handle it.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.480
If you can manage English, fine.
Otherwise, use Hindi.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.360
Jewish lady. Mrs. Koi.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.120
All right?

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.840
Second...

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.160
I have some plans.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.120
Not immediately,
but in the near future.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.440
Open the doors!

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.920
There's the scoundrel!

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.120
Come to watch the fun?

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.600
Get him!

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.320
We're ruined thanks to you!
- What did I do?

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.480
Now the scoundrel's making excuses!

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.360
Why are you hitting him?

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.400
Will it get you your money back?

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.400
We'll be taking on some
new salesgirls...

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.440
so the nature of your
job may change a bit.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.960
But I
- - Mrs. Mazumdar...

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.760
I don't like the word but...

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160
it's a very ugly word.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.200
I'm banking on you.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.840
I'd like you to take on
more responsibility.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.760
You can handle it.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.760
I've seen your work these
last two months.

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.560
I want to start working
in a group system...

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.320
and I want you to be group leader.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.840
You'd no longer have
to go door-to-door.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.440
You'd simply coordinate
the others' work...

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.400
supervise them...

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.680
collect the daily sales reports.

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.080
You'll manage the day-to-day
expenses.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.960
But Mr. Mukherjee...

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.200
Mukherjee.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.440
I've told you before.
- For me?

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.720
I won't take no for an answer.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.360
Hello.
- Did you give him the letter?

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.960
No, not yet...

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.160
Don't. I lost my job.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.960
The bank collapsed.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.360
Don't give him the letter.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:37.960
I'll explain tonight.
Don't be scared.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.680
Everything will be fine.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.080
Don't worry. I've got to go.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.560
I wrote it down.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.160
Mrs. Benjamin Cohen,
24 Royad Street, 12:00.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.560
Okay?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.240
What is it?

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.560
Mrs. Mazumdar?

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.520
That call earlier was
from my husband.

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.440
Yes, I guessed that.
- He lost his job.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.240
What?
- There was no warning.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.640
Where? What was he doing?

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.440
The New Bharat Bank.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.760
It's closed down.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.200
All these banks sprouting up
- - I need a raise.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.360
Didn't you say my work was good...

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.800
and my future bright?

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.240
At least a 50-rupee raise.
I can't manage without it.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.680
Mrs. Mazumdar...

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.720
there's no doubt about
your efficiency.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.720
That's why I'm giving you
greater responsibility.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.320
But not immediately.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.640
It will take two or three months.

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.920
There's a process involved in
raises, and you've only...

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.080
I can't manage without
a 50-rupee raise.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.840
Or I'll have to explore
other avenues.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.360
What other avenues, Mrs. Mazumdar?

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.440
Are there so many just waiting
for you to explore?

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.960
I'm asking you: Please
see what you can do.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.160
Mrs. Mazumdar...

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.240
you are too impulsive...

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.640
and impulsiveness can
lead to trouble.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.080
I know, and I apologize.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.680
Very well. I'll give instructions
to Nagen Babu.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.360
But in the strictest confidence.

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.280
Your colleagues must
never know of this.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.960
No one will know. I give my word.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.120
One more thing: Tell your husband...

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.960
not to get a job with another
upstart bank...

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.480
or I'll have to go through
this again.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.760
This is unbelievable.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.320
You were in charge
of a department...

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.840
yet you'd no warning
of such a disaster?

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.920
You had me open an account there.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.680
Position sound, you said.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.560
Where's that position sound now?

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.720
Two thousand rupees gone
down the drain!

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.720
I'll pay back your money over time.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.720
That's not the point.
It's not the money.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.280
Two thousand rupees won't
ruin Nibaron Chatterjee.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.080
I'm thinking of you.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.960
If a run was imminent...

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.000
there was a manager and others...

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.280
you could've discussed things with.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.920
They're the ones who said
the position was sound...

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.080
not me.

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.320
You can't just bury your
nose in your papers.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.520
You have to be sharp and alert.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.520
These aren't simple times.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.680
What do you think?

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.240
Nothing. My opinion is of no value.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.240
I'm outdated now.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.600
Daughter...

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.360
I never thought you'd have
to suffer like this.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.080
Suffer like what, Baba?

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.920
I'm very disappointed, child.
This is...

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.040
Don't worry, Baba.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.120
This isn't anybody's fault.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.920
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.800
He just has to find another job.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.440
I understand that.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.560
But to make you go out and work?

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.360
No one made me go out and work.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.480
It was my own decision...

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.400
and I enjoy it very much.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.800
But now you're the only one...

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.720
Go back inside, Baba.
Your tea's getting cold.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.160
Sister-in-law.

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.760
What's this?

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.840
Have my name removed.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.280
From where?
- The school rolls.

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.480
Have you lost your mind?

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:28.160
You've done well and gotten
such good grades.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.720
Why quit school now?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.600
It's too big an expense for you.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.080
Poor thing.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.600
What would you do then?

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.480
Can't I work?

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.640
Giving you that sari was a mistake.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.880
You're still just a child.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.200
Then tell me what I should do.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:04.120
Will you do what I say?

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.000
The potatoes,
eggplants, and pumpkin...

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.800
are chopped and ready
in the kitchen.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.120
Add the spices and make a curry.
Go on.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.200
I can make the curry?

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.760
But I won't help. Ma won't help.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.080
No one will help.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.040
You won't criticize it later,
will you?

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.840
No, I won't. Go on.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.840
I went to see that friend today...

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.960
who talked about a part-time job.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.040
What happened?

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.840
He says it'll take a month at least.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.920
Shall I tell you some good news?

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.320
Good news?

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.200
I got a 50-rupee raise.

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:19.200
That's great.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.720
The wife's a hero...

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.600
the husband's a zero.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.200
Someone's here to see you.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.960
Who?
- Some old man. He's waiting.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:46.880
All right.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.400
Don't be too long.
The show's at 10:30.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.320
I'm all ready.
- I know, I know.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.120
How are you, sir?

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.720
Anupam?

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.280
Let me have a look at you.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.680
Have I changed a lot?

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.560
No, I recognize you.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.760
Please sit down.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.360
So what brings you here?

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.720
I got your letter when I got
back from court yesterday.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.720
Who gave you my address?
- Your address?

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.480
The man who gave me these glasses...

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.880
one of your old classmates.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.480
Pranab?
- Yes.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.600
Do you see him often?

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:49.440
Yes. I saw him for a consultation
a while back.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.920
I see.
- His practice is going well.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.200
Yours isn't going badly either,
my boy.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.680
This age belongs to all of you.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.120
It's you who work...

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.720
and make our country's
future bright.

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.600
When I see your achievements...

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.560
the heart under this old
bag of bones rejoices.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.680
I trust your health is fine?

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.520
My health?

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.960
My generation is no more.

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.640
We are dead,
crushed into the dust...

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.920
like reptiles.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.840
The backbone's broken, my boy.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.360
If we're still here today...

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.080
it's only due to our
mental strength.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.160
It's very hard.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.280
If my own son doesn't
look after me...

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.400
I know you will.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.800
After all, you're like my own sons.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.360
I raised you like my own sons.

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.920
If you're famous today...

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.800
some credit should go to me.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.440
Didn't I contribute to that?

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.920
Tell me.

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.120
Are you speaking of financial help?

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.480
I prefer not to use the word help.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:20.440
Did Dronacharya
ask Eklavya for help?

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.080
Wait here. I'll be right back.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.760
I suppose he's asking for help.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.200
The Bengali community is like that.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.560
Who is he?

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.560
Our old teacher.

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:49.040
He used to quote Samuel Smiles.
- How much are you giving him?

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.040
Oh! I thought it was a hundred.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
You must be crazy.

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.720
I don't need any fish, Ma.
No need to rush.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.640
It's ready, child.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.160
Here you are.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.800
I have to be at work by 9:30.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.640
The Anglo-Indian girl's been
out for a few days...

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.800
so I have to do her work too.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.880
That's what I'm saying.
You work all day.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.280
If you don't eat well,
how will you manage?

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.600
Sister-in-law.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.800
Did you try the spinach?
- Yes.

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.800
HOW did I do?

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:36.320
You passed.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.760
Just passed?

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.640
First division.

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.000
Should we keep the maid
on or let her go?

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.280
How would you manage the whole day?

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.640
You can see how busy I am.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.520
I get home so late every night.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.200
It's just that she's been asking
for the rest of her wages.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.760
Oh. In that case...

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.320
Listen, you're not doing anything.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.800
Could you get four rupees from
the dresser for the maid?

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.960
Where's the money?
- In my bag.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.600
In the drawer on the right.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.200
No office again today?

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.360
No.
- Why?

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.080
I have the day off.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:40.760
Mommy doesn't get the day off?

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.640
Mommy's office is bad.
- Mommy's office is bad?

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.160
Did you find it?

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.200
There's a 10-rupee bill...

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.720
and seven one-rupee bills.

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.640
They're all together.

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.680
Here.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.680
Listen.

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.560
Where did she go now?

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.360
Sister.

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.200
I'm late.

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.520
I've been calling you forever.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.680
Here's your pay.
Where did you run off to?

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.160
Mommy,
Daddy says your office is bad.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.920
Is that so?

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.840
I'm off now.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.080
I'm going.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.960
Not going to put on your lipstick?

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.960
Mommy, what did you throw?

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.840
Listen to me.

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.160
What?

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.240
Do whatever you like...

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:24.640
but please don't misunderstand me,
darling.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.920
Daddy, is Mommy mad?

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.520
Edith.

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.040
Edith.
- Coming, Mummy.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.960
Hello. What a surprise! Come in.

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.280
I found her waiting downstairs.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.880
Mom, this is Aarti.
She has got the same boss as mine.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.920
She has told me a lot about you.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Come.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.720
How are you?
- I'm fine. Sit down.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.200
Have you taken your temperature,
darling? - No, mom. I'm alright.

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.960
What happened?

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.640
Oh. This is terrible.

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.320
Remember the shower
we'd on Friday.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.040
Would you like cold drink?

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.120
No.

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.680
A glass of water?
- Yes.

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.080
Remember the shower
we'd on Friday?

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.080
They'd to play against
East Bengal.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.080
I had gone to watch.

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.360
I think it was 5 or 5 past,
when the shower came.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.560
And m why God. It just kept pouring
and pouring and pouring.

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.640
I got completely soaked.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.080
Influenza?

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.160
Well, yes, but such high fever.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.480
Yes. 104 on Sunday.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.240
She wept like a child.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.320
Oh mom.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.360
But you're all right now?
- Yes.

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.840
I missed Jennifer's party and...

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.480
I was so scared. I thought I'd
pneumonia or something.

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.240
Try it?

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.000
And now I've to do all your work.
- What work?

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:33.760
Didn't you schedule a demonstration
today? Isn't this Thursday?

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.280
Oh my God. This is a goner.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.320
And where was it yesterday?

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.400
Short street.

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.560
Something vendor. That Parsi lady.

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.040
Oh, Aarti. I am so sorry.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:49.320
Don't say sorry. Say thank you.
You'll get the commission.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.760
Alright.

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.280
I will give you 5% of my 5%. Okay?

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.040
And don't you've a sales
report to turn in?

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.240
It's ready. It's in my bag.

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.760
Here.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.480
I will bring it in tomorrow.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.200
You'll be in tomorrow?

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.840
I must.
I haven't got my wages yet, damn it.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.560
They came for the lunch
this morning...

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.200
and I told them to come on Saturday.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.640
That's alright, mom.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720
Here.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:20.960
What's that?

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.120
Your pay...

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.040
Oh, Aarti. Thank you so much.

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.440
Here, sign for it.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.880
How sweet of you!

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.600
Sign it.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.960
Try and come in tomorrow.

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.960
Alright. Turn in the sales report
yourself. The boss will be happy.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.960
Okay, I will think I will do that.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.200
I'll be going.
- All right.

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.840
Thanks for coming.

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.760
Say good-bye to your mother for me.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:50.200
Wait a minute.
I've got something for you.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.280
5% of my 5%. Take it.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.280
Take them.
I don't use them. I got a new pair.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.600
No.
- Take it. Put them on.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:10.920
There.

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.680
That's their advantage.

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.320
The problem is the population.

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.680
And the solution is family planning.

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.200
It's better be a bachelor.

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560
Right.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.520
1000 years.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.360
He is telling the truth.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.720
That's fine.

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.160
You thought I was just out shopping?

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.920
Naturally.
That was my first impression.

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.160
Sit down.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.200
What will you have?

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.760
Tea.
- Nothing else?

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.040
Two teas, please.

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.840
So you're a salesgirl, eh?

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.760
Don't laugh. It's a good job.

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.920
And we make a good product.
- Is that so?

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.600
Look.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:00.680
You've to buy one.
- What? It's compulsory?

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.360
Why not?

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.520
Since you're the husband
of a rich friend.

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.240
Autonit.

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.800
For your wife, of course.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.840
Knitting machine.
Washing machine. Okay?

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.080
Soon women will have no
work to do at all.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.080
How is Shipra?

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.280
You still haven't come by our place.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.400
And I've yet to meet your husband.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.520
I hardly see him myself.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.120
Really? Why?

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.960
He's addicted to his work.

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.960
He works a 12-hour day.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.920
He's gone by 8:00 a.m.
And isn't home till 8:00 p.m.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.040
Is he an employee,
or is it his own business?

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.040
His own business.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.640
Import-export.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.480
He's responsible for everything.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:10.800
Set it up all by himself too.
- Very good.

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.280
I insisted on working just for fun.

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.320
Otherwise he wouldn't have let me.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.640
If you work,
people will say I don't make enough.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.920
I see.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:27.960
I said, why?

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.160
Everyone knows how much you make.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.120
He finally said, all right,
but just for six months.

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.640
There's just one month left.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.320
Then I'll quit.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.440
My sense of direction is a bit weak.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.160
Take a right here.
- Right.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.320
All right.

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.440
Especially the Kalighat area.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:15.920
I've put you to a lot of trouble.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.640
When I see that the streetcars
aren't running...

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.480
I give a lift to anyone
I see on the road.

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.640
To tell you the truth...

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.960
when I see the plight
of pedestrians...

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.240
I feel very guilty sometimes.

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.120
I'd quite an argument about
this with my wife.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.480
Why?

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.640
She said I mustn't stop for everyone
I see in the street.

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.280
When I asked why, she said...

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.480
How do you know they're not
carrying infectious germs?

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.000
Disinfect the car or
I won't ride in it.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.440
She's crazy.

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:06.680
Please forgive my saying so,
Mrs. Mazumdar...

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.960
but women get these obsessions.

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:12.200
She's obsessed with germs.

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.120
Three bottles of
sanitizers per month.

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.320
Bhombol...

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:31.360
did Aarti say she'd be late?

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.360
No, she didn't say anything to me.

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.600
She's never been this late.

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.800
There's a car outside. Go and see.

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.120
Bhombol.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:15.680
Bhombol, are you there?

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:23.240
God!

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:25.400
What happened?

01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.960
What happened?

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:41.280
Please lie down slowly, sir.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:47.720
Oh.

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.120
What happened?

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.840
Don't be upset.
It's nothing to worry about.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.520
He felt a bit sick,
so he came to my office.

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.760
He got dizzy on the stairs and fell.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.560
He walked a lot in the sun...

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.000
and has blood pressure problems too.

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.320
But there's no need to worry.

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.800
I've written him a prescription...

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.600
and he must have complete rest.

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:25.080
Look after him, all right?

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.880
I keep telling you not
to go out so much.

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:31.360
Have a seat.
- No, I have to rush.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.440
Sir, I'll be leaving now.

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.280
Don't behave like a little child,
all right?

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.680
I see.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.480
Remember, complete bed rest.

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.680
I'm a former pupil of his.

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.800
I haven't seen him in 25 years.
Right, sir?

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:52.080
I'm afraid the circumstances
weren't...

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.360
I have to be going.

01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.760
May I have a word?

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:12.800
I'm not asking for payment...

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.080
but there's something
I've to tell you.

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.920
I've a feeling you're
all neglecting him.

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.680
Otherwise,
with a grown son like you...

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.760
there's no reason for him...

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.160
to be out searching for
a doctor on his own.

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.680
I know it's none of my business,
but I'd to tell you.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.400
Well, I'll be going.

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.480
Horne.

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.840
No, wait.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.960
I'd never have found this
place on my own.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:20.480
Come.

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.200
Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:25.880
Would you like to...

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.240
Not today.

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.920
Some other time,
if I can remember the way.

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:44.400
What happened?

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.920
Is that Aarti?

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:51.600
I've warned him so often about
wandering the streets...

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:53.480
but he never listens.

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.440
What if you'd hurt your
head or something?

01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.200
My glasses broke.

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.120
The ones Pranab gave me.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:05.480
What happened?

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:08.240
On his way to see a doctor,
he felt dizzy and fell.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.080
Good heavens!

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:13.760
How are you now, Baba?

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:19.200
I've sinned too much
to die just yet.

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.120
Don't say that, Baba.

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.720
I feel no pain physically...

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.880
but my thoughts...

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:31.360
are very disturbed.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.000
Try not to talk too much.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.360
I said bad things about you, Aarti.

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.720
I said...

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:44.360
you'd changed.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.160
But you know what I did?

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.480
I went around to my pupils...

01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.520
and spoke ill of my own son.

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:01.800
I said...

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.240
he wasn't looking after me...

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:07.080
that you look after me.

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.160
Now you must decide my punishment,
Aarti.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.280
Whatever it is...

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.240
I'll accept it.

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.400
You know your punishment?

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.600
You've to take all your
medications...

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.200
and I'll administer them.

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.960
You're too lenient, daughter-in-law.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:42.200
He will never make a good teacher.

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:44.240
He will never.

01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.360
Listen...

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.480
I've only been late
the last few days.

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.200
It doesn't happen every day,
does it?

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:26.720
No.

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.600
You always have the Austin.

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.400
It's just in the shop
for a few days.

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:37.840
No, why?
I'll send the other car for you.

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:41.240
In an hour.

01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:44.920
Do your shopping then come
by my office around 5:30.

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.960
Yes, my office.

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.840
Not even one minute. Promise.

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.400
All right. But...

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.680
How many busy executives...

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.480
would do so much for their wives?

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.160
Okay.

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.600
I've come...

01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:26.960
I recognize you.
Aren't you Aarti Debt's husband?

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.080
Unless I'm very much mistaken.

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.800
Yes, but...

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:38.200
There was a snapshot of you
in your wife's purse.

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:42.160
It fell out when she took
out a sales report.

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:45.720
It was taken at the zoo,
in front of a camel...

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:48.120
No, a giraffe.
- Giraffe - that's it!

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:50.240
Your memory is really...
- Not at all.

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.960
I saw the name Mazumdar
on my schedule...

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:56.120
and I've heard your
voice on the phone.

01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:00.320
I imagine Aarti's out right now.

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:04.280
Yes, they leave by 10:30.
If you'd come a bit earlier...

02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.800
Then I'll be going.
- No, please don't.

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.560
A tea, please.

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.600
What's the hurry?
You're free these days, right?

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.120
Well, yes...

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.960
You're originally from Pabna.

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.240
You see, I keep abreast of things.

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.560
What village?

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.240
The town of Pabna itself.

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.240
I'm from Sirajganj.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.400
We're birds of a feather.

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.280
Your office is very nice.

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.920
How's your wife enjoying the job?

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:52.240
She enjoys it,
but it's causing a bit of strain.

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.720
But that's only recently.
- She gets home quite late.

02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.600
You see, the thing is...

02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.480
she has this Anglo-Indian colleague.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.280
I shouldn't say this...

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:06.160
but our ex-rulers left
behind quite a clan!

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.280
The girl's been absent for a
few days. Says she's sick.

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.080
The truth may be something
else entirely.

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:16.800
But your wife's had to take
on her workload too.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:20.200
Otherwise there'd be no question
of overstraining.

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:24.600
But I must say one
thing about her...

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.280
Of course,
there's no need to tell you.

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.040
After all you know her
much better than I do.

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:37.240
But she is very efficient.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.920
The day of your mishap...

02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.440
she immediately pressured
me for a raise.

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.440
In that sense she's certainly
a bit impulsive...

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.120
but I couldn't refuse her.

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.760
With a conscientious worker...

02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:57.720
you sometimes have to meet
their additional demands.

02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:00.520
At least,
that's the principle I thought.

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:02.840
Please.

02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:11.040
Have you ever thought about
a husband and wife...

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.440
working in the same office?

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.120
No, I can't say
- - I have...

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.600
and I don't approve.

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.520
So if I'm to do anything for you...

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.560
it has to be somewhere else.

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.640
I didn't come here for a job.

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:32.720
Don't you need a job?

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.040
Yes, of course.

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:40.120
Then where's the problem?

02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.680
That's very kind of you.

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:46.280
This isn't about kindness, sir.

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:49.080
I have a job and you don't.

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:53.920
It so happens I might have some
influence that you don't.

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:57.360
The most important thing...

02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.040
is that we're both from Pabna.

02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:01.280
Couldn't be simpler.

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.600
Do one thing for me.

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:18.440
Come see me again this
evening around 5:00.

02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:20.040
Would that be a problem?
- No.

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.680
In the meantime,
I'll make a few calls, okay?

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.440
Let's go.

02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:28.400
Should I tell your wife you came by?

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:30.840
No, you needn't tell her.

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.920
Good afternoon, sir.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.600
I brought these.
- Sit down.

02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.840
I want to talk to you.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.320
I don't want to hear another
word from you.

02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:24.400
Edith?

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:30.520
What's going on?

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.240
Here. Read this.

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.520
What am I going to tell Phil?

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.600
He fired you?

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.520
You saw me? You came to my house.

02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:49.040
You saw I was ill.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.200
He doesn't believe you?

02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:54.080
No. He thinks I was having fun.

02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:56.400
That dirty filthy mind. Son of a...

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:05.960
Here.

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.640
What did you say to Edith?

02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:43.800
What did you say to Edith?

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:53.120
Did you insult her...

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.560
or say something about
her character?

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:05.760
Did you come to fight with me
about that Anglo-Indian girl?

02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.040
What did you say to Edith?

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.640
Don't get so excited, Mrs. Mazumdar.

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:19.840
You didn't insult her?

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.320
Whether I did or not...

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.160
I don't have to tell you,
Mrs. Mazumdar.

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.680
You know nothing about her...

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.760
and still you insulted her?

02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:40.520
You dismissed her?

02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:45.800
Look, Mrs. Mazumdar...

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.280
what I do or what I tell...

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:54.560
employees in my office...

02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:58.360
It's my business. And mine alone.

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:01.720
Edith may be your employee...

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.440
but I've worked with her...

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.080
for four months.

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.560
She's my friend.

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:13.760
I know her. I've been to her house.

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:17.640
I saw with my own eyes
that she was sick.

02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:24.360
I don't know how friendly
you're with Miss Simmons.

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:31.520
But may I ask you...

02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:33.800
how much you know...

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:36.560
about Anglo-Indian girls?

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.840
I don't know any other
Anglo-Indian girls...

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.880
but I do know Edith.

02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:45.040
And I can tell you...

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:50.280
she doesn't deserve to be insulted.

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:51.840
I didn't insult her!

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:56.960
She got what she deserved.

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:02.120
The day I realized that a Bengali
girl, meaning you...

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:08.680
Why can't you understand I
fired her for your sake?

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:12.760
When I realized you could handle
her job, I decided to fire her.

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:16.120
Only my sense of obligation
kept her here this long.

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.680
Why are you interfering?
What do you gain?

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.560
You're jeopardizing
your own position.

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.440
Would your friend do
the same for you?

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:35.080
You've gone mad.

02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:42.320
You've no right to say anything
about her character...

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.920
especially when it isn't true.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.400
It's injustice, and it's wrong.

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:51.960
Mrs. Mazumdar...

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:54.320
your words...

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:57.040
would be more apt coming from
my side of this desk...

02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.480
not yours.

02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:02.120
You're overstepping your bounds.

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.200
I think...

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:11.000
you should apologize to her.

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:16.440
Will you do that?

02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:21.360
Will you?

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.400
Mrs. Mazumdar,
you don't understand that...

02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.160
I am busy now.

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.560
You don't understand...

02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.800
that your attitude could've
serious consequences.

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.840
You won't apologize?

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:51.920
If you lose your job, what then?

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.320
Then...

02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.880
I'd be very happy...

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.480
Here.
- What's that?

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:11.120
My resignation. Change the date.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.280
Mrs. Mazumdar.

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:55.040
Aarti.

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:01.080
What's going on?

02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.200
What's going on?

02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.160
Don't be angry.
Don't misunderstand me.

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.240
Everyone else will misunderstand.
Don't you too.

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:31.120
But what happened?

02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:34.360
I quit my job...

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:36.960
You quit?

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:42.920
Mr. Himangshu fired
Edith for no reason.

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.360
She'd done nothing wrong,
but he wouldn't listen.

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:52.600
Now she can't get married.

02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.800
I felt so bad for her.

02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:59.640
It seemed like such a gross
injustice that I...

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:07.760
You're angry.

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.120
I can tell you're angry.

02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:14.480
Who can I turn to now?

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:19.280
Aarti...

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.960
Don't cry.

02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:24.760
I'm not angry, you hear?

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:27.040
I'm not angry...

02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:30.280
though I can't be too happy either.

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.280
You know our situation.

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:35.120
I know. I made a big mistake.

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:36.920
Don't say that.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.280
Listen to me.

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.880
You stood up to injustice.
Was that wrong?

02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:45.680
I could never have
done what you did.

02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:47.280
I wouldn't have had the courage.

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.720
Earning our daily bread
has made us cowards.

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:54.880
But you weren't a coward.
Is that a small achievement?

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.960
Why should I be angry with you?

02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:01.200
I feel scared. Very scared.

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:03.520
Why? I'm by your side.

02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:12.840
You're by my side?
- Where else?

02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:18.200
You moved so far away from me.

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:19.840
Don't go any further.

02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:22.960
Aarti, don't cry.

02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:25.640
This is the time to be strong.

02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:27.800
How will we manage
if you break down?

02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.400
Don't cry.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.120
Aarti.

02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:48.040
Such a big city.

02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:50.840
So many different jobs.

02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:56.360
Surely one of us can find a job.

02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.600
Let's try.

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:02.520
I'm sure we both will.

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:05.640
You know...

02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:08.480
even facing this difficult moment...

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.160
not knowing what fate
has in store...

02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:16.280
I feel very happy.

02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.440
You're not scared anymore?

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.280
Feel.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:29.480
Shall we?
- Yes.
