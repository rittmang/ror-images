WEBVTT

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.167
THE IMPOSTER PRINCE

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:35.292
- Praise be to God.
- May God be praised.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:25.041
<i>This is how Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri
passed away.</i>

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:30.082
<i>And he was cremated on the morning
of May 9th, 1909.</i>

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.792
<i>That's all, Your Honour.</i>

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.583
Prosecution may proceed now.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.582
Thank you, Your Honour.

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:43.499
As the the first witness,
I would like to call upon a corpse.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.291
The corpse that was allegedly cremated
24 years ago on the 9th of May, 1909.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:53.208
The name of the corpse is
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:40.542
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:51.792
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:58.124
<i>Forget all your doubts in
the rhythm of the music</i>

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:00.916
<i>The door is open, no more delay</i>

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:08.917
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:20.167
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.457
<i>The path of the morning is adorned
with the fragrance of the flowers</i>

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:06.124
<i>The path of the morning is adorned
with the fragrance of the flowers</i>

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:14.125
<i>Separation is a vacation
On the path of love</i>

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:20.208
<i>Walk that path...</i>

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:29.250
<i>Walk that path and come to me,
my beloved, my beautiful</i>

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:43.417
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:54.958
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:03.083
Set up the chess board.

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:06.667
Black or white?

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:12.667
I have no other choice... So, white.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:22.083
Last time, I've only taken...
I couldn't give anything back.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.208
Please play properly this time.

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.042
When did he go to sleep?

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.667
He called me after that woman left.

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.542
Kadambari?

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.583
Who else?

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.833
That dirty wench!

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:28.750
I heard my brother has built her
a mansion nearby...

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:33.042
You've heard right, ma'am.

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:40.000
Is this the fate of the royals then, Anand?

00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:43.666
Even with people like us
around who love him...

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:47.208
There'll be hundreds
who will leech him off.

00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:50.458
What can we do, ma'am?

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:57.667
- I love him more than my own brother...
- That's enough!

00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:00.832
You may leave now.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.667
I'll stay with my brother.

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:45.667
What's the matter?

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:49.708
Early in the morning...

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.208
What is it, Minu?

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958
What is this?

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:04.541
Something religious?

00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:08.583
It's nothing.
At least, nothing important.

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:22.083
Oh no... I completely forgot.

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:26.417
What do you want?
Just name it.

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:36.375
Tell me.

00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:48.125
I want you to stop drinking.
Stop drinking.

00:11:55.042 --> 00:12:01.792
I can consider it if you wake me up
with sweet curd every morning.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.000
Brother...

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:24.833
Why is the life line
on your palm so strange?

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:31.042
See, it's split in the middle.

00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:42.624
Because I play two roles in my life.

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:43.917
What?

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:52.750
First, a feudal lord who loves women and
alcohol... Loves to make the most of life.

00:12:56.625 --> 00:13:04.625
And second, a feudal lord who takes care of
and protects his subjects, like a guardian.

00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:27.333
Are you on your period?

00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:33.500
I asked are you on your period?

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.083
Well then...

00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.832
Come to my room at 8 o'clock.

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:43.875
Anthony will make the arrangements.

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:53.457
Did you call for me?

00:13:53.458 --> 00:14:00.457
Mahen, do you know that the area of
the Bikrampur estate is 579 square miles?

00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:03.541
And the annual income of the estate
is Rs. 10 lakhs.

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:10.332
Did you know that this comes
from 2274 villages and 5 lakh people?

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:17.916
They believe that their landlord is spending
all his time for the welfare of his subjects.

00:14:17.917 --> 00:14:19.374
Not with some prostitute.

00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:22.082
That's enough.

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:26.541
The way you're responsible for us.

00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:28.624
You've responsibilty
towards the estate too.

00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:32.832
- When elder brother is there...
- You're getting married next month.

00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:36.541
Impossible! I've no intentions
of playing with some kid.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:40.874
I'd rather get a hold of the estate
from the manager.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:48.875
When your father left us
at such a young age...

00:14:49.583 --> 00:14:53.624
We were extremely helpless.

00:14:53.625 --> 00:15:01.625
Only I know how your mother
has brought you up.

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:04.874
She has taken care of the household.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:10.457
She gave Kaliprasanna a tough fight
to keep the estate in the family.

00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:15.292
You don't have to do it for anyone else.
Please do it for me, your grandmother.

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:21.374
You and Minu always take advantage
of my love for you.

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:26.250
It's good to know that
I'm not in that list.

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.666
My labour pain was probably
just a disease.

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:31.374
Mother, you know that's not what I meant.

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:35.749
We speak so rarely, it's difficult for me
to understand.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.207
Please shed some tears for me
when I am gone.

00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:42.374
Otherwise, people might think bad of you.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:46.207
Daughter-in-law, can't
you control yourself?

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:47.999
Talking to you is a task...

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.916
About your marriage...

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:54.999
This marriage is not just about you.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.958
It's also because the estate needs an heir.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:03.624
The British are just waiting
to pounce on the estate.

00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:08.750
And the Court of Wards...
closing in like the vultures.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.375
- Oh yes, Meyers. Sit.
- Thank you, sir.

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:49.916
I trust you've been discreet.

00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:53.416
Yes, my lord. They suspect nothing.
Not yet, at least.

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:57.416
Good but you also know that it's only a
matter of time before they do suspect and...

00:16:57.417 --> 00:17:00.457
When they do, they'll remove you
from your post.

00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:02.166
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:05.416
Good because it's then
that we will move in.

00:17:05.417 --> 00:17:09.082
With your official letter of complaint,
detailing among other things...

00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:13.625
corruption, interference,
mismanagement, money laundering...

00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:16.546
This is the first step
towards the Court of Wards

00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:19.457
taking over entire
possession of the estate.

00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:22.791
- Did you obtain the documents I requested?
- Yes, sir.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.750
Show them to me.

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:29.916
Thank you.

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:32.332
Ah yes! Yes, yes! Very good!

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:35.250
But sir what about the princes?

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:39.541
Oh the prodigal princes!
Yes, well...

00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:45.583
In lieu of their share of their erstwhile
estate, they'll receive a fixed income.

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.624
A monthly payment.

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:52.332
Just enough to keep the people
and their nationalistic outrage at bay.

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:55.124
Yes, sir. Despite all
his feudal excesses...

00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:58.207
The kind of popularity that
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri enjoys...

00:17:58.208 --> 00:18:03.417
amongst the common people of his estate
is unbelievable.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.207
Yes, I'm aware of it.

00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:08.666
But I'm also aware of how he and
his brothers are carrying on.

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:10.799
I wouldn't be surprised if
the court ultimatel

00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:13.957
had to give their pensions
to three widows instead.

00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.207
And will the estate pass
over to Her Majesty, then?

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:18.542
Well, that is the idea.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:24.458
But to tell you for sure, I'd have to go
very closely over this documentation.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.874
Always remember, Meyers...

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:31.457
In the British empire,
whether you annexe, colonise,

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:34.166
whether you intrude
or take over by force...

00:18:34.167 --> 00:18:36.375
It's the paperwork that's most important.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:19:02.167
<i>How will I fetch the water now, mate?</i>

00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:19.208
<i>My lover awaits at the river bank</i>

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:35.125
<i>My lover awaits at the river bank</i>

00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:45.875
<i>How will I fetch the water now, mate?</i>

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:12.500
<i>I've given up all my modesty, mate</i>

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.707
<i>I've given up all my modesty, mate</i>

00:20:25.708 --> 00:20:33.708
<i>I smile and embrace him</i>

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:49.708
<i>How will I fetch the water now, mate?</i>

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.917
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:22:29.875 --> 00:22:35.125
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:39.332
Isn't Phoolmala looking very thin?

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:41.582
Almost skeletal, sir.

00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:44.749
Are you not feeding her right, Dilawar?

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.041
She is eating quite well, sir.

00:22:48.042 --> 00:22:51.874
I think she missed you.

00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:53.083
Phoolmala.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.707
Where's the list, Birendra?

00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:04.666
There are 17 meritorious students, my lord.
I've already spoken to their parents.

00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:05.749
Great!

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.666
Make arrangements to send them
to Calcutta for further studies.

00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:08.831
Yes, my lord.

00:23:08.856 --> 00:23:09.816
- And Billu?
- Yes, sir...

00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:13.966
What happened to the fathers of the girls?

00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:15.629
They are coming tomorrow, my lord.

00:23:15.654 --> 00:23:18.372
- Make sure we have some cash.
- Yes, sir.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:19.667
And listen.

00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:25.792
Send some relief to the Muslim
fishing village that got burnt down.

00:23:25.817 --> 00:23:28.042
Let's go, Phoolmala.

00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:42.792
- Let's go.
- Watch out!

00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:47.416
Move... Let me see...

00:23:47.417 --> 00:23:49.875
My lord, careful...

00:23:53.207 --> 00:23:55.167
Please be careful.

00:23:59.754 --> 00:24:02.347
Please be careful
with your foot, my lord.

00:24:02.372 --> 00:24:04.375
Please take it easy, my lord.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.015
It's okay.
You may leave.

00:24:24.528 --> 00:24:26.237
Who are you?

00:24:27.422 --> 00:24:29.546
Who are you?

00:24:29.574 --> 00:24:33.708
Why are you crying?
Who are you?

00:24:35.542 --> 00:24:37.874
- Chandraboti...
- What?

00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:40.249
Mrs. Chandraboti Devi...

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.083
What are you doing in my room?

00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:47.917
I'm your wife...

00:24:49.058 --> 00:24:50.667
Oh...

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.250
Right... Right...

00:24:56.074 --> 00:24:59.933
I think I heard
that I got married.

00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:09.082
How do you like it here?

00:25:10.449 --> 00:25:15.675
I... I miss home.

00:25:19.465 --> 00:25:23.504
What happened to your foot?

00:25:24.215 --> 00:25:27.500
It's just a small scratch.

00:25:27.863 --> 00:25:34.370
- I'll make arrangements for you to go home...
- No, no...

00:25:34.394 --> 00:25:37.401
I want to stay with you.

00:25:45.112 --> 00:25:46.784
Okay.

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:50.987
What did you say your name is?

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:55.166
Mrs. Chandraboti Devi.

00:25:55.167 --> 00:25:57.333
Chandraboti...

00:25:58.706 --> 00:26:01.708
Listen, Chandraboti...

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:06.011
I'm not a very good person.

00:26:09.833 --> 00:26:18.464
I like to spend my time with friends,
music, alcohol, food, women etc.

00:26:22.636 --> 00:26:27.433
I mean women... Not little girls okay...

00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:32.815
I like mature women not kids.

00:26:35.104 --> 00:26:38.222
I don't know how much time
I'll have for you.

00:26:38.776 --> 00:26:41.583
There are lots of servants.

00:26:42.222 --> 00:26:46.229
My brothers' wives...
My mother is also there.

00:26:46.292 --> 00:26:49.620
Everything you need
and want will be available.

00:26:51.073 --> 00:26:54.383
You have an elder brother, right?

00:26:54.524 --> 00:27:00.875
Ask him to come and stay here.
I'll take care of it.

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:02.583
Okay?

00:27:04.488 --> 00:27:06.113
What is it?

00:27:14.422 --> 00:27:19.899
Okay fine...
I'll come to you when I can.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.641
I'll try to spend time with you.

00:27:26.447 --> 00:27:30.727
But I can also disappear for days.

00:27:31.825 --> 00:27:32.825
Okay?

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:38.041
How many days?

00:27:38.042 --> 00:27:41.876
How many days?

00:27:41.901 --> 00:27:45.667
Might be years.

00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:29.854
Where is Mahendra?

00:28:29.879 --> 00:28:32.970
Tell him that the British
have sent a request from Calcutta.

00:28:32.995 --> 00:28:37.587
Before he returns to London, Lord Kitchener
wants to go on a safari to hunt tigers.

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:39.767
We'll have to make all the arrangements.

00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:42.673
Mahendra knows where all
the hunting gear is.

00:28:42.698 --> 00:28:45.478
But where is he?

00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:48.833
- Where is he?
- In the dance hall, sir.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.167
At this odd hour?

00:28:59.275 --> 00:29:07.417
<i>My tears, they don't dry</i>

00:29:12.974 --> 00:29:20.990
<i>My tears, they don't dry</i>

00:29:21.015 --> 00:29:29.292
<i>How can I put kohl on my eyes?</i>

00:29:34.912 --> 00:29:43.000
<i>I can barely see my lover's face</i>

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:57.167
<i>How will I wish misfortune away?</i>

00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:07.958
<i>My tears, they don't dry</i>

00:30:08.417 --> 00:30:13.078
You didn't attend
Lord Kitchener's dinner reception?

00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:15.042
No, Satya...

00:30:15.083 --> 00:30:18.208
I don't like the British
or their etiquette.

00:30:18.312 --> 00:30:21.167
And I don't want to learn it either.

00:30:21.703 --> 00:30:24.458
I was supposed to make arrangements
for the hunt.

00:30:24.742 --> 00:30:29.250
That's why I am looking for a tiger.
That's all.

00:30:29.726 --> 00:30:31.929
Tell me, how is your sister?

00:30:31.954 --> 00:30:33.583
She is well.

00:30:34.007 --> 00:30:38.292
She feels depressed sometimes
when you're not around.

00:30:38.617 --> 00:30:42.351
That is the life of a queen, Satya.

00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:43.570
Loneliness...

00:30:43.595 --> 00:30:46.917
Yes, yes... I understand.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.968
The king has many responsibilties.

00:30:48.993 --> 00:30:53.070
A huge estate, subjects, official duty.

00:30:53.095 --> 00:30:55.666
She understands it too.

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:58.417
And you've taken care of everything.

00:30:58.984 --> 00:31:02.292
There's only thing that troubles me
as her brother.

00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:04.458
What is that?

00:31:04.483 --> 00:31:07.733
This world is very ruthless, my lord.

00:31:08.823 --> 00:31:12.031
I know how much you love Chandra.

00:31:12.597 --> 00:31:14.597
But after you're gone...

00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:17.500
May you live till 100...

00:31:17.554 --> 00:31:19.917
But if something happens to you.

00:31:20.062 --> 00:31:22.957
Then my sister will be all alone.

00:31:22.958 --> 00:31:26.749
- And the others...
- What about the others?

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.917
Greed can make good people
do evil things.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.273
Not my place to say it...

00:31:33.298 --> 00:31:36.937
The others in your family
are not very fond of Chandra.

00:31:36.962 --> 00:31:38.875
They don't like me either.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.542
We come from a poor family.

00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:45.500
I don't know what will happen to us
when you're not watching over us.

00:31:45.546 --> 00:31:48.546
I had no idea about this, Satya.

00:31:48.927 --> 00:31:50.786
- What is your suggestion?
- Nothing much...

00:31:50.811 --> 00:31:53.497
A life insurance policy.

00:31:53.848 --> 00:31:57.208
God forbid, something happens to you...

00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:00.750
Chandra won't be helpless.

00:32:00.841 --> 00:32:03.559
I know a good insurance company
in Calcutta...

00:32:19.917 --> 00:32:21.750
Stop... Stop... Stop...

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.542
Be careful...
don't kill the tiger.

00:32:33.929 --> 00:32:36.083
Only shoot to injure.

00:32:37.172 --> 00:32:40.297
So that it's movement is restricted.

00:32:40.322 --> 00:32:42.917
And the Englishman can find it easily.

00:32:48.992 --> 00:32:50.667
To your right, my lord!

00:33:07.864 --> 00:33:11.542
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine...

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.926
What were you saying?

00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:18.168
Which insurance company in Calcutta?

00:33:18.512 --> 00:33:19.958
What?

00:33:51.832 --> 00:33:52.958
Please come.

00:33:53.157 --> 00:33:55.083
We're here, my lord.

00:34:02.928 --> 00:34:05.208
Who is the policy holder?

00:34:05.959 --> 00:34:09.708
Would you like to come with me, sir,
for the medical examination?

00:34:09.732 --> 00:34:10.624
Huh?

00:34:10.625 --> 00:34:13.042
Do you follow English, sir?

00:34:13.458 --> 00:34:15.000
No English.

00:34:15.025 --> 00:34:18.207
Well, I need to ask some questions...

00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:21.419
and check you
as part of the medical process.

00:34:21.444 --> 00:34:24.137
I guess we'll need an interpreter...
Mr. Sen! Mr. Sen!

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:26.459
He is the medical examiner
from the insurance company.

00:34:26.484 --> 00:34:27.708
Just a routine check up.

00:34:27.917 --> 00:34:30.833
Dr. Caddy? Dr. Caddy?

00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.417
He's all yours now.

00:34:33.236 --> 00:34:35.792
- Come with me, sir.
- Please come.

00:34:41.895 --> 00:34:42.895
This way please.

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:50.458
Satya, go back to Bikrampur.
I'll stay here for a few more days.

00:34:51.083 --> 00:34:55.542
I stripped naked today.
What was the result?

00:34:55.567 --> 00:34:59.165
An old English doctor poked me
and wrote some things down.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.751
Let's see if doing it again
yields more exciting results.

00:35:02.776 --> 00:35:05.625
- But sir...
- Satya...

00:35:06.845 --> 00:35:10.208
I've already made up my mind.

00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:11.907
- Anthony...
- Yes, my lord.

00:35:11.932 --> 00:35:16.792
I've heard many enchanting stories
about the beautiful women of Calcutta.

00:35:17.618 --> 00:35:22.314
Brand new faces, fresh bodies...
Let's experiment.

00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:20.625
<i>Where beauty is lit up by the moonlight</i>

00:36:24.042 --> 00:36:32.042
<i>The forehead is adorned by vermillion</i>

00:36:33.708 --> 00:36:41.708
<i>Bring that beauty</i>

00:36:42.175 --> 00:36:50.458
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:36:53.324 --> 00:37:01.417
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:20.250
Mother's letter.

00:37:27.321 --> 00:37:29.417
Did he come home last night?

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.305
No.

00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:40.625
Don't you feel angry, Chandra?

00:37:42.595 --> 00:37:45.958
Don't you feel rage?

00:37:48.149 --> 00:37:51.082
Will you still tolerate this?

00:37:51.083 --> 00:37:54.958
Is this why you studied
at the best school in Calcutta?

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.291
His anaemic wife suffers
and he's out with hookers...

00:38:00.292 --> 00:38:03.266
- For he's a man...
- Destiny, brother.

00:38:03.501 --> 00:38:05.149
Let it be.

00:38:11.423 --> 00:38:15.524
Do you know what Bikrampur was called
during the Mahabharata era?

00:38:18.167 --> 00:38:20.167
Chhedi.

00:38:20.782 --> 00:38:23.821
And who was the king of Chhedi?

00:38:24.792 --> 00:38:26.875
Shishupal.

00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:30.563
Shishupal... whose 100th mistake
was his last.

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:52.417
I forgot to tell you.

00:38:52.937 --> 00:38:55.417
A letter has come for you.

00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:59.250
- When?
- Two days back.

00:39:00.541 --> 00:39:02.167
One moment.

00:39:21.807 --> 00:39:23.073
Here you go.

00:40:53.906 --> 00:40:56.328
What are you doing here by yourself?

00:40:57.506 --> 00:40:59.625
Just like that...

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.946
You look very worried.

00:41:04.043 --> 00:41:11.836
I'm a little worried
about his lordship's health.

00:41:12.135 --> 00:41:15.292
Can you share your concerns
with me?

00:41:16.491 --> 00:41:18.958
Yes...

00:41:20.299 --> 00:41:26.953
What I've diagnosed is...

00:41:28.706 --> 00:41:31.455
His hands, feet and nose...

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.410
- Yes, the marks...
- Those are gummatous ulcers.

00:41:37.122 --> 00:41:39.486
I think...

00:41:41.022 --> 00:41:44.458
- it's syphilis.
- Syphilis?

00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:50.390
- Is it worse than TB or cholera?
- It's fatal.

00:41:55.364 --> 00:41:59.349
Syphilis is the most dangerous
venereal disease.

00:41:59.876 --> 00:42:05.638
It warrants the best medical attention
and a lot of rest.

00:42:05.663 --> 00:42:07.708
- Or else...
- Or else?

00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:12.122
It could cost him his life.

00:42:12.402 --> 00:42:16.543
If his condition worsens then...

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:23.588
He'll start losing his hair
and his skin will rot and then...

00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:26.375
Do you like it here, Ashwini?

00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:28.750
What?

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.249
This life? This mansion?

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.708
Do you like this kind of life?

00:42:45.007 --> 00:42:47.247
- Yes...
- Really?

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.832
They're a little ill mannered
and fickle minded...

00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:55.873
Sometimes, they'll be kind
and generous...

00:42:55.898 --> 00:42:58.966
And at other times,
they can treat people like dirt.

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:03.152
All that is tolerable...

00:43:03.177 --> 00:43:11.250
My father was this family's
house physician.

00:43:12.052 --> 00:43:16.582
But the way they've treated
my father in public...

00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:19.161
I feel really bad.

00:43:19.233 --> 00:43:20.743
But what can I do?

00:43:20.768 --> 00:43:25.027
They're paying
for my medical studies.

00:43:27.234 --> 00:43:34.226
- They've given me a home...
- Not for long.

00:43:36.037 --> 00:43:37.033
Pardon?

00:43:37.058 --> 00:43:40.419
This place you call home...
It won't be there for long.

00:43:40.764 --> 00:43:44.748
The British are waiting
to take over Bikrampur.

00:43:44.773 --> 00:43:48.218
Thanks to Mr. Rankin and Mr. Meyers,
even though the princes are alive...

00:43:48.243 --> 00:43:51.408
the Bikrampur estate is already governed
by the Court of Wards.

00:43:51.433 --> 00:43:55.269
What will happen
when the princes die?

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.264
But why will they die so soon?

00:44:04.156 --> 00:44:06.208
Look at their lifestyle.

00:44:06.545 --> 00:44:13.251
Alcohol, hunting, riding, eating habits,
women, syphilis...

00:44:18.167 --> 00:44:22.020
- Which can be treated...
- Ashwini...

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:26.193
His lordship is ill.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.666
Can we take him somewhere
to recuperate?

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:34.221
- But in his condition...
- Exactly because of that...

00:44:34.696 --> 00:44:41.434
To make his health better if we can
take him somewhere with fresh air...

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.883
Where should we take him?

00:44:52.167 --> 00:44:54.019
Darjeeling?

00:44:54.077 --> 00:44:55.633
Malati...

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.542
Yes, my lord... Darjeeling.

00:45:03.187 --> 00:45:09.833
You'll heal much faster
in unpolluted Darjeeling.

00:45:10.427 --> 00:45:12.792
You hardly get any rest here.

00:45:13.304 --> 00:45:15.458
You'll get the rest you need.

00:45:15.583 --> 00:45:17.452
I understand that the mountain air
is good for me.

00:45:17.477 --> 00:45:19.625
But what about the mountain girls?

00:45:20.166 --> 00:45:21.325
Can you arrange for that?

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.750
- My lord...
- Satya...

00:45:25.958 --> 00:45:28.167
- Doctor...
- Yes, my lord...

00:45:28.333 --> 00:45:31.167
The king's body will have wounds...

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.000
It'll have injuries and diseases too...

00:45:36.254 --> 00:45:39.583
The wounds are medals won
at battle.

00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:45.557
The injuries are titles earned
for running the estate.

00:45:45.582 --> 00:45:46.918
And the diseases...

00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:53.523
If he can sustain a horde of harmful relatives

00:45:53.548 --> 00:45:55.338
and disloyal subjects on the estate...

00:45:55.363 --> 00:46:00.622
then he can sustain a few germs
in his body too.

00:46:00.648 --> 00:46:02.144
What do you think, Satya?

00:46:02.145 --> 00:46:04.395
Well said, my lord!

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:07.354
But your body is not yours alone.

00:46:07.674 --> 00:46:09.312
It belongs to us too.

00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:12.041
We have rights over it.

00:46:12.583 --> 00:46:15.124
The entire estate is praying for you
to get better.

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:21.291
Your elder brother
is not keeping very well.

00:46:22.416 --> 00:46:26.499
Pardon my insolence but no one respects
your younger brother.

00:46:27.291 --> 00:46:30.083
And the British are inching
towards the estate.

00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:34.166
Bikrampur needs you now
more than ever.

00:46:38.416 --> 00:46:39.624
I see.

00:46:41.374 --> 00:46:45.416
You're determined to get me
out of here, Satya.

00:46:45.791 --> 00:46:47.749
Please take our advice.

00:46:48.499 --> 00:46:51.072
You'll return a completely changed man.

00:47:27.083 --> 00:47:28.541
Please watch your step.

00:47:30.416 --> 00:47:32.124
- Carefully...
- Come...

00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:35.999
Please come, my lord.

00:47:58.916 --> 00:48:00.624
Did you see, Satya?

00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:04.833
Something is wrong.

00:48:06.499 --> 00:48:09.708
It's been quite some time
that we've been here.

00:48:10.374 --> 00:48:12.873
I am not getting any better.

00:48:12.874 --> 00:48:14.791
In fact, I feel weaker.

00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.248
My hands are trembling.

00:48:17.249 --> 00:48:20.749
The target I could hit
with my eyes closed...

00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:23.083
I am missing it.

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.374
Ashwini.

00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:28.208
Well, actually...

00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:34.041
This is a very difficult disease, my lord.

00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:41.415
I see some progress...
However, it might be a little slow.

00:48:41.416 --> 00:48:44.208
Whatever it is, Ashwini...

00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:47.249
How can I miss my target?

00:48:48.083 --> 00:48:50.958
The fly is working just fine.

00:48:54.249 --> 00:48:56.083
Then, I...

00:48:57.749 --> 00:49:00.833
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri...

00:49:01.416 --> 00:49:04.041
has lost his impeccable aim?

00:49:05.624 --> 00:49:06.874
How?

00:49:06.999 --> 00:49:08.208
- Brother?
- Yes...

00:49:08.416 --> 00:49:12.333
Can we consult with another doctor?

00:49:13.416 --> 00:49:14.874
Of course, we can.

00:49:14.958 --> 00:49:16.374
Of course.

00:49:16.999 --> 00:49:19.415
I'll get a second opinion soon.

00:49:19.416 --> 00:49:23.249
But before that, Ashwini,
why don't you change the medicines?

00:49:24.833 --> 00:49:26.499
- No...
- Such a big target...

00:49:26.916 --> 00:49:31.123
- Let these medicines continue...
- How can it be?

00:49:31.124 --> 00:49:34.582
May be if I increase the dosage...

00:49:34.583 --> 00:49:36.833
Do whatever you want, Ashwini!

00:49:37.958 --> 00:49:39.374
But do something.

00:49:40.041 --> 00:49:41.041
Listen...

00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:45.083
- Send someone to the station...
- Okay.

00:49:45.374 --> 00:49:47.457
- Find out the train's departure time.
- I'm sending someone right away.

00:49:47.458 --> 00:49:49.832
- Don't worry...
- But what about brother...

00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:51.166
Come, sit.

00:49:51.416 --> 00:49:53.916
What's wrong, brother?

00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:55.838
Is Mahendra alright?

00:49:55.863 --> 00:49:56.795
Yes.

00:49:58.708 --> 00:50:02.208
I got the first telegram around 7 o'clock.

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.583
It says he has stomachache
and very high fever.

00:50:05.708 --> 00:50:07.416
He's under the doctor's supervision.

00:50:07.583 --> 00:50:12.745
An English civil surgeon,
Dr. Calvert is taking care of him.

00:50:13.208 --> 00:50:19.124
An Indian doctor,
Nibaran Sen was also there.

00:50:20.124 --> 00:50:21.983
I'm really worried.

00:51:19.999 --> 00:51:21.707
- Chandra, get up.
- Brother...

00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:22.416
Get up, Chandra.

00:51:22.417 --> 00:51:24.301
When can we get the death certificate?

00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:41.916
Make arrangements for the funeral.

00:51:43.124 --> 00:51:45.208
Go to the club once.

00:51:46.624 --> 00:51:49.666
See if you can find people for the funeral.

00:51:54.916 --> 00:51:57.666
Get up!

00:51:57.791 --> 00:51:59.958
Take her inside.

00:52:00.624 --> 00:52:01.458
Let's go.

00:52:01.459 --> 00:52:09.459
- Praise be to God.
- May God be praised.

00:52:36.083 --> 00:52:42.166
- Praise be to God.
- May God be praised.

00:52:58.624 --> 00:53:02.290
<i>This is how Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri
passed away.</i>

00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:07.290
<i>And he was cremated on the morning
of May 9th, 1909.</i>

00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:09.291
<i>That's all, Your Honour.</i>

00:53:10.208 --> 00:53:12.708
Prosecution may proceed now.

00:53:12.916 --> 00:53:14.415
Thank you, Your Honour.

00:53:14.416 --> 00:53:19.958
As the the first witness,
I would like to call upon a corpse.

00:53:20.416 --> 00:53:26.165
The corpse that was allegedly cremated
24 years ago on the 9th of May, 1909.

00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:30.083
The name of the corpse is
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:33.998
Objection, My Lord.
Preemption and leading the court.

00:53:33.999 --> 00:53:37.415
The court is being misled because...

00:53:37.416 --> 00:53:40.082
the plaintiff's identity
has not been proven yet.

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.583
Sustained.

00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:47.124
Counsel is requested to address
the plaintiff properly.

00:53:47.749 --> 00:53:48.998
Yes, My Lord.

00:53:48.999 --> 00:53:52.833
Then, I'll ask Mr. Plaintiff
to take the stand.

00:53:55.541 --> 00:53:58.666
Please state your name for the record.

00:53:59.499 --> 00:54:02.124
- Mahendra Kumar...
- Please speak louder.

00:54:03.249 --> 00:54:05.873
- Mahendra Kumar...
- You're wrong...

00:54:05.874 --> 00:54:08.916
Tell us your real name in full.

00:54:09.166 --> 00:54:12.207
- Why will I make it up?
- I can swear you're lying.

00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:14.957
- Why will I lie?
- How can I say?

00:54:14.958 --> 00:54:18.225
You're wasting the court's precious time.
Please tell us your correct name in full.

00:54:18.249 --> 00:54:21.208
- What kind of strange...
- You're wasting time...

00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:23.248
- No, I'm not...
- No, no, no...

00:54:23.249 --> 00:54:28.458
- My full name is Raja Mahendra Kumar...
- What did you say?

00:54:31.208 --> 00:54:32.958
What did you say
before Mahendra Kumar?

00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:35.333
- Raja...
- Say it loudly!

00:54:40.958 --> 00:54:44.958
My name is Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

00:54:45.374 --> 00:54:49.958
And I've come to reclaim my estate,
Your Honour.

00:54:56.208 --> 00:54:58.374
- Beautiful!
- This physical body...

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:14.665
Neku, go check where
that sound is coming from.

00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:15.666
I'm on it.

00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:38.291
Oh God! What is that?

00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:42.498
- Guru! Guru!
- What happened?

00:55:42.499 --> 00:55:45.166
Let's go... Come on...

00:55:45.749 --> 00:55:49.041
Come quickly...
This man is still alive...

00:55:49.541 --> 00:55:50.374
Who is it?

00:55:50.458 --> 00:55:52.624
<i>So, Neku saw...</i>

00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:55.873
<i>someone was lying on a funeral pyre...</i>

00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.916
<i>writhing in pain.</i>

00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:00.499
<i>Neku called us.</i>

00:56:00.999 --> 00:56:05.457
<i>I realised that he was considered dead.</i>

00:56:05.458 --> 00:56:07.749
<i>And he was brought to be cremated.</i>

00:56:08.374 --> 00:56:09.708
<i>After that...</i>

00:56:09.874 --> 00:56:13.666
<i>They left him there to take cover
from the storm.</i>

00:56:14.874 --> 00:56:19.458
<i>There were sores on his hands,
feet and nose.</i>

00:56:19.749 --> 00:56:21.707
<i>He was dying...</i>

00:56:21.708 --> 00:56:23.208
<i>He had high fever...</i>

00:56:23.249 --> 00:56:26.333
<i>And his entire body was shivering.</i>

00:56:26.999 --> 00:56:34.249
<i>So, we took him
to another camp downhill.</i>

00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:36.541
<i>Or else he would have died.</i>

00:56:36.833 --> 00:56:38.583
<i>He would not have survived.</i>

00:56:41.624 --> 00:56:45.666
<i>He was unconscious for four days
and four nights...</i>

00:56:46.333 --> 00:56:48.873
<i>We nursed him around the clock.</i>

00:56:48.874 --> 00:56:51.833
<i>We applied Ayurvedic medicines
on his sores.</i>

00:56:51.874 --> 00:56:55.083
<i>He started getting better.</i>

00:56:55.208 --> 00:56:58.833
<i>And since then,
he became one of us.</i>

00:56:59.083 --> 00:57:02.041
<i>We named him Sundar Das.</i>

00:57:02.458 --> 00:57:07.873
But he never mentioned who he was
or where he'd come from?

00:57:07.874 --> 00:57:11.291
No, he didn't remember anything.

00:57:11.458 --> 00:57:13.165
Absolutely nothing.

00:57:13.166 --> 00:57:16.915
He had lost his memory.

00:57:16.916 --> 00:57:24.916
Since then, he travelled the country
for almost 12 years with us.

00:57:25.124 --> 00:57:28.540
But I got to know
about the incident later.

00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:29.873
Oh, really?

00:57:29.874 --> 00:57:33.998
We heard a strange story from people.

00:57:33.999 --> 00:57:36.832
Story of a feudal lord from Dhaka...

00:57:36.833 --> 00:57:41.040
whose body disappeared
before being cremated.

00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:44.458
I get it... Amnesia.

00:57:44.541 --> 00:57:45.499
Great!

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:51.499
The easiest plot twist
for the screenplay writers and novelists.

00:57:51.749 --> 00:57:58.666
Your Holiness, please tell us where and why
you and your disciples disappeared to?

00:57:59.124 --> 00:58:02.833
We were in search of salvation.

00:58:25.999 --> 00:58:32.541
<i>Keep moving
The time is now or never</i>

00:58:33.833 --> 00:58:40.583
<i>Keep moving
The time is now or never</i>

00:58:41.708 --> 00:58:49.708
<i>I bow my head in worship</i>

00:58:54.583 --> 00:59:02.583
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:12.957
<i>I keep walking on embers</i>

00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:20.832
<i>No one knows where you are
But I keep walking miles in search of you</i>

00:59:20.833 --> 00:59:28.623
<i>The road is all I desire
I breathe a sigh of relief</i>

00:59:28.624 --> 00:59:36.123
<i>The stifled cries of the wounded heart
Remains buried deep within</i>

00:59:36.124 --> 00:59:44.124
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

00:59:59.874 --> 01:00:07.748
<i>Keep moving
The time is now or never</i>

01:00:07.749 --> 01:00:15.583
<i>I bow my head in worship</i>

01:00:18.958 --> 01:00:24.207
Guru, please help my sister.
She has lost her mind.

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:27.666
- She still believes...
- She is right.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.249
I have seen your brother.

01:00:31.499 --> 01:00:33.708
At Benaras.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:44.333
<i>I've crossed deserts, I've crossed seas
I've crossed storms of sorrow</i>

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:57.207
<i>I've crossed deserts, I've crossed seas
I've crossed storms of sorrow</i>

01:00:57.208 --> 01:01:05.208
<i>Like a mystic, I've crossed mountains
I've crossed universes</i>

01:01:07.666 --> 01:01:15.540
<i>They record names, they record deeds
But they don't record faces</i>

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:23.040
<i>They record names, they record deeds
But they don't record faces</i>

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:31.041
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:41.333
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:02:05.124 --> 01:02:13.124
<i>Let me breathe in the Sun
Let me breathe in each stone</i>

01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:25.873
<i>Let me breathe in the Sun
Let me breathe in each stone</i>

01:02:25.874 --> 01:02:33.874
<i>It's impossible to touch you
Let me just breathe in your essence</i>

01:02:36.249 --> 01:02:39.624
Where should we go next?

01:02:40.999 --> 01:02:44.332
We should head West.

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:48.707
There are many religious places,
lots of holy men and wise sages.

01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:52.165
Why not go South?
There are beautiful temples there.

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:53.707
Can't we visit those?

01:02:53.708 --> 01:02:55.540
And the most important thing is...

01:02:55.541 --> 01:03:00.290
Our country is surrounded by water
on the three sides.

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:05.207
And Kanyakumari is right in the middle of the
meeting point of the three water bodies.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:06.958
What do you think, Sundar Das?

01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:08.916
Dhaka.

01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:13.665
Pilgrimage in Dhaka?
Are you crazy?

01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:17.415
And if are going that way,
we can visit Kamakhya Temple too.

01:03:17.416 --> 01:03:18.208
- Yes, right...
- Let's go...

01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:20.041
But why Dhaka?

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:27.790
Guru... Guru...
I want to go back to Dhaka...

01:03:27.791 --> 01:03:29.290
- What happened?
- Hold him...

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:35.083
Thousands of thoughts...
Millions of faces...

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:37.040
Save me, guru...

01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:39.248
Please save me...

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:43.957
I'm drowning...

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:45.583
What's wrong with him?

01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:51.332
Wake up, Sundar.
Wake up.

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.749
It's time for you to wake up.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.624
Guru...

01:04:00.166 --> 01:04:05.915
Why do I feel I must go back to Dhaka?

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:09.083
Because you are a king in Dhaka.

01:04:14.249 --> 01:04:16.708
- King?
- Yes!

01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:26.290
What should I do, guru?

01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:28.541
You must return.

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:32.748
It's not yet time for you to leave
this materialistic world.

01:04:32.749 --> 01:04:35.916
But I don't want to go back.

01:04:36.333 --> 01:04:43.415
I've discarded this illusory world
a long time back.

01:04:43.416 --> 01:04:47.083
Each life has a meaning, Sundar.

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:54.291
You've been given a second life
to fulfill a higher purpose.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:58.998
Go back with my teachings
in mind.

01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:06.999
People, places, incidents and purpose
will all come back to you.

01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:14.416
Go forth, my child.
Claim your rightful place in the universe.

01:05:14.666 --> 01:05:16.791
Go on...

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:18.833
You must return.

01:05:20.624 --> 01:05:28.207
<i>The day comes to an end
But the foolish is none the wiser</i>

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:35.998
<i>The day comes to an end
But the foolish is none the wiser</i>

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:43.999
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:52.999
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:08.166
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:06:21.374 --> 01:06:29.374
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:37.583
<i>Why can't I see you?
Why can't I find you?</i>

01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:52.623
My Lord, this entire case is standing
on four salient points.

01:06:52.624 --> 01:06:55.707
First, identification.

01:06:55.708 --> 01:07:03.290
Second, similarity or dissimilarity between
my client and the second prince of Bikrampur.

01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:08.457
Third, the possibility of two corpses
being cremated.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:11.332
And lastly, the prince's...
Sorry...

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:16.499
The circumstances under which
my client's so-called demise happened.

01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:24.873
I want to call someone very close to the
prince, his sister, Mrinmoyee Devi.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:32.874
Mrinmoyee Devi, when and where
did you first see my client?

01:07:38.083 --> 01:07:43.165
It was the beginning
of the Bengali new year.

01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:51.166
Buddhu had told me about a hermit
who looked exactly like my brother.

01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:59.874
I requested the Zamindar of Kasimpur, Atul
to bring him to us.

01:08:02.249 --> 01:08:05.999
<i>I went to see him right away.</i>

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:10.166
He cut a strange figure.

01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:14.541
<i>Half naked, covered in ash...</i>

01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:39.291
What is your name, guru?

01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:50.208
Do you want to come home with us?

01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:56.416
We'll be truly blessed.

01:09:03.249 --> 01:09:07.749
My name is Sundar Das.

01:09:16.208 --> 01:09:21.749
Please come to our mansion.
We really need your blessings.

01:09:22.499 --> 01:09:29.583
Our family has gone through
many hardships, many deaths...

01:09:31.208 --> 01:09:35.124
Maybe your holy presence will...

01:09:37.208 --> 01:09:38.833
Guru...

01:09:45.208 --> 01:09:53.208
<i>My Lord, the royal garb you're dressed in
To visit the kingdom of my heart</i>

01:09:54.833 --> 01:10:02.665
<i>Millions of suns and moons
Pale in front of your glory</i>

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:07.540
<i>My Lord, the royal garb you're dressed in</i>

01:10:07.541 --> 01:10:15.541
<i>All pride subsides
All ego shatters</i>

01:10:24.708 --> 01:10:32.498
<i>My body and soul
Plays like the harp</i>

01:10:32.499 --> 01:10:40.499
<i>My Lord, the royal garb you're dressed in
To visit the kingdom of my heart</i>

01:10:41.916 --> 01:10:49.707
<i>Millions of suns and moons
Pale in front of your glory</i>

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:55.749
<i>My Lord, the royal garb you're dressed in</i>

01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:36.999
<i>The breeze ushers in joy and sorrow</i>

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:45.583
<i>All the flowers in garden
Bloom at your feet</i>

01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:54.041
<i>The breeze ushers in joy and sorrow</i>

01:11:54.708 --> 01:12:02.708
<i>All the flowers in garden
Bloom at your feet</i>

01:12:03.249 --> 01:12:11.249
<i>I gaze unflinchingly
I see nothing else in the world</i>

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:28.208
<i>I only want to delve deep into your soul
Where eternal beauty exists</i>

01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:36.291
<i>My Lord, the royal garb you're dressed in
To visit the kingdom of my heart</i>

01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:45.415
<i>Millions of suns and moons
Pale in front of your glory</i>

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:53.416
<i>My Lord, the royal garb you're dressed in
To visit the kingdom of my heart</i>

01:12:54.874 --> 01:13:02.458
<i>Millions of suns and moons
Pale in front of your glory</i>

01:13:03.208 --> 01:13:06.416
<i>Just a minute.
Let me get this straight.</i>

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:13.582
<i>You're saying that you recognised him
because he chose the sweet curd?</i>

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:15.915
That's not what I meant.

01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:18.248
The sweet curd was his favourite,
that's correct but...

01:13:18.249 --> 01:13:25.290
For an estate earning Rs. 10 lakhs annually,
if sweet curd has to be a favourite...

01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:27.123
then believe me, Mrinmoyee Devi...

01:13:27.124 --> 01:13:30.458
I've never eaten anything but sweet curd.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:34.665
- Order! Order!
- Your Honour...

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:41.082
I've scrutinised the way he looks,
his gait...

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.373
his hands while eating, his fingers,
his adam's apple...

01:13:44.374 --> 01:13:48.207
his eyes, the split
life line on his palm...

01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:51.873
Everything was like my brother's...
I mean Mahendra...

01:13:51.874 --> 01:13:54.748
Okay, okay...
It's alright...

01:13:54.749 --> 01:13:58.332
We'll come to the physical similarities
a little later.

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.290
Let's get done
with the memories first.

01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:03.040
When you were looking at him
very carefully...

01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:04.707
was it then that...

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:10.790
this imposter took advantage
of the grief-stricken sister...

01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:14.165
and claimed that he is
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri?

01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:16.165
Objection, Your Honour!
Leading the witness.

01:14:16.166 --> 01:14:19.583
Yes, My Lord but towards the truth.

01:14:23.374 --> 01:14:27.499
Order! Order! Objection sustained.

01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:28.499
Everything is still dependent
on the evidence.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.332
Everything is still dependent
on the evidence.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:31.623
So, please address the plaintiff correctly.

01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:33.832
So, please address the plaintiff correctly.

01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:35.499
Yes, My Lord.

01:14:36.166 --> 01:14:42.416
Is that when the plaintiff of this case...

01:14:43.249 --> 01:14:45.082
claimed the lordship over the estate?

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:49.499
No, never! Absolutely not!

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:53.333
We're the ones who forced him.

01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:58.291
He had left and we brought him back
to the mansion.

01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:03.458
That's the first time,
I mentioned it to him.

01:15:04.874 --> 01:15:09.708
Guru, I want to show you some photographs.

01:15:15.374 --> 01:15:19.166
This is Narendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

01:15:20.374 --> 01:15:24.208
Our beloved younger brother.

01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.541
He has passed away.

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:38.291
This is Debendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:49.208
Our beloved eldest brother.

01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:52.833
The first prince of this province.

01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:57.583
He has also passed away.

01:16:00.374 --> 01:16:04.499
Why are you crying, guru?

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.374
Illusion...

01:16:09.749 --> 01:16:11.833
Whose illusion?

01:16:18.249 --> 01:16:26.249
He's the one closest to my heart.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:32.374
The brother I love the most.

01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:42.666
The one I loved more than my own life.

01:16:48.666 --> 01:16:52.374
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:15.374
He passed away in Darjeeling.

01:17:16.166 --> 01:17:18.665
Some people say...

01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:25.666
When his body was taken for cremation,
a violent storm hit Darjeeling.

01:17:26.416 --> 01:17:33.583
So, they left him there
and ran for cover.

01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:38.874
Some say he was cremated...

01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:41.708
Some say he wasn't.

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:48.208
What do you think, guru?

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:53.374
He wasn't cremated.

01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:57.708
He's alive.

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:07.833
You have an uncanny resemblance
with my brother, Mahendra.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.541
Uncanny...

01:18:14.374 --> 01:18:22.374
- Are you my brother?
- No! No...

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:28.916
I have no one in this world...
I don't belong here...

01:18:30.874 --> 01:18:34.083
- I don't belong to anyone...
- Please, wait...

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.624
<i>What histrionics!</i>

01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:43.166
Hollywood would love this story.
Anyway, then what happened?

01:18:45.208 --> 01:18:52.790
He left home in a lot of anger.
He had disappeared for days.

01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:59.498
The family and the subjects of the estate
looked everywhere for him.

01:18:59.499 --> 01:19:06.332
After about 16 days,
my son, Budhhu and Atul...

01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:11.374
found him and brought him back
to the mansion.

01:19:12.041 --> 01:19:17.457
By then the news had spread all across
Bengal. Thousands had come to see him.

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:21.498
The subjects started bringing him presents.

01:19:21.499 --> 01:19:23.208
<i>They even started saying...</i>

01:19:23.249 --> 01:19:27.915
<i>the case that had to be filed to reclaim
the estate from the British...</i>

01:19:27.916 --> 01:19:32.207
<i>they'll arrange for the money
to fight the case.</i>

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:35.248
<i>Pamphlets were being printed.</i>

01:19:35.249 --> 01:19:37.791
<i>Stories were being written.</i>

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:41.291
<i>Bards were singing about him.</i>

01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.207
Finally, one day...

01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:46.499
Excuse me...

01:19:49.874 --> 01:19:53.124
I have a small request for you.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:20:01.583
Please don't put ash on your body
after your bath.

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:08.583
Please move aside...
Make way...

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:35.958
I am certain you are my
lost brother, Mahendra.

01:21:42.374 --> 01:21:45.332
I'm begging you...

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:48.958
Please tell us who you are.

01:21:49.749 --> 01:21:53.373
Reveal your identity...

01:21:53.374 --> 01:21:56.749
You've lost your mind!

01:21:57.374 --> 01:22:00.583
You've gone mad.

01:22:01.749 --> 01:22:09.166
I'm not your brother...
I'm nothing.

01:22:11.999 --> 01:22:15.499
I'm not from this world.

01:22:17.124 --> 01:22:22.499
I have nothing to do with this world.

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:31.416
This world full of envy, deceit,
treachery, greed...

01:22:37.999 --> 01:22:44.165
Please let me go.
I don't belong here.

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:47.998
Please let me go...

01:22:47.999 --> 01:22:50.915
Please don't leave us, brother...
I beg you...

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:55.624
We've lived by only one hope
for the last 12 years.

01:22:56.291 --> 01:23:00.915
We've wished for the rumours
to be true.

01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:05.958
We've wished for you to be alive.

01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:10.540
Bikrampur is ruined, brother.

01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:14.124
The British have taken over
our entire estate...

01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:18.041
And just pays us some pittance.

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:22.291
The subjects are outraged
at their tyranny.

01:23:22.624 --> 01:23:26.540
The entire country is
under their occupation.

01:23:26.541 --> 01:23:33.707
If you return, hope for Bikrampur and the
entire country, will return with you...

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:37.498
Please don't do this to us.
You're our only hope...

01:23:37.499 --> 01:23:41.041
Please forgive me.

01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:44.416
I'm sorry...

01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:48.873
This is a huge responsibilty.

01:23:48.874 --> 01:23:51.708
Please forgive me.

01:23:53.458 --> 01:23:59.958
I've left this realm long time back.

01:24:00.874 --> 01:24:04.999
I don't want to return to this quicksand.

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:08.958
I have renounced it.

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:12.665
Please let me go...
Please...

01:24:12.666 --> 01:24:14.498
- Guru... Guru...
- I'm not him... Please leave me...

01:24:14.499 --> 01:24:19.082
Please forgive me...
Please let me go.

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:20.498
Please don't leave...

01:24:20.499 --> 01:24:22.957
Please let me go...

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:24.541
Please sit down...

01:24:24.583 --> 01:24:26.707
Guru, please take a seat...

01:24:26.708 --> 01:24:31.415
- I have to go...
- Please sit...

01:24:31.416 --> 01:24:37.748
Long live Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri!

01:24:37.749 --> 01:24:40.083
Do you hear that, brother?

01:24:40.791 --> 01:24:44.874
Thousands of people want you to come back.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:50.165
They want you.

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:54.873
You're a beacon of hope,
of strength, of life for them.

01:24:54.874 --> 01:24:57.291
You are their very own...

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:00.249
You belong to them.

01:25:00.749 --> 01:25:03.041
Their own blood.

01:25:03.374 --> 01:25:07.291
Doesn't any of this
mean anything to you?

01:25:16.499 --> 01:25:17.958
Alright then.

01:25:18.916 --> 01:25:22.333
Since our life has no value for you...

01:25:22.624 --> 01:25:26.541
I'm sure our death would
not move you either.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.791
That's why, I'm going...

01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:37.249
to the room where we would arrange
weddings for the cats...

01:25:37.374 --> 01:25:40.124
the room we played hide and seek in...

01:25:41.249 --> 01:25:45.624
the shade of the mango tree
beside the window...

01:25:47.833 --> 01:25:51.458
where you told me stories
about monsters in the afternoon...

01:25:52.166 --> 01:25:55.124
I'm going back to that room.

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:01.041
To hang myself.

01:26:02.749 --> 01:26:05.874
Minu, no...

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:06.916
Mother...

01:26:06.917 --> 01:26:09.708
Anand...

01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:18.166
Call the barber.

01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:47.541
Long live Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri!

01:27:11.749 --> 01:27:12.374
<i>My Lord...</i>

01:27:12.749 --> 01:27:14.623
"Notice is hereby given that...

01:27:14.624 --> 01:27:16.873
<i>"...the board has the conclusive proof...</i>

01:27:16.874 --> 01:27:21.165

01:27:23.374 --> 01:27:25.249

<i>"J. H. Lindsay, Collector of Dhaka."
My Lord...</i>

01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:48.082
It's clear as day from this notice
and the supporting documents...

01:27:48.083 --> 01:27:52.248
that this man is a fraud from Punjab
called Mal Singh.

01:27:52.249 --> 01:27:56.665
And in no way, the Second Prince
of Bikrampur.

01:27:56.666 --> 01:28:02.291
And I'll prove that
beyond reasonable doubt in this court.

01:28:02.666 --> 01:28:08.457
So, you're claiming that you're Bikrampur's
Second Prince...

01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:10.833
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri, correct?

01:28:11.749 --> 01:28:13.291
Incorrect.

01:28:14.416 --> 01:28:16.874
Oh, really? How?

01:28:18.333 --> 01:28:22.374
You're claiming that I'm
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri. Not me.

01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:28.915
Order! Order!

01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:30.833
Touché!

01:28:31.499 --> 01:28:35.249
So, Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri...

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:38.124
What is an LBW?

01:28:41.166 --> 01:28:42.208
What?

01:28:42.624 --> 01:28:44.248
LBW?

01:28:44.249 --> 01:28:45.749
LBW...

01:28:46.833 --> 01:28:49.458
Popping crease?

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:53.416
What about the Chinaman? Nothing?

01:28:55.999 --> 01:28:58.540
True. It's not possible
to remember everything.

01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:03.541
Okay, then tell us what is a polo banian?

01:29:04.041 --> 01:29:06.958
No? Nearside, backhand, a chukker?

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.207
What food goes well with white wine?

01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:12.458
What are military collars?
Lounge suit?

01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:14.083
Chesterfield coat?

01:29:14.333 --> 01:29:16.915
You were such an expert shot.
So, tell me...

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:21.373
Muzzle end? Breech end?
Dum Dum bullet? Martini Henry?

01:29:21.374 --> 01:29:22.541
What are these?

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.249
No idea?

01:29:25.499 --> 01:29:31.332
Even if I overlook the Hindi accent
with which you speak Bengali...

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:33.998
Are you trying to say that...

01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:36.873
Bikrampur's Second Prince who was...

01:29:36.874 --> 01:29:39.623
accustomed to the English way of life...

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.998
who wore clothes
in the latest English fashion.

01:29:41.999 --> 01:29:43.998
Who loved playing polo and cricket...

01:29:43.999 --> 01:29:48.332
who was one of the best shooters
and horse riders around these parts...

01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:51.166
he doesn't know
what any of these words mean?

01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:58.999
Or maybe the farmer from Punjab, Mal Singh,
hasn't been tutored properly?

01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:04.582
But he had forgotten that an imposter
can claim property, not royal blood.

01:30:04.583 --> 01:30:06.499
I don't want the estate!

01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:10.583
I am not doing it for myself.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:19.624
This is not my domain...
I had no such desire.

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:23.458
I had told my teacher...

01:30:24.749 --> 01:30:27.374
that I don't want to come back.

01:30:28.416 --> 01:30:30.749
I had told Minu...

01:30:31.749 --> 01:30:34.124
I had even told Anand...

01:30:34.208 --> 01:30:36.624
I told Grandmother...

01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:45.583
I had tried to reason with the officials
and the subjects of the estate.

01:30:45.624 --> 01:30:46.915
My Lord...

01:30:46.916 --> 01:30:49.583
All this is not for me.

01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:53.415
I've only come back for my farmers.

01:30:53.416 --> 01:30:57.499
The ones who can't pay their taxes
to the British during the drought.

01:30:58.124 --> 01:31:02.708
My Lord, I've come back for my sister.

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:08.708
The sister who lived for 12 years only
with the hope that her brother is alive.

01:31:09.958 --> 01:31:11.124
My Lord...

01:31:12.541 --> 01:31:17.666
I've been scrutinised like an animal
to check the marks on my body.

01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:22.458
Your Honour, the police tried
to threaten me.

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:29.708
Even high ranking British officials
tried to scare me.

01:31:30.083 --> 01:31:33.708
There's been attempts on my life as well.

01:31:36.749 --> 01:31:39.749
I'm very tired, Your Honour.

01:31:41.999 --> 01:31:44.249
I'm very tired.

01:31:45.999 --> 01:31:50.123
Please let me go, Your Honour.

01:31:50.124 --> 01:31:51.249
Your witness.

01:32:02.333 --> 01:32:05.583
So, Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri...

01:32:05.916 --> 01:32:08.374
Do you sing well?

01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:12.749
Can you sing?

01:32:13.583 --> 01:32:14.833
Yes, sir.

01:32:14.999 --> 01:32:17.123
Can you sing us a couple of lines?

01:32:17.124 --> 01:32:19.249
Objection, My Lord!

01:32:19.999 --> 01:32:26.708
I think my learned friend is trying
to organise a soirée in the court.

01:32:26.833 --> 01:32:29.415
Although, I am a music lover myself...

01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:32.082
but I'm sure this falls
under the contempt of court.

01:32:32.083 --> 01:32:39.458
I'm asking these questions to further
my line of argument.

01:32:39.666 --> 01:32:42.333
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you, My Lord.

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:45.458
Let's hear a couple of lines.

01:32:49.999 --> 01:32:57.540
<i>We're like birds, father</i>

01:32:57.541 --> 01:33:05.541
<i>We're like birds, father</i>

01:33:06.499 --> 01:33:13.998
<i>We are going to fly away</i>

01:33:13.999 --> 01:33:19.249
<i>We're like birds, father</i>

01:33:19.291 --> 01:33:21.333
Wonderful! You sing quite well.

01:33:21.916 --> 01:33:25.249
Now, tell what is a legato?

01:33:25.999 --> 01:33:29.208
A capella? Arpeggio?

01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:30.958
You have no idea?

01:33:31.083 --> 01:33:34.498
The major E scale?
The straight technique in music?

01:33:34.499 --> 01:33:38.333
What about the different rhythms
in Indian classical music? No idea.

01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:46.999
My lord, rumour is you were a regular
at the whore houses of Calcutta.

01:33:47.624 --> 01:33:49.708
I mean...

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.291
You were addicted to women.

01:33:54.291 --> 01:33:58.249
Apart from your wife,
you had many other lovers.

01:33:58.291 --> 01:34:00.332
You had an adventurous sex life...

01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:01.624
Is it true?

01:34:04.874 --> 01:34:05.624
Yes...

01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:09.083
Well, now tell the court
what is a clitoral orgasm?

01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:12.291
What is testosterone?

01:34:12.541 --> 01:34:14.540
What is erectile dysfunction?

01:34:14.541 --> 01:34:15.998
At least, tell me the meaning of fellatio?

01:34:15.999 --> 01:34:17.458
Objection, My Lord!

01:34:18.666 --> 01:34:21.999
Inconsequential! Irrelevant! Obscene!

01:34:23.124 --> 01:34:27.541
The counsel should think before he speaks
at least in court.

01:34:27.624 --> 01:34:29.123
Objection sustained.

01:34:29.124 --> 01:34:31.791
What are you trying to prove, Mr. Mukherji?

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.748
Nothing much, My Lord.

01:34:33.749 --> 01:34:35.832
Just trying to say that...

01:34:35.833 --> 01:34:40.290
any person can be a good shot
or a great rider...

01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:43.957
Any ordinary person can be very dextrous...

01:34:43.958 --> 01:34:47.333
based on their natural ability.

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:53.832
But that doesn't mean that he'll know
every jargon of that discipline.

01:34:53.833 --> 01:34:58.540
My learned friend has been trying to prove
that Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri...

01:34:58.541 --> 01:35:02.040
was almost an Englishman
in the way he led his life.

01:35:02.041 --> 01:35:03.915
It's not just laughable but a complete lie.

01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:06.040
Because Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri...

01:35:06.041 --> 01:35:09.124
never used cutlery to eat.

01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:11.123
He never spoke English.

01:35:11.124 --> 01:35:14.749
In fact, he stayed a million miles away
from the English influence.

01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:18.415
Ram Singh Subha,
you're saying...

01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:22.748
<i>At 7.30 in the evening, you saw
Raja Mahendra's dead body and...</i>

01:35:22.749 --> 01:35:24.873
<i>And his family members were lamenting.</i>

01:35:24.874 --> 01:35:25.624
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:35:25.625 --> 01:35:28.873
<i>But the Defense Counsel is insisting
that the time of death is...</i>

01:35:28.874 --> 01:35:32.165
is 12 at night.

01:35:32.166 --> 01:35:36.332
And that's why the last rites
were performed in the morning.

01:35:36.333 --> 01:35:39.082
No, sir. I remember very clearly.

01:35:39.083 --> 01:35:43.915
<i>I walked in at 7.30.
And I saw Satya explaining something...</i>

01:35:43.916 --> 01:35:47.041
<i>And I noticed the women
of the household crying.</i>

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:53.498
So, you're saying you're certain
about the time of death.

01:35:53.499 --> 01:35:55.082
No, Your Honour.

01:35:55.083 --> 01:36:00.749
I will trouble you one last time.

01:36:00.874 --> 01:36:04.707
I know you've lost someone
you loved...

01:36:04.708 --> 01:36:06.957
And you're still mourning that loss.

01:36:06.958 --> 01:36:12.040
But I would still request you to look
at that man carefully, Chandraboti Devi.

01:36:12.041 --> 01:36:16.126
Is he your husband,
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri?

01:36:42.624 --> 01:36:44.231
No.

01:36:47.416 --> 01:36:53.619
He is not my husband.
I don't know him.

01:36:53.644 --> 01:36:57.958
Silence in the court. Order. Order!

01:36:58.333 --> 01:37:01.458
Order! Order! Order!

01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:03.832
Thank you, Chandraboti Devi.

01:37:03.833 --> 01:37:06.399
My Lord, we all know the
dire conditions under

01:37:06.424 --> 01:37:10.632
which widows live in the Hindu society.

01:37:11.083 --> 01:37:14.415
Even though she could have found
an easy way out of this misery...

01:37:14.416 --> 01:37:20.665
My client has proven herself
to be a truthful, honest, righteous woman.

01:37:20.666 --> 01:37:24.583
And she has exposed this imposter
for who he really is.

01:37:24.791 --> 01:37:26.458
Your witness.

01:37:36.749 --> 01:37:41.999
Chandraboti Devi, please take another look
at that person.

01:37:44.374 --> 01:37:48.749
Are you positive that man
is not your husband?

01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:54.499
Yes, I'm sure.

01:37:58.624 --> 01:38:00.583
Order! Order!

01:38:01.833 --> 01:38:03.458
Good.

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:09.457
Then how does he know the marks
and spots on your body...

01:38:09.458 --> 01:38:12.123
that only your husband can know?

01:38:12.124 --> 01:38:14.415
- What is all this?
- Please keep calm...

01:38:14.416 --> 01:38:16.332
Please be quiet...

01:38:16.333 --> 01:38:19.708
- Please present the list to the court.
- Please maintain order.

01:38:19.958 --> 01:38:23.873
The first point on the list mentions
a mole on...

01:38:23.874 --> 01:38:26.416
Objection, My Lord!

01:38:26.666 --> 01:38:28.748
What exactly is happening here?

01:38:28.749 --> 01:38:36.748
In open court, my client, in fact a lady
is being blatantly insulted.

01:38:36.749 --> 01:38:43.832
Since, you're objecting, please tell us
where is it mentioned in the lawbooks...

01:38:43.833 --> 01:38:45.998
that only women can be insulted?

01:38:45.999 --> 01:38:50.332
According to you, only women
deserve respect. And men don't.

01:38:50.333 --> 01:38:53.415
You've been calling my client
a fraud, trickster, an imposter...

01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:55.373
Mr. Mukherji.

01:38:55.374 --> 01:38:58.540
- You've been insulting him...
- But that's what we're trying to prove...

01:38:58.541 --> 01:39:01.708
Mr. Mukherji, a word.

01:39:03.624 --> 01:39:04.291
Yes, tell me.

01:39:04.292 --> 01:39:06.207
I might be a bad husband.

01:39:06.208 --> 01:39:12.208
I've might have neglected my wife.

01:39:12.249 --> 01:39:14.290
But she's still my wife.

01:39:14.291 --> 01:39:18.207
So, if you want to present any evidence,
do it in private.

01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:22.290
They're trying to prove that
you're a fraud, an imposter...

01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:23.957
She can make us lose the case.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.332
I don't care if we lose.

01:39:25.333 --> 01:39:30.833
It doesn't matter
what they call me, Mr. Mukherji.

01:39:31.374 --> 01:39:36.624
She is my wife even today.
And the queen of Bikrampur.

01:39:36.791 --> 01:39:39.958
And you can't talk to a queen like that.

01:39:40.916 --> 01:39:43.540
You may go now.

01:39:43.541 --> 01:39:47.833
- But, brother...
- Minu, I said what I had to.

01:40:01.624 --> 01:40:07.833
Chandraboti Devi, tell us
about your husband's nature and character.

01:40:09.916 --> 01:40:17.916
Women of the royal family don't discuss
their husbands in public.

01:40:18.583 --> 01:40:22.832
Were you happily married
to your husband?

01:40:22.833 --> 01:40:26.457
He didn't have time for you.
He spent more time with his mistresses.

01:40:26.458 --> 01:40:30.415
He literally lived in the whore houses.
He contracted syphilis.

01:40:30.416 --> 01:40:33.873
Let's say, if he disappeared,
if he was somehow lost...

01:40:33.874 --> 01:40:36.498
However painful widowhood might be...

01:40:36.499 --> 01:40:42.240
Would you ever want that wanton,
depraved man back?

01:40:45.791 --> 01:40:47.333
Would you?

01:40:56.208 --> 01:40:58.040
You finally came?

01:40:58.041 --> 01:41:02.541
I thought you would stand me up.

01:41:03.166 --> 01:41:05.916
You reached out after such a long time...

01:41:06.249 --> 01:41:09.291
- What did you want to talk about?
- Please, sit.

01:41:10.916 --> 01:41:14.916
How is your wife? Your son?

01:41:15.083 --> 01:41:17.416
As far as I know, they're fine.

01:41:18.124 --> 01:41:21.249
Did you call me here to discuss
my family?

01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:25.041
No... No...

01:41:25.499 --> 01:41:29.290
Even if we assume...

01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:34.374
that your client is really Bikrampur's
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

01:41:35.208 --> 01:41:45.099
But why are you fighting so hard
for a cruel, abominal, depraved man?

01:41:45.124 --> 01:41:48.165
I am working hard to protect
my client's interest.

01:41:48.166 --> 01:41:50.165
And nothing can harm him.

01:41:50.166 --> 01:41:53.248
It's my job to give him back
what is rightfully his.

01:41:53.249 --> 01:41:56.874
The estate, maybe.

01:41:57.416 --> 01:42:01.665
But when the wife isn't accepting him
as the husband.

01:42:01.666 --> 01:42:05.291
And a section of people
will always doubt him.

01:42:05.374 --> 01:42:11.083
In this scenario, I'm sure your client
is not expecting to win everything back.

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:15.666
I don't know the current valuation
of the Bikrampur estate.

01:42:16.124 --> 01:42:18.874
Or the mental condition
of Chandraboti Devi.

01:42:19.208 --> 01:42:23.998
But if my client wins this case,
Satya will lose.

01:42:23.999 --> 01:42:26.166
But truth will prevail.

01:42:26.333 --> 01:42:31.499
Truth is the greatest triumph
in itself, Anupama.

01:42:32.124 --> 01:42:35.874
Well, actually...

01:42:36.547 --> 01:42:38.999
You've never been able to evaluate...

01:42:39.708 --> 01:42:44.624
or understand anyone's
mental state ever.

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.458
No point discussing that now.

01:42:47.517 --> 01:42:53.165
But what if the truth is that he is not
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri?

01:42:53.166 --> 01:42:54.999
That doesn't matter.

01:42:55.291 --> 01:42:58.666
I'm fighting for a greater truth
through this case.

01:42:59.416 --> 01:43:02.708
Self-governance... the British
oppression... Etcetera...

01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:06.352
Etcetera... Etcetera...

01:43:07.624 --> 01:43:09.275
Etcetera...

01:43:10.916 --> 01:43:12.623
Khudiram Bose...

01:43:12.624 --> 01:43:13.874
Bhagat Singh...

01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:15.916
Ashfaqulla Khan...

01:43:16.041 --> 01:43:17.791
Master Surya Sen...

01:43:18.041 --> 01:43:24.249
A lot of people like them have been framed
in false cases and hanged to death.

01:43:24.583 --> 01:43:24.958
True.

01:43:24.959 --> 01:43:30.124
The only weapon they had...
The British Law.

01:43:32.124 --> 01:43:39.207
I want to use their own laws
and rules against them and win this case.

01:43:39.208 --> 01:43:45.291
For 200 years, they've been looting
our country with this excuse.

01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:51.333
Even if it's just this once, it's
time for us to give it back to them.

01:43:52.583 --> 01:43:57.040
Wonderful! Your Indian National Congress
membership is just a formality now.

01:43:57.041 --> 01:43:59.248
So is your Ray Bahadur title!

01:43:59.249 --> 01:44:02.873
Why are you representing
the British in this case?

01:44:02.874 --> 01:44:05.208
What if that man is really the King?

01:44:06.083 --> 01:44:08.936
That's why I'm fighting even more fiercely.

01:44:10.374 --> 01:44:11.748
What do you mean?

01:44:11.749 --> 01:44:16.249
I just don't want that scoundrel
to get the estate back.

01:44:17.333 --> 01:44:22.790
She's a young girl... Unwell... His wife...

01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:28.458
He left her alone night after night
to indulge himself.

01:44:28.749 --> 01:44:31.624
I don't want him to ruin anyone else's life
just because he can.

01:44:31.708 --> 01:44:34.207
- I won't let that happen.
- And what about justice?

01:44:34.208 --> 01:44:38.457
He might be a man of bad character
but he should get what is legally...

01:44:38.458 --> 01:44:40.207
Legally?

01:44:40.208 --> 01:44:44.998
Bhaskar, Law is neither British nor Indian.

01:44:44.999 --> 01:44:47.582
It's just Male.

01:44:47.583 --> 01:44:48.208
Not again...

01:44:48.209 --> 01:44:54.190
So please keep fighting for
the abstract map you call country...

01:44:54.541 --> 01:44:57.707
I'll fight for my real flesh
and blood Chandraboti.

01:44:57.708 --> 01:45:00.874
Why didn't you appear for the last hearing?

01:45:02.499 --> 01:45:05.540
Not confident of the testimony
you've been tutored?

01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:07.916
They scared me, Your Honour.

01:45:08.999 --> 01:45:11.373
The police officer said he'll beat me up...

01:45:11.374 --> 01:45:15.041
if I spoke for Mahendra Kumar.

01:45:15.499 --> 01:45:20.499
They said they'll give me Rs. 50
to speak against him.

01:45:21.541 --> 01:45:27.624
I might be a prostitute...

01:45:29.749 --> 01:45:34.208
but I had loved that man once.
With all my heart.

01:45:37.583 --> 01:45:39.582
How could I stay away?

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:43.832
I got to know about his death on 8th May,
in the evening.

01:45:43.833 --> 01:45:48.123
I was getting ready to go
to the Victoria Hospital.

01:45:48.124 --> 01:45:51.123
I heard the wailing of some women.

01:45:51.124 --> 01:45:56.832
On 8th May, a strange incident took place
in Victoria Hospital.

01:45:56.833 --> 01:45:59.499
Incident in the hospital?

01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:01.998
Do you remember?

01:46:01.999 --> 01:46:04.791
No.

01:46:05.166 --> 01:46:08.290
Please try to remember.
This is very important.

01:46:08.291 --> 01:46:11.708
Nothing is coming to my mind now.

01:46:13.621 --> 01:46:15.248
Please try a little harder.

01:46:15.249 --> 01:46:19.833
My Lord, please give him some time.
This is really very important.

01:46:19.916 --> 01:46:25.249
I know it's an incident that took place
26 years ago but please try.

01:46:25.958 --> 01:46:27.766
I can't.

01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:30.332
Oh wait... wait... wait...

01:46:30.333 --> 01:46:32.416
I think I remember...

01:46:33.124 --> 01:46:36.957
The dead body of a Lepcha had disappeared.

01:46:36.958 --> 01:46:39.999
It had vanished from the morgue.

01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:41.957
I remember clearly now.

01:46:41.958 --> 01:46:46.832
Fair, fat... What was the name?

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:50.791
Why can't I remember his name?
What was it?

01:46:52.583 --> 01:46:56.333
- Pengumche?
- Yes, Pengumche!

01:46:56.708 --> 01:46:58.123
But how did you know?

01:46:58.124 --> 01:47:01.874
For the last two years, we've heard
the testimonies of 400 witnesses.

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:08.583
That includes his lord's sisters, their
husbands, their children, their servants...

01:47:08.874 --> 01:47:11.749
their employees, their subjects...

01:47:12.374 --> 01:47:16.999
They've unanimously attested
that my client is...

01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:19.274
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

01:47:19.749 --> 01:47:26.540
So, now I'll call someone
who has testified against him.

01:47:26.541 --> 01:47:30.665
Mr. Satya Banerjee,
please take the stand.

01:47:30.666 --> 01:47:34.782
Mr. Banerjee, I'm having some trouble
with the timeline.

01:47:35.416 --> 01:47:40.251
You said Mahendra died on 8th May.

01:47:40.833 --> 01:47:45.040
Then, why was he cremated
on 9th May?

01:47:45.041 --> 01:47:47.291
Why did you wait for so long?

01:47:47.499 --> 01:47:50.957
Actually, it was quite late at night...

01:47:50.958 --> 01:47:54.123
<i>Around midnight...
That's why...</i>

01:47:54.124 --> 01:47:55.873
his last rites...

01:47:55.874 --> 01:47:59.624
But Ram Singh said he
died at around 7:30 PM.

01:47:59.672 --> 01:48:07.791
<i>What were you doing between 7:30 PM
and the next morning?</i>

01:48:18.588 --> 01:48:19.880
Listen.

01:48:21.416 --> 01:48:26.345
Please write a draft of the condolence
message that Dr. Calvert will send Debendra.

01:48:27.041 --> 01:48:29.666
Offer him some of Chandra's jewellery.

01:48:29.854 --> 01:48:31.666
Get up... Get up!

01:48:34.249 --> 01:48:38.499
Please take her inside.

01:48:41.749 --> 01:48:42.749
Let's go...

01:49:34.271 --> 01:49:36.127
It's raining cats and dogs!

01:49:36.152 --> 01:49:38.138
- Let's go...
- But where?

01:49:38.163 --> 01:49:41.707
- We'll cremate him later...
- But what about his lordship's body?

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:42.208
Come with me...

01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:44.915
- But what about the body?
- Ashwini, please let's go...

01:49:44.916 --> 01:49:48.041
Let's take cover somewhere.
We'll figure it out later.

01:50:17.541 --> 01:50:18.901
The rain has stopped...
Let's go...

01:50:23.041 --> 01:50:26.791
- Has the rain stopped?
- Yes, let's go.

01:50:28.458 --> 01:50:31.124
Let's go...

01:50:31.333 --> 01:50:34.248
Be quick about it...

01:50:34.249 --> 01:50:36.416
Come, Ashwini.

01:50:45.458 --> 01:50:47.124
Where did the body go?

01:50:48.958 --> 01:50:51.666
Ghost! Ghost!

01:50:53.958 --> 01:50:55.583
Where's the body?

01:50:56.374 --> 01:50:57.458
Where is it?

01:50:59.291 --> 01:51:00.958
You all look that side...

01:51:02.333 --> 01:51:03.666
Where can the body go?

01:51:04.166 --> 01:51:07.333
Look that side...

01:51:10.416 --> 01:51:13.583
Find him right now!

01:51:17.749 --> 01:51:20.082
Search carefully.

01:51:20.083 --> 01:51:22.124
- Ashwini, listen carefully...
- Yes...

01:51:23.583 --> 01:51:26.791
He has disappeared...

01:51:27.374 --> 01:51:29.175
He knows everything...

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.041
He'll know only if he's alive.

01:51:31.124 --> 01:51:32.665
You said he's clinically dead...

01:51:32.666 --> 01:51:33.166
Yes, I did.

01:51:33.167 --> 01:51:35.290
- You said clinically dead, didn't you?
- I did! I did!

01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:37.748
Now, listen to me calmly...
Clinically dead, right?

01:51:37.749 --> 01:51:39.291
What if I made a mistake?

01:51:39.999 --> 01:51:42.623
What if he's not clinically dead?

01:51:42.624 --> 01:51:45.332
What if he comes back?
What if we're wrong?

01:51:45.333 --> 01:51:47.374
Shut up...

01:51:47.666 --> 01:51:49.333
Don't say another word.

01:51:49.791 --> 01:51:52.624
Listen to me very carefully...
This is what we're going to do next...

01:51:52.833 --> 01:51:54.249
We have to find false witnesses.

01:51:54.749 --> 01:51:56.832
We need a fake death certificate.

01:51:56.833 --> 01:51:58.753
We'll need to print an obituary
in the newspaper.

01:51:58.916 --> 01:52:00.791
What is most important right now...

01:52:01.166 --> 01:52:03.458
We need a body to cremate.

01:52:03.708 --> 01:52:05.499
We need a body, Ashwini.

01:52:06.624 --> 01:52:08.333
- A body?
- A body...

01:52:08.416 --> 01:52:11.749
- We need a body...
- I can't do this... I can't do it...

01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:16.208
I can't get a dead body...
I am sorry...

01:52:16.666 --> 01:52:20.165
Please, understand this very clearly...

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:21.373
I can't do it.

01:52:21.374 --> 01:52:25.291
Put this in your head so that
you can say this in your sleep too.

01:52:26.284 --> 01:52:30.248
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri
died of a disease.

01:52:30.249 --> 01:52:32.374
What is the name of the disease?
Tell me... Tell me...

01:52:32.499 --> 01:52:35.957
- Biliary colic... Biliary colic... Biliary colic...
- Biliary colic... Biliary colic... Biliary colic...

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:37.374
Ashwini?

01:52:38.541 --> 01:52:40.718
Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri
was not murdered.

01:52:40.874 --> 01:52:41.958
He...

01:52:42.833 --> 01:52:44.748
- He what?
- He died...

01:52:44.749 --> 01:52:46.123
- He died...
- He died... He died... He died...

01:52:46.124 --> 01:52:47.791
- He died...
- Yes... Yes...

01:52:48.687 --> 01:52:49.957
Do you go to Victoria Hospital?

01:52:49.958 --> 01:52:51.457
Do you go to Victoria Hospital?!

01:52:51.458 --> 01:52:51.916
Yes... Yes...

01:52:51.917 --> 01:52:53.248
Do they have a morgue?

01:52:53.249 --> 01:52:54.290
Do they have a morgue?!

01:52:54.291 --> 01:52:56.041
Get up... Get up...

01:52:56.999 --> 01:52:58.999
Take her inside...

01:53:00.083 --> 01:53:00.749
Let's go...

01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:08.750
- Praise be to God.
- May God be praised.

01:53:58.833 --> 01:54:00.623
<i>So, Satya...</i>

01:54:00.624 --> 01:54:05.540
<i>On the morning of 9th May, 1909,
at the Darjeeling crematorium...</i>

01:54:05.541 --> 01:54:09.374
<i>a dead body was cremated
under your supervision. Right?</i>

01:54:09.874 --> 01:54:13.665
On the morning of 9th May, 1909,
at the Darjeeling crematorium...

01:54:13.666 --> 01:54:19.041
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri's last rites
were performed under my supervision. Yes.

01:54:19.827 --> 01:54:21.207
That's what I said.

01:54:21.208 --> 01:54:23.290
But that's not the question.
The question is...

01:54:23.291 --> 01:54:24.790
Was Mahendra a practising Hindu?

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:27.332
Obviously, he was.
He was a Brahmin of the highest order.

01:54:27.333 --> 01:54:28.623
What kind of a question is this?

01:54:28.624 --> 01:54:32.832
Objection, My Lord.
The prosecution is wasting court's time.

01:54:32.833 --> 01:54:34.958
Overruled. Please carry on.

01:54:35.166 --> 01:54:38.099
So, a Hindu of the highest order.

01:54:38.604 --> 01:54:41.082
And we know
that he didn't have any children.

01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:43.040
Then, who performed the last rites? You?

01:54:43.041 --> 01:54:44.124
No...

01:54:44.416 --> 01:54:46.374
- What?!
- No! No!

01:54:46.583 --> 01:54:49.290
Okay. Was it a close relative?

01:54:49.291 --> 01:54:52.958
No, no one...
No one performed the ritual.

01:54:53.333 --> 01:54:58.082
Okay but do you remember the name of
the priest who presided over the ceremony?

01:54:58.083 --> 01:55:01.082
No priest was available...

01:55:01.083 --> 01:55:03.582
Your Honour, a lot of time had passed...

01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:06.832
We couldn't perform all the rites and rituals
according to the scriptures that day.

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:10.123
And the body was decomposing...
His lordship's body was...

01:55:10.124 --> 01:55:15.748
The body was washed, clarified butter
applied and new clothes were put on it...

01:55:15.749 --> 01:55:16.333
No...

01:55:16.334 --> 01:55:18.415
- What?!
- I said no...

01:55:18.416 --> 01:55:22.582
Didn't I just say no?
Didn't I? I said no.

01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:24.707
- Yes, you did...
- Yes, I did... I did!

01:55:24.708 --> 01:55:25.583
You did.

01:55:25.584 --> 01:55:29.540
You also said that the body was left
unsupervised for a long time.

01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:32.249
No one saw it at Darjeeling's Step Aside
or at the crematorium.

01:55:32.374 --> 01:55:33.707
You've also said...

01:55:33.708 --> 01:55:40.832
That Bengal's biggest estate holder's funeral
took place like a morgue's unclaimed body...

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:43.915
Or was it the unclaimed body from
the morgue that was cremated?

01:55:43.916 --> 01:55:45.583
Objection, My Lord!

01:55:46.083 --> 01:55:49.207
My learned friend, without any evidence...

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:51.498
purely based on guesswork...

01:55:51.499 --> 01:55:54.374
is bringing up false accusations
and confusing the witness.

01:55:54.458 --> 01:55:56.124
Sustained.

01:55:57.374 --> 01:55:59.207
Instead of false accusations...

01:55:59.208 --> 01:56:01.915
I would request the prosecution
to concentrate on hard evidence.

01:56:01.916 --> 01:56:03.499
Next witness.

01:56:03.749 --> 01:56:05.291
You're free to go.

01:56:07.874 --> 01:56:09.749
I'll call you again...

01:56:15.874 --> 01:56:19.666
I would like to call Dr. Ashwini Dasgupta
to the stand.

01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:29.749
My Lord, I would now like the court to
pay attention to evidence 245A.

01:56:29.958 --> 01:56:37.332
A prescription from Smith Stanistreet Pharmacy
dated 7th May. Just a day before Mahendra's death.

01:56:37.333 --> 01:56:41.665
Did you write this prescription, Ashwini?

01:56:41.666 --> 01:56:47.165
- No, this was written by Dr. Calvert?
- Look carefully... Who wrote it?

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:49.498
- Really?
- Dr. Calvert wrote it.

01:56:49.499 --> 01:56:54.083
And is the signature at the end
of the prescription yours?

01:56:54.998 --> 01:56:59.332
It was a long time ago...
I didn't quite remember...

01:56:59.333 --> 01:57:02.966
You can't remember?
Look carefully...

01:57:03.916 --> 01:57:05.415
Whose signature is this?

01:57:05.416 --> 01:57:13.416
I'm writing a high dosage
for both the medicines in the prescription.

01:57:13.458 --> 01:57:24.327
If we show both the prescriptions
then the actual ailment will be hidden.

01:57:25.124 --> 01:57:29.540
Yes, Dr. Calvert forced me to write it.

01:57:29.541 --> 01:57:34.748
Then why did Dr. Calvert deny this
at the London Commission?

01:57:34.749 --> 01:57:36.567
I don't know.

01:57:37.569 --> 01:57:38.415
You don't know.

01:57:38.416 --> 01:57:41.547
And whatever I am saying is the truth.

01:57:42.291 --> 01:57:44.373
- But you have no idea.
- No.

01:57:44.374 --> 01:57:48.791
Okay, then let's check
the facts that we have.

01:57:51.694 --> 01:57:54.207
Let's see the medicines
prescribed for Mahendra.

01:57:54.208 --> 01:57:57.123
Quinine sulphate which is deadly
for the stomach.

01:57:57.124 --> 01:58:00.665
Aloin, Enonymin which are strong laxatives.

01:58:00.822 --> 01:58:05.832
Nux vomica which has fatal Strychnine.
And the most dangerous Arsenic.

01:58:05.833 --> 01:58:08.040
We know what the patient
was suffering from.

01:58:08.041 --> 01:58:11.498
Blood loss, dysentery,
dehydration, anaemia...

01:58:11.499 --> 01:58:16.540
And we also know that each one of them
is a symptom of arsenic poisoning.

01:58:16.541 --> 01:58:17.291
I didn't kill him!

01:58:17.292 --> 01:58:18.916
<i>I didn't kill him!</i>

01:58:19.458 --> 01:58:25.547
Ashwini... Satya...

01:58:26.315 --> 01:58:30.498
Please don't give me any more injections.

01:58:30.499 --> 01:58:36.207
- Please let me go...
- Nothing will happen, my lord...

01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:39.165
- It's just a pin prick.
- No, no more...

01:58:39.166 --> 01:58:43.999
- Injection is the only way to administer...
- I don't want any injections...

01:58:44.291 --> 01:58:47.457
Please don't give me any more injections...

01:58:47.458 --> 01:58:51.540
Satya, my mother died
because of injections.

01:58:51.541 --> 01:58:53.707
I don't want to die...

01:58:53.708 --> 01:58:58.437
Forgive me, my lord.
But you're making a mistake.

01:58:59.856 --> 01:59:02.103
She died of cholera.

01:59:02.874 --> 01:59:05.755
She accidentally drank
some contaminated water.

01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:07.665
Not because of injections.

01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:12.369
See, it was cholera...

01:59:13.499 --> 01:59:15.983
Poison...

01:59:18.424 --> 01:59:20.989
I know this is poison.

01:59:25.874 --> 01:59:28.131
I am Mahendra.

01:59:31.764 --> 01:59:39.713
Give it to me...
I'll swallow it.

01:59:43.294 --> 01:59:49.752
Many kings have been poisoned
throughout history.

01:59:51.731 --> 01:59:53.938
Poison me too...

01:59:55.333 --> 02:00:02.981
Satya, no issues with that...
I'll drink it up...

02:00:03.717 --> 02:00:07.373
Give me the poison.
Ashwini...

02:00:07.374 --> 02:00:13.567
- Brother-in-law, please forgive me...
- I don't want injection...

02:00:14.335 --> 02:00:16.158
Please forgive me...

02:00:17.688 --> 02:00:25.175
My future... Chandra's future...
All the people who depend on you...

02:00:27.708 --> 02:00:30.956
I'll have to take responsibility
for everything.

02:00:32.083 --> 02:00:39.029
It'll be quicker if we inject.

02:00:40.253 --> 02:00:41.855
It won't hurt at all.

02:00:45.201 --> 02:00:46.360
Okay.

02:00:49.381 --> 02:00:56.699
Then, at least, stop this dysentery, Satya.

02:00:58.749 --> 02:01:05.390
I just want to leave this world
with some dignity.

02:01:06.302 --> 02:01:11.764
I'm a king... Satya... Satya...

02:01:12.583 --> 02:01:20.583
Ashwini, I beg of you...

02:01:21.999 --> 02:01:26.623
I made you a doctor, Ashwini.

02:01:26.624 --> 02:01:33.373
This dirty bed, this stench, this filth...
I can't...

02:01:33.749 --> 02:01:36.498
I am a king...

02:01:36.499 --> 02:01:40.290
Satya, I'm a king.
Let me die like one...

02:01:40.291 --> 02:01:42.248
Yes, yes, you're a king...

02:01:42.249 --> 02:01:47.540
- Please let me die like a king...
- Yes, a few more hours.

02:01:47.541 --> 02:01:49.623
Let me... Let me...

02:01:49.624 --> 02:01:51.957
- Please calm down.
- Please calm down...

02:01:51.958 --> 02:01:59.123
The blood letting is crucial along with dysentery.
The injection is going to make it quicker.

02:01:59.124 --> 02:01:59.916
Almost done.

02:01:59.917 --> 02:02:03.290
Lies! Lies! Lies! I'm innocent!
I didn't give him arsenic.

02:02:03.291 --> 02:02:05.832
You're lying.
I'm innocent!

02:02:05.833 --> 02:02:08.041
Objection, My Lord!

02:02:08.374 --> 02:02:12.123
Intimidation of the witness.

02:02:12.337 --> 02:02:15.290
My learned friend has forgotten
that this is a court of law.

02:02:15.291 --> 02:02:19.231
And he can't win the case
by shouting without reason here.

02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:23.207
What else can I do, My Lord?
This witness is lying through his teeth.

02:02:23.208 --> 02:02:29.998
Your Honour, this case is not about
what Satya or Ashwini did.

02:02:29.999 --> 02:02:32.248
This case is neither about murder.

02:02:32.249 --> 02:02:38.582
The court only wants to verify
the time of death...

02:02:38.583 --> 02:02:40.290
whether he was cremated...

02:02:40.291 --> 02:02:45.332
And the gentleman sitting here
is Bikrampur's Second Prince...

02:02:45.333 --> 02:02:49.123
Mahendra Chaudhuri or Punjab's Mal Singh.

02:02:49.531 --> 02:02:50.749
That's all.

02:02:51.916 --> 02:02:53.415
- Sustained.
- Thank you, My Lord.

02:02:53.416 --> 02:02:57.041
The court is hereby adjourned
till the next hearing.

02:02:57.766 --> 02:03:01.083
Memory can be tampered with, Your Honour.

02:03:01.249 --> 02:03:07.290
And we've also learnt from the Opposition
that letters can be forged.

02:03:07.291 --> 02:03:09.041
Even witnesses can be bought.

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:10.481
But Nature?

02:03:11.833 --> 02:03:14.291
That can't be denied, Your Honour.

02:03:15.124 --> 02:03:20.800
No one can change a birthmark,
physical characteristics, spots, wounds...

02:03:21.725 --> 02:03:28.516
The marks that Time creates on our bodies
separates us from others.

02:03:28.541 --> 02:03:31.249
Makes us unique... Makes us distinct.

02:03:31.374 --> 02:03:34.687
As unique as our fingerprints.

02:03:35.791 --> 02:03:41.354
That's why I demand a thorough
physical examination of my client.

02:03:41.874 --> 02:03:46.082
Although, my client and Raja Mahendra Kumar
Chaudhuri are similar looking.

02:03:46.083 --> 02:03:48.041
- Even then...
- Objection, My Lord.

02:03:48.083 --> 02:03:51.748
I want to remind the court
that when we were...

02:03:51.749 --> 02:03:54.915
trying to prove the identity of the
plaintiff as Punjab's Mal Singh...

02:03:54.916 --> 02:03:58.165
And that's why we minutely
compared a photograph...

02:03:58.166 --> 02:04:01.040
of Mahendra with the plaintiff.

02:04:01.041 --> 02:04:06.165
All the painters
and photographers observed that...

02:04:06.166 --> 02:04:07.083
It's the nose.

02:04:07.084 --> 02:04:09.957
The difference is maximum
in terms of the nose.

02:04:09.958 --> 02:04:12.665
Everything is similar except for the nose.

02:04:12.666 --> 02:04:14.082
The nose is a little different.

02:04:14.083 --> 02:04:17.415
Hence, it's obvious from the shape
of the nose that...

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:19.290
they are two different individuals.

02:04:19.291 --> 02:04:25.332
Then isn't this process poking one's nose
in matters of justice.

02:04:25.333 --> 02:04:27.540
We'll be wasting the
court's precious time...

02:04:27.541 --> 02:04:32.082
My Lord, my client has been waiting
for 27 years for his rights.

02:04:32.083 --> 02:04:35.082
Can't we spare 27 minutes for him?

02:04:35.083 --> 02:04:38.040
Is he waiting for 27
years for his rights...

02:04:38.041 --> 02:04:39.957
Or for a golden opportunity?

02:04:39.958 --> 02:04:41.332
But that time will tell.

02:04:41.333 --> 02:04:42.707
But you'll have to let time do the talking?

02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:45.207
If you keep gagging it with,
"Objection, My Lord"...

02:04:45.208 --> 02:04:47.040
How will it speak?

02:04:47.041 --> 02:04:49.290
Who knows better
than my learned friend here...

02:04:49.291 --> 02:04:51.207
to establish the truth...

02:04:51.208 --> 02:04:54.374
one must face a lot of
"Objection, My Lord."

02:04:54.624 --> 02:04:57.208
One has to work around the system.

02:05:01.647 --> 02:05:05.916
Order. Order.
Both of you, please calm down.

02:05:07.499 --> 02:05:10.708
I'll not tolerate this kind of behaviour
in my court.

02:05:12.624 --> 02:05:14.248
Sorry, Your Honour.

02:05:14.863 --> 02:05:17.187
I would like to call the plaintiff
to the stand.

02:05:17.333 --> 02:05:21.207
31 years ago,
on 5th March, 1905...

02:05:21.208 --> 02:05:24.165
Dr. Caddy of the insurance company
documented in details...

02:05:24.166 --> 02:05:28.415
a list of the marks and wounds on the
body that I'll now present to the Court.

02:05:28.416 --> 02:05:32.584
My Lord, before the doctors check,
may we hear the list first?

02:05:36.124 --> 02:05:37.998
Complexion, pink and white.

02:05:37.999 --> 02:05:39.582
Brownish wavy hair.

02:05:39.583 --> 02:05:41.873
<i>Moustache, lighter than hair.</i>

02:05:41.874 --> 02:05:42.998
<i>Brownish eyes.</i>

02:05:42.999 --> 02:05:45.708
<i>Fleshy growth below the right eye.</i>

02:05:45.833 --> 02:05:48.291
<i>Twist on the right lower lip.</i>

02:05:48.624 --> 02:05:50.998
<i>Ears at a sharp angle at the rim.</i>

02:05:51.399 --> 02:05:54.041
<i>With lobes,
not adherant to the cheek.</i>

02:05:54.083 --> 02:05:56.124
<i>Prominent Adam's apple.</i>

02:05:56.166 --> 02:05:58.958
<i>Broken left upper first molar tooth.</i>

02:05:59.124 --> 02:06:00.498
<i>Scales on the right hand.</i>

02:06:00.499 --> 02:06:03.373
<i>Irregular scar on top of the left ankle.</i>

02:06:03.374 --> 02:06:05.873
<i>Tiger claw marks on the right arm.</i>

02:06:05.874 --> 02:06:09.333
And a small mole on the dorsum
of the penis.

02:06:09.583 --> 02:06:11.374
All yours, Doctors.

02:07:09.541 --> 02:07:12.624
My Lord, we've checked for all the points
in the list.

02:07:13.499 --> 02:07:15.291
This individual...

02:07:15.791 --> 02:07:17.833
has all the marks on his body.

02:07:18.874 --> 02:07:20.748
Every single feature matched.

02:07:20.749 --> 02:07:22.290
Every single scar...

02:07:22.291 --> 02:07:30.291
Long live
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri!

02:07:32.374 --> 02:07:36.333
I've considered the whole evidence
in the case...

02:07:36.541 --> 02:07:38.415
with utmost care.

02:07:38.416 --> 02:07:42.832
<i>The very able arguments of learned counsels
on either side...</i>

02:07:42.833 --> 02:07:47.165
<i>have missed, I believe, nothing material
that could be urged...</i>

02:07:47.166 --> 02:07:50.748
<i>for or against the vital factor
of identity.</i>

02:07:50.749 --> 02:07:54.123
<i>There has been evidence
of honest men and women...</i>

02:07:54.124 --> 02:07:57.165
<i>of all ranks and conditions of life.</i>

02:07:57.166 --> 02:08:00.040
<i>Including, nearly all the relations...</i>

02:08:00.041 --> 02:08:05.582
<i>And among them, the sister, the First Queen
and Second Queen's own aunt...</i>

02:08:05.583 --> 02:08:07.248
<i>and her own cousin.</i>

02:08:07.249 --> 02:08:10.248
<i>There were inconclusive weather reports...</i>

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:12.082
<i>Mysterious prescriptions...</i>

02:08:12.083 --> 02:08:15.165
<i>And conflicting entries
and testimonies.</i>

02:08:15.166 --> 02:08:21.333
<i>There were solid financial motives for
Satya, Ashwini and the Court of Wards...</i>

02:08:21.374 --> 02:08:23.498
<i>to prove him to be an imposter.</i>

02:08:23.499 --> 02:08:27.540
<i>And lack of solid financial
or otherwise motives...</i>

02:08:27.541 --> 02:08:33.415
<i>for peasants, tenants, strangers
standing by their erstwhile feudal lord.</i>

02:08:33.416 --> 02:08:36.582
<i>But the conclusive, clinching criterion...</i>

02:08:36.583 --> 02:08:39.915
<i>was the mathematical certainty
of the bodily marks.</i>

02:08:39.916 --> 02:08:42.540
<i>And the cent percent matching.</i>

02:08:42.541 --> 02:08:44.040
<i>Hence, I find...</i>

02:08:44.041 --> 02:08:48.123
<i>the plaintiff to be
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.</i>

02:08:48.124 --> 02:08:51.874
<i>The Second Prince of Bikrampur.</i>

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:56.958
We won! We won!

02:08:57.041 --> 02:09:05.041
Long live
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri!

02:09:26.912 --> 02:09:28.791
Congratulations for now!

02:09:28.916 --> 02:09:34.624
A disgusting man got away because of you
for the time being.

02:09:35.819 --> 02:09:38.541
But they'll appeal to High Court.

02:09:38.874 --> 02:09:40.833
I'm only an agent.

02:09:41.416 --> 02:09:45.373
Destiny has picked him up from the funeral
pyre and given him a second chance.

02:09:45.374 --> 02:09:47.082
Who are we to stop him?

02:09:47.192 --> 02:09:48.787
How touching!

02:09:49.666 --> 02:09:55.291
If only Mr. Destiny had a bit of sympathy
for Chandraboti...

02:09:55.499 --> 02:09:58.833
the poor girl could have got
a second chance...

02:09:59.083 --> 02:10:01.749
at leading a normal life.

02:10:02.208 --> 02:10:10.070
But no matter what the grammar books say,
Destiny will always be a man.

02:10:11.791 --> 02:10:14.022
Not everyone gets
a second chance, Anupama.

02:10:16.124 --> 02:10:17.874
Like your client.

02:10:19.083 --> 02:10:20.624
Like me.

02:10:20.874 --> 02:10:24.708
Not everyone deserves
a second chance, Bhaskar.

02:10:25.249 --> 02:10:28.208
Like your client, like you.

02:10:29.583 --> 02:10:31.353
I know...

02:10:31.833 --> 02:10:35.541
I used our relationship as an excuse
to stop you from practising law.

02:10:36.066 --> 02:10:39.416
I know if I didn't stop you that day...

02:10:40.416 --> 02:10:41.994
you could have been the first
female barrister of India

02:10:42.019 --> 02:10:44.096
instead of Cornelia Sohrabjee.

02:10:45.416 --> 02:10:46.749
I know.

02:10:48.124 --> 02:10:52.249
But even a murder convict
gets a fair hearing.

02:10:52.958 --> 02:10:55.291
What can I do, my learned friend?

02:10:55.416 --> 02:10:59.166
You don't deserve to be either a friend
or a husband.

02:10:59.797 --> 02:11:01.797
Anyway, good bye.

02:11:02.416 --> 02:11:03.999
We'll meet again.

02:11:04.333 --> 02:11:05.416
Right.

02:11:05.541 --> 02:11:07.083
See you in court.

02:11:13.833 --> 02:11:21.124
<i>The way rains touch the earth</i>

02:11:21.249 --> 02:11:27.999
<i>The way rains touch the earth</i>

02:11:28.249 --> 02:11:36.249
<i>The way the Morning star shines
in the night's heart</i>

02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:40.373
<i>And life flows on</i>

02:11:40.374 --> 02:11:48.374
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

02:11:54.916 --> 02:12:02.916
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

02:12:06.166 --> 02:12:14.166
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

02:12:17.416 --> 02:12:20.498
<i>Forget all your doubts in
the rhythm of the music</i>

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:23.290
<i>The door is open, no more delay</i>

02:12:23.291 --> 02:12:31.291
<i>Hey beautiful, come join the festivities</i>

02:12:34.874 --> 02:12:39.249
Hence I find Justice Basu's judgement...

02:12:39.291 --> 02:12:43.623
rigourously and impeccably derived
from the available evidence.

02:12:43.624 --> 02:12:47.748
And have no reason to uphold the appeal
by Rani Chandraboti.

02:12:47.749 --> 02:12:50.207
So, in my opinion therefore...

02:12:50.208 --> 02:12:52.623
the appeal should be
dismissed with costs.

02:12:52.624 --> 02:12:57.333
And the verdict of the learned trial Judge
should be upheld.

02:12:58.291 --> 02:13:06.291
Long live
Raja Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri!

02:13:07.708 --> 02:13:13.957
Hence I'm inclined to believe that the
plaintiff is a Punjabi named Mal Singh.

02:13:13.958 --> 02:13:15.972
He had failed utterly
to prove affirmatively

02:13:15.996 --> 02:13:18.891
that he is Mahendra Kumar Chaudhuri.

02:13:18.916 --> 02:13:22.310
I'm satisfied therefore
that he is an imposter

02:13:22.334 --> 02:13:24.953
supported by Mrinmoyee Devi and others.

02:13:25.041 --> 02:13:28.873
In my opinion, therefore,
an appeal should be allowed with costs.

02:13:28.874 --> 02:13:32.248
The judgement and the decree of the
original court should be set aside...

02:13:32.249 --> 02:13:35.041
and the suit should
be dismissed with costs.

02:13:38.291 --> 02:13:40.791
The game has just begun.

02:13:59.166 --> 02:14:02.291
This case is beyond a doubt...

02:14:02.458 --> 02:14:06.498
one of the most interesting
and remarkable...

02:14:06.499 --> 02:14:09.457
that has ever come
before a court of law...

02:14:09.458 --> 02:14:12.749
in this country or indeed any other.

02:14:13.791 --> 02:14:17.082
<i>A case which it is no
exaggeration to say...</i>

02:14:17.083 --> 02:14:20.124
<i>is unique in legal annals.</i>

02:14:20.583 --> 02:14:23.582
Before the case,
I would, however, like to comment...

02:14:23.583 --> 02:14:27.374
on the nature of the country
called India.

02:14:27.833 --> 02:14:32.373
<i>India knows her men, women,
rivers, mountains...</i>

02:14:32.374 --> 02:14:37.832
<i>history, traditions and emotions
better than any Englishman.</i>

02:14:37.833 --> 02:14:43.958
<i>So, it's time that we trust her
to take her own decisions.</i>

02:15:22.708 --> 02:15:25.041
How are you, Chandra?

02:15:25.208 --> 02:15:27.416
I'm... I'm fine...

02:15:28.458 --> 02:15:29.499
And you?

02:15:30.309 --> 02:15:32.998
I am... well...

02:15:34.083 --> 02:15:35.624
I am real...

02:15:36.963 --> 02:15:37.708
not a fake husband...

02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:40.333
You've never had a husband, Chandra...

02:15:41.041 --> 02:15:44.374
Just a master with disgusting boils
from syphilis.

02:15:44.791 --> 02:15:47.998
Is there a reason to feel elated
when a man like this comes back?

02:15:47.999 --> 02:15:50.833
There's no reason to hang him either.

02:15:51.499 --> 02:15:53.374
Like some people we know...

02:15:53.791 --> 02:15:56.498
he hasn't murdered anyone
neither has he attempted murder.

02:15:56.499 --> 02:15:58.624
- Minu...
- He has never betrayed anyone...

02:15:58.688 --> 02:16:01.291
He has never tried to cheat
the man who provided for him.

02:16:01.458 --> 02:16:06.166
The disgusting boils of syphilis
can be treated, Satya but...

02:16:07.041 --> 02:16:09.290
a poisonous heart and a weak spine
can't be fixed.

02:16:09.291 --> 02:16:12.958
It'll be better if neither one of you spoke
of deception.

02:16:13.374 --> 02:16:17.291
And don't forget the
Privy Council in London.

02:16:17.958 --> 02:16:19.915
And even if we lose there...

02:16:19.916 --> 02:16:22.790
There's another Judge above all of us.

02:16:22.791 --> 02:16:26.333
He has His own court, lawyers, records...

02:16:26.541 --> 02:16:30.127
He will punish Falsehood.
He surely will.

02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:34.208
Let's go, Chandra.

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:41.291
Wait...

02:16:43.249 --> 02:16:44.499
Let's go... Let's go...

02:17:12.458 --> 02:17:14.374
Brother...

02:17:17.249 --> 02:17:20.874
I just got the news...

02:17:21.291 --> 02:17:24.791
They had appealed to the Privy Council.

02:17:25.333 --> 02:17:29.124
What a surprise!
What happened?

02:17:29.708 --> 02:17:30.416
The case...

02:17:30.417 --> 02:17:31.958
Tell us what happened?

02:17:34.291 --> 02:17:35.833
We've won.

02:17:36.096 --> 02:17:37.570
By God's grace!

02:18:00.249 --> 02:18:06.598
You've been away from home
for the last 37 years, brother.

02:18:12.124 --> 02:18:18.271
Let's go back...
Let's go home...

02:18:18.583 --> 02:18:22.333
Before that tomorrow, we should offer
our prayers to Goddess Kali...

02:18:52.541 --> 02:18:55.583
What is it, brother?

02:18:56.041 --> 02:18:58.045
Nothing...

02:19:10.708 --> 02:19:16.374
How did you hear him through
the howling wind and storm?

02:19:23.166 --> 02:19:28.083
You were looking for salvation
but instead you found a fortune, right?

02:19:29.749 --> 02:19:32.749
It's not your time yet...

02:19:33.083 --> 02:19:36.208
You'll know when the time is right.

02:19:39.458 --> 02:19:42.165
There's another Judge above all of us.

02:19:42.166 --> 02:19:45.338
He has His own court, lawyers, records...

02:19:45.846 --> 02:19:48.208
He will punish Falsehood.

02:19:48.499 --> 02:19:54.165
<i>Who are you? Who am I?
Where have we come from?</i>

02:19:54.166 --> 02:19:59.833
<i>Who is my mother?
Who is my father?</i>

02:19:59.874 --> 02:20:11.061
<i>Renounce this dreamlike world
And achieve enlightenment</i>

02:20:17.124 --> 02:20:22.873
<i>Thousands of past lives
Like birth marks</i>

02:20:22.874 --> 02:20:28.124
<i>Glow like the stars</i>

02:20:28.541 --> 02:20:34.290
<i>I don't remember who I was</i>

02:20:34.291 --> 02:20:39.916
<i>The Milky Way becomes my body</i>

02:20:39.999 --> 02:20:44.749
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:20:45.583 --> 02:20:50.874
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:20:51.416 --> 02:20:56.916
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:20:57.166 --> 02:21:02.458
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:21:02.874 --> 02:21:08.540
<i>Who are you? Who am I?
Where have we come from?</i>

02:21:08.541 --> 02:21:14.373
<i>Who is my mother?
Who is my father?</i>

02:21:14.374 --> 02:21:25.242
<i>Renounce this dreamlike world
And achieve enlightenment</i>

02:21:31.499 --> 02:21:37.041
<i>Am I who I am?
Or is it someone else?</i>

02:21:37.249 --> 02:21:42.873
<i>The same face
But different addresses</i>

02:21:42.874 --> 02:21:45.623
<i>The way I was created from the elements</i>

02:21:45.624 --> 02:21:53.624
<i>I will dissipate in to the elements</i>

02:21:54.208 --> 02:21:59.374
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:22:00.083 --> 02:22:05.541
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:22:05.791 --> 02:22:10.791
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:22:11.291 --> 02:22:16.749
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:22:22.791 --> 02:22:30.791
<i>Whether you remember or forget
Life waits for you to return</i>

02:22:34.249 --> 02:22:42.249
<i>Watch the light changing direction
In the cosmos every moment</i>

02:22:45.749 --> 02:22:49.499
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:22:51.458 --> 02:22:55.749
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:22:57.166 --> 02:23:02.291
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:23:02.833 --> 02:23:07.458
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:48.281
<i>Every life grants me a brand new day.</i>

02:23:48.656 --> 02:23:52.936
<i>I find myself in day old dates.</i>

02:23:54.379 --> 02:23:59.941
<i>So many people have walked down this road.</i>

02:24:00.023 --> 02:24:04.785
<i>Their stories sound just like mine.</i>

02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:09.987
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:24:11.534 --> 02:24:16.914
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:24:17.198 --> 02:24:21.230
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:24:22.946 --> 02:24:27.330
<i>Who am I?
Where is my place?</i>

02:24:28.642 --> 02:24:34.204
<i>Who are you? Who am I?
Where have we come from?</i>

02:24:34.228 --> 02:24:40.178
<i>Who is my mother?
Who is my father?</i>

02:24:40.203 --> 02:24:51.025
 <i>Renounce this dreamlike world
And achieve enlightenment</i>
