WEBVTT

00:01:48.422 --> 00:01:53.323
Birinchi Maharaj is great.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:57.967
Birinchi Maharaj is great!

00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:28.380
Where from?

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.178
We are returning from Debraj.

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:35.643
Kashi!
- Yes.

00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:39.115
Haven't been there in a long time.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.018
Oh! Your work was in Kashi...

00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:47.223
Too crowded.

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:49.887
That is true. But still...

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:53.763
I had said at the very start
you have created a great city,

00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:57.898
but will it remain like it is?

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:01.510
So many storms will blow over it,

00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:05.010
so many will come and go.

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:12.860
One day, Sankar came to me
and said,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.865
even if you don't follow
the philosophy of One God,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.310
don't you agree that Gautam
caused a lot of destruction?

00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:22.000
Don't you think some action
should be taken for this?

00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:26.020
I said, if you want to,
then take action.

00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:30.603
If that's what will get you
peace of mind, then do it.

00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:36.302
But remember this that someone will
mess up your work as well some day.

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:39.972
Someone will play football with
your religion. Understand that well.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.293
That lad had something in him

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:49.178
but he could not master
the science of life.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:53.723
That's why, at the age of 32...

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.950
Wake up!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.180
Wake up!

00:04:45.398 --> 00:04:49.523
Wake up!

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:56.322
I don't have a moment of peace.

00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:59.350
I have to awaken this lad every
day from his sleep.

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:04.140
Baba.
- What happened?

00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:07.503
My mind is at unrest, Baba.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.847
What is your name?

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:13.642
My name is Guropodo Mitter.
Advocate.

00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:16.665
Come here, child.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:21.650
Touch his feet.

00:05:24.328 --> 00:05:25.363
Sit.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.675
This is my younger daughter, Baba.
Her name is Buchki. I mean, Neelima.

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:35.532
Her mother died last year.

00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:39.688
Since then, Baba,
there has been no peace.

00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:44.822
I've visited Kashi
and Vrindavan but

00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:48.240
still I cannot find
the strength to go on.

00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:52.600
Cannot find the strength?
- No, Baba.

00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:56.482
It's as if there's no pillar left
for support.

00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:05.225
Hold this!

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:10.740
Hold it tight.

00:06:11.983 --> 00:06:18.648
What? Is there any unrest left?
Is there any sadness left?

00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:21.362
Do you feel the spirit?
Any tiredness?

00:06:21.387 --> 00:06:24.185
Any emptiness left?
Any restrictions left?

00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:34.455
It's fate.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.003
Oh, God!

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.917
Oh God.
- What happened?

00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:49.062
Nitai?

00:06:49.802 --> 00:06:52.515
If only I could find a good Babaji,

00:06:53.088 --> 00:06:55.655
I'd leave everything
and go with him.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.968
Why?

00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:06.735
You've lost interest in the world?

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.873
Mind is at unrest, brother.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.082
Life has sped by. At home,
the wife keeps complaining.

00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:19.015
At the office, there's a new boss.

00:07:19.285 --> 00:07:22.710
He is also... It's all rubbish!
Nothing feels good.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.143
If you know of any such man,
let me know.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.032
There's no Babaji
in your fate, Nitai.

00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:31.710
Your constant chatter
has made me lose my knight.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.132
You know, in spiritual matters,

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:36.805
talking less
is a primary condition.

00:07:40.577 --> 00:07:43.310
This young man
is an insurance agent.

00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:46.783
And to top it,
he can do Hatha Yoga.

00:07:47.128 --> 00:07:49.993
So, why can't I find
myself a Babaji?

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:54.220
My case is intellectual.
You will not understand that.

00:07:56.788 --> 00:08:00.303
It can only be understood
by Paramadha Chatterjee.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.453
Are you in the habit of
chewing green chillies?

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.333
Nitai.

00:08:23.492 --> 00:08:24.815
Yes?

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:28.725
A sage has come to Jagganath Ghat.
Understand?

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:30.730
He's called Mirchai Baba.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.545
People visiting him are being
offered enchanted green chillies

00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:41.172
and after eating them,
all their illness is cured.

00:08:44.543 --> 00:08:46.220
Will a Radio Baba work?

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.885
Swami Taritananda!

00:08:49.222 --> 00:08:53.018
This Baba has two 'tives'.
One negative, one positive.

00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:58.405
Drains electricity from the sky
and sparks it to people. - Really?

00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:01.865
You go to him and you
will be cured of all disease.

00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:05.228
Electrotherapy!

00:09:08.992 --> 00:09:13.672
My disease is just one.
Lack of money.

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:18.385
Let him find a nice
source of income for me

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.912
and I'll accept that he's great!

00:09:20.978 --> 00:09:23.033
That too, he can do.
- He can?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.030
He will take you to a place for a
day, before the battle in 1914.

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:32.652
Then?

00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:36.248
You will buy some iron.
- Iron?

00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:40.288
Yes. For cheap.
- Then?

00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:44.743
For cheap.
- Then?

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:51.308
After that, you...
- After that, what?

00:09:54.183 --> 00:09:58.607
After 1914 what happened?

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.332
Mate in two moves, brother.

00:10:01.483 --> 00:10:03.360
What happened after 1914?

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:06.135
After 1914, he brings you
back to '65.

00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:08.162
With the iron?
- Yes, of course.

00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:10.453
And then you sell the iron
at the current rate.

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:14.050
Current rate?

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.803
Nibaran.

00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:20.190
What?
- Disaster!

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.062
Sit.
- 400 rupees, 500 rupees.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.588
600 rupees. 700 rupees.

00:10:26.148 --> 00:10:28.927
Speak thee not!
- I have done it, brother.

00:10:29.017 --> 00:10:31.617
Narendrapur - five acres of land.
Three houses.

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:33.698
Now all I need to do
is find the Babaji.

00:10:33.788 --> 00:10:36.713
Again Babaji?
- Chess is an intellectual game.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.945
This kind of pandemonium
does not go with it.

00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:42.868
He's destroyed everything.

00:10:43.023 --> 00:10:45.327
Buchki is getting an induction.
- What?

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:47.568
Buchki is getting an induction.

00:10:47.658 --> 00:10:49.445
Some Babaji has inducted her father

00:10:49.535 --> 00:10:51.618
and now the daughter
will also get it.

00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:55.048
Did you go to their place? - Yes,
that's where I'm coming from.

00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:57.420
So is this good news or bad news?

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.008
Getting inducted into priesthood
is good news?

00:10:59.098 --> 00:11:01.650
Why not? I too would get inducted
if I found a good sage.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.547
But I was to propose to her!

00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:06.518
So you propose...
- No, Nitai.

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:09.663
You do not know
the background to this story,

00:11:10.028 --> 00:11:14.385
and so you don't understand
the reason for Satta's anxiety.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.915
You need a little introduction.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:27.257
This Buchki is Alipore lawyer,
Guropodo Mitter's younger daughter.

00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:31.980
Mr Mitter's wife, Soudamini,
was Takdar Shashi Ghosh's daughter.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.780
Is that so?
- Yes.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.455
She died a year or two ago.

00:11:38.258 --> 00:11:42.598
I know them through my childhood
friend from Bagbazar,

00:11:42.623 --> 00:11:45.733
the famous Professor Nani.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.627
Nani's wife is Mr Mitter's
eldest daughter, Nirupama.

00:11:50.717 --> 00:11:53.593
Fine.
- It was in Nirupama's house

00:11:53.852 --> 00:11:57.700
that Master Satta
first met Lady Buchki.

00:11:57.987 --> 00:12:01.255
It was love at first sight
and since then,

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:03.640
he's contemplating marriage.

00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:07.880
Clear?
- Clear.

00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:13.595
So the point is, Master Satta
has fallen in love with Lady Buchki

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:17.790
but Lady Buchki wants to get
inducted into priesthood.

00:12:17.947 --> 00:12:21.672
Hence, the matter is very serious.
- Exactly.

00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:24.280
Satta, carry on.

00:12:24.972 --> 00:12:27.238
Fatik, get some tea.

00:12:27.457 --> 00:12:30.810
They returned from Kashi yesterday.

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:34.713
I would have visited them
yesterday but at the laundry,

00:12:34.803 --> 00:12:40.007
my bloody pants were not ready
so I had to wait for one day.

00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:45.282
So then, today, at around eight in
the morning, I went to their place.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:49.225
On reaching it, I noticed
that the place seemed strange.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.297
The guards were all huddled
together and talking.

00:12:52.533 --> 00:12:54.278
The usual Radio Ceylon was not
playing.

00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:55.788
Everything seemed different.

00:12:56.435 --> 00:12:59.548
Anyway, I entered the house
and was going up the stairs

00:12:59.638 --> 00:13:01.377
when someone called me from behind.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.702
I turned and who do I see?
Ganesh Mama! - Satta.

00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:06.240
Wait a minute! Who is Ganesh Mama?

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:09.638
Ganesh Mama
is Mr Mitter's brother-in-law.

00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:13.382
Lady Buchki's uncle. Clear?
- Clear.

00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:15.358
And then?

00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.408
Buchki is not there?

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:21.425
She is. But there is work
going on upstairs.

00:13:21.515 --> 00:13:23.722
Buchki's father is getting inducted
into priesthood.

00:13:23.812 --> 00:13:27.362
Priesthood? - Why should the word
priesthood make you smile like that?

00:13:27.588 --> 00:13:29.675
Do you know his guru
is a great and learned man?

00:13:29.873 --> 00:13:33.110
He's been around since the time
the town of Kashi was constructed.

00:13:33.263 --> 00:13:36.300
Which Kashi?
- Kashi Benaras. Nut Kashi Khu Khu.

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:38.552
Oh, God! Is he into black magic
of some sort?

00:13:38.642 --> 00:13:40.993
No, he's not into black magic
but he's a Democrat, for sure.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:43.735
You are a hardcore communist.
Now move along.

00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:46.953
Communist? - Yes. I've heard you go
out on protest marches on the roads.

00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:48.867
Oh that...
- No.

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:51.870
You better leave today.
Come some other day to meet them.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.732
But...
- Leave.

00:13:58.183 --> 00:14:00.700
Your son-in-law is well, I hope.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.503
Has he got a job?
He was looking for one, wasn't he?

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.943
Listen!

00:14:10.648 --> 00:14:11.755
You called me from behind?

00:14:11.845 --> 00:14:13.748
Do you know of any job or what?

00:14:13.838 --> 00:14:17.935
I do know of something but he
must be trying elsewhere.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.767
No. Nowadays nothing can happen
without a little backing.

00:14:20.857 --> 00:14:24.002
But Uncle, in case of backing,
what of his self-respect...

00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:27.788
You cannot understand, Sattaranjan.
Today's day and age is different.

00:14:27.878 --> 00:14:30.885
Go up and meet everyone quickly.
Then come and give me the details.

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:33.697
Yes, then, I'll quickly...
- Yes, quickly.

00:14:34.553 --> 00:14:36.930
You wait.
I'll take just five minutes or so.

00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:49.463
Hey.

00:14:52.565 --> 00:14:53.548
Hey.

00:15:26.732 --> 00:15:28.658
Hey. Buchki.

00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:32.148
Are you calling me?
- What's the matter?

00:15:33.107 --> 00:15:36.480
What is this induction all about?
Your house has completely changed.

00:15:37.108 --> 00:15:40.247
I'm also getting inducted.
- Buchki.

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:43.013
Didn't you get my letter?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.090
Your letter?
- I wrote to you in Benaras.

00:15:46.493 --> 00:15:48.537
Was that you?

00:15:48.768 --> 00:15:51.320
A seven line letter! Of that,
two lines were from Shelley.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.033
Two lines from Chandidas
and two lines of a poem.

00:15:54.355 --> 00:15:56.658
Other than that, all it said was,
How are you? I'm fine!

00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:00.520
But believe me,
the feeling behind it all is mine.

00:16:00.743 --> 00:16:02.957
Keep your feelings to yourself.
- Listen.

00:16:03.047 --> 00:16:04.963
I have work.
- I need to talk.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.300
We'll see after I'm inducted.

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.927
Then?
- Then what?

00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:16.455
I left the place.

00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:21.185
Nibaran, you have to help me.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.160
You deliver quotations
instead of love letters

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.113
and I must rescue you.

00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:31.330
No, I can handle that part of it.
You just remove this Babaji.

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.378
What if this person is genuine?

00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:39.485
So, you think he is genuine, Parak?

00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:42.540
I have an open mind.

00:16:42.927 --> 00:16:45.645
If he appeals to your intelligence,
that's great. Otherwise, reject him.

00:16:45.735 --> 00:16:47.943
Could we meet
and interview this Babaji?

00:16:48.033 --> 00:16:50.633
Does he sit at any place?
- I don't know.

00:16:51.838 --> 00:16:55.678
Did you see Buchki's sister?
Was she there?

00:16:56.155 --> 00:16:57.498
Yes. She was.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.798
Then... One...

00:17:08.765 --> 00:17:11.178
How old is this Babaji? 2,000?

00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:15.200
Oh God! Paramadha.

00:17:15.728 --> 00:17:19.802
Sell him an insurance policy.
You will get many premiums.

00:17:21.488 --> 00:17:24.613
Hello? Is that Putli?

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.150
Is your father there? No?

00:17:28.738 --> 00:17:34.005
Mother there? Put your mother on.
Say Uncle Nibaran is calling.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.217
He was talking about the days
when Kashi was born, right?

00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:40.485
Maybe he was talking about rebirth.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.590
After all, he is a
type of an astrologer.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.697
Is that sister-in-law? Fine.
Where is your husband?

00:17:50.978 --> 00:17:53.113
Experimenting again?

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:59.090
Boiling grass? Why? Can't Nani
digest raw grass anymore?

00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:05.553
Here, protein synthesis
is taking place.

00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:08.915
The grass will get hydrolysed
and turn into carbohydrate.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.290
Then, if you leave
two amino groups,

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.738
you get hexahydroxidiamino.

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:16.553
What is this rubber pipe?

00:18:16.643 --> 00:18:18.923
Potli, play that once, my girl.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.458
Only bubbles?
- It's getting oxidized!

00:18:40.548 --> 00:18:42.742
Do come. The tea is getting cold.

00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:45.492
I thought music will flow
down the rubber pipe,

00:18:45.582 --> 00:18:49.285
mix with the grass and
create a fantastic green nectar.

00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:56.945
If I get successful with this,

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:59.807
I think lack of fo...

00:19:00.428 --> 00:19:01.680
Lack of food?
- Yes.

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:03.473
There will be no lack?
- That's right.

00:19:06.655 --> 00:19:07.918
Sister-in-law.

00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:11.833
Start practising how to chew.
Understood?

00:19:12.643 --> 00:19:17.095
Sure. What everybody does, I shall
too. What's the matter in that? Sit.

00:19:17.272 --> 00:19:19.943
Well, I haven't asked you
one thing, Nani.

00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:23.535
Will future humans walk
on two legs or four?

00:19:23.715 --> 00:19:26.433
The advantage of four legs is

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.328
speed?
- Speed.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.595
Two plus two.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.613
Sister-in-law,
tell me about this Baba!

00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:43.640
Who are you talking about?
Birinchibaba?

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.113
Is that his name?

00:19:46.758 --> 00:19:49.492
Potli! Keep a lookout on the grass.

00:19:49.582 --> 00:19:52.855
I am doing so, mother.
- Come.

00:19:53.898 --> 00:19:56.935
Tell me.
- What can all this be?

00:19:57.858 --> 00:20:00.565
I went home and saw that
my father was getting inducted.

00:20:01.828 --> 00:20:05.487
Since my mother died,
my father has changed.

00:20:07.228 --> 00:20:10.930
Stopped working.
Doesn't meet anyone.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.755
I thought that father's mind has...

00:20:15.502 --> 00:20:18.525
Anyway, now he has got Guruji.

00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:20.848
Guruji is everything.
- I guess so.

00:20:21.043 --> 00:20:24.150
So you are saying that this person
has kind of settled here.

00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:28.642
Something like a
semi-permanent settlement.

00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:32.033
Earlier, father was not
at all interested in religion.

00:20:32.503 --> 00:20:35.893
Something like what would happen
if you fall in love at an old age.

00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:39.310
Well, what is your view?
What do you make of it?

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.928
He speaks pretty well.
Sounds good to hear.

00:20:43.078 --> 00:20:47.015
Though I don't follow all he says.
Some relevity, felevity.

00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:49.452
Relativity.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.543
Yes, that.

00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:54.648
Nani, you went too?
- Why him?

00:20:54.738 --> 00:20:58.333
Lawyer, barrister
and people from every corner.

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.425
So many people have been
coming to hear him.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.960
Leonardo da Vinci.

00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:10.130
The man knows it all.
- Really?

00:21:10.865 --> 00:21:13.113
He's solved a lot of problems
in Czechoslovakia.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.000
Who? This Babaji?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.568
Einstein used to visit him.

00:21:17.823 --> 00:21:19.125
Visit him?
- Yes.

00:21:19.373 --> 00:21:21.210
He only taught him.
- What?

00:21:21.593 --> 00:21:25.760
Relativity. E=mc2

00:21:26.015 --> 00:21:27.770
Baba taught him?

00:21:29.193 --> 00:21:30.870
Taught Einstein?

00:21:31.943 --> 00:21:34.407
Is that what he said
in front of so many people?

00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:35.730
Yes.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.793
And people believed him?

00:21:41.123 --> 00:21:43.868
Everybody clapped.

00:21:45.403 --> 00:21:46.788
Goodness.

00:21:47.243 --> 00:21:49.498
Even you would have done the same.

00:21:49.932 --> 00:21:52.820
You tell me, how long
does a person live?

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.340
Why not ask the person
who knows all this?

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.338
Nani. - You tell me.
How long can a person live?

00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:01.505
Quite long, actually.
- How long?

00:22:01.595 --> 00:22:05.628
150? 200? - If it's 200,
then it's a tortoise.

00:22:07.315 --> 00:22:08.740
Not man?

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.255
Not a homo sapien.

00:22:11.523 --> 00:22:14.368
And 2,000?
- 1,000?

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.047
2,000. Could any man

00:22:17.137 --> 00:22:20.353
be alive since the construction
of Kashi?

00:22:21.135 --> 00:22:23.722
The tea is getting cold.
Why don't you drink it?

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.323
What happened? Can he?

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:29.408
His right-hand person
seems like a loafer.

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:32.368
What, Nani?
- Trees can.

00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:34.465
Not homo sapiens.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.308
Tree. Bo Tree?

00:22:39.578 --> 00:22:43.058
Buddha's tree of enlightenment.
Remember?

00:22:45.152 --> 00:22:49.213
You are a scientist. He said
all this nonsense about Einstein

00:22:49.303 --> 00:22:51.150
in front of you
and you didn't expose him?

00:22:52.378 --> 00:22:54.072
And you're laughing?

00:22:55.035 --> 00:22:57.930
What's the use, my friend?
In the end, he'll accuse me

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.917
of causing trouble
because I'm after his property.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.513
But it's interesting.
- What?

00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:09.000
He showed us something.
Come forward. I'll tell you.

00:23:09.615 --> 00:23:12.720
This is the present.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.178
Where?
- Here.

00:23:14.558 --> 00:23:16.108
At this contact point.
- Okay.

00:23:16.198 --> 00:23:18.445
And this right hand

00:23:19.735 --> 00:23:23.803
is rotating clockwise.

00:23:25.313 --> 00:23:26.848
Future.
- All right.

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:29.472
And this.
- Anticlockwise.

00:23:29.623 --> 00:23:33.568
Anticlockwise. The past.
- Okay.

00:23:33.658 --> 00:23:35.430
He made both of them
move at the same time.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.180
At the same time?
- At the same time.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.450
In opposite directions?
- In opposite directions.

00:23:40.912 --> 00:23:42.768
So he says that
there is nothing like

00:23:42.793 --> 00:23:44.647
the present because
time does not stop.

00:23:52.757 --> 00:23:54.040
Difficult.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.090
Sister-in-law, can you do it?
Try it.

00:23:59.328 --> 00:24:00.745
Let me try.

00:24:01.283 --> 00:24:02.793
Yes, try!

00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:07.600
If he can't do it,
how will I be able to do it? No.

00:24:18.178 --> 00:24:20.070
Listen.
- To what?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.378
The voice of the Babaji.

00:24:41.727 --> 00:24:45.857
Time is a very strange thing.

00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:50.570
Time is a very strange thing.

00:24:50.985 --> 00:24:55.433
It is said people are here today
but not there tomorrow.

00:24:55.692 --> 00:24:59.502
I say, you're there tomorrow
but not here today.

00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:03.437
Tomorrow. This means time.

00:25:04.043 --> 00:25:06.698
Tomorrow is there.

00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:10.758
But today, the present

00:25:10.998 --> 00:25:16.465
does not exist. How can it exist?

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:19.538
How can it exist?

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:25.765
Time is constantly moving.

00:25:25.855 --> 00:25:30.113
It does not stay at one place.

00:25:30.292 --> 00:25:33.142
So how could you label
it as the present,

00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:35.918
tie chains around
its leg and hold it

00:25:36.008 --> 00:25:40.685
and say this is the present?

00:25:42.383 --> 00:25:44.988
The moment the words end,

00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:48.730
it becomes happened.

00:25:49.113 --> 00:25:53.560
Or has happened. Or had happened.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.130
All this means the past.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.167
Something that has gone.

00:26:00.373 --> 00:26:03.470
The past!
- The past!

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.248
The past!
- The past!

00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:09.102
The past!
- The past!

00:26:10.732 --> 00:26:15.370
On this, I had verbal
arguments with Plato.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.450
Who is he talking about?

00:26:17.693 --> 00:26:19.857
Plato, the great Roman astrologer.

00:26:19.947 --> 00:26:22.283
Astrologer!
- Plato said,

00:26:22.605 --> 00:26:25.477
Inhuman logas cognosis.

00:26:25.953 --> 00:26:29.153
I cannot understand
what you are saying.

00:26:29.303 --> 00:26:31.695
I cannot understand
what you are saying.

00:26:33.062 --> 00:26:35.840
Dictos jargon paranois.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.813
You are talking gibberish.

00:26:43.508 --> 00:26:46.465
I said, well, fine then,

00:26:47.048 --> 00:26:49.135
if you cannot understand...

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.665
If you cannot understand
what I'm saying,

00:26:52.848 --> 00:26:55.350
then I'll do a demonstration
for you.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.753
Plato said, oh my God,
what demonstration!

00:26:59.232 --> 00:27:01.715
He was quite scared of me.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.327
I said, why are you getting
scared, Plato?

00:27:05.417 --> 00:27:08.113
It's very simple. Look at this.

00:27:08.843 --> 00:27:13.115
This is my right hand.
This, my finger.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.915
Now, this starts rotating
on the right side, clockwise.

00:27:18.218 --> 00:27:22.673
Meaning, in the direction
where time goes.

00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:26.652
And where does time go?
Towards the future.

00:27:28.208 --> 00:27:33.585
And, this is my left hand.
This rotates on the left side.

00:27:34.222 --> 00:27:39.763
Anticlockwise. Signifying the past.

00:27:39.853 --> 00:27:44.570
The past.
- And now, they rotate together.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.670
Front and back.

00:28:03.558 --> 00:28:05.962
This is life.

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:10.485
What was there. What will happen.

00:28:11.578 --> 00:28:14.285
That's what it is.

00:28:15.728 --> 00:28:19.188
Past and future.

00:28:19.818 --> 00:28:22.453
The world lies between these two.

00:28:23.733 --> 00:28:25.090
Outside!

00:28:26.432 --> 00:28:28.147
Outside.

00:28:29.815 --> 00:28:31.420
Come!

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.853
Sit at the back there, understood?

00:28:35.248 --> 00:28:37.643
Don't worry so much.
We'll go and sit.

00:28:38.045 --> 00:28:39.615
After all,
we must disinfect our minds,

00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:42.882
which are so filled with sins.

00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:47.793
Come!

00:29:00.915 --> 00:29:02.860
Quickly, go and finish
the blessing part.

00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:04.447
Me?

00:29:04.537 --> 00:29:06.168
Yes, not another word. Go ahead.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.547
My Lord!

00:29:25.125 --> 00:29:26.383
Who is it?

00:29:27.843 --> 00:29:29.330
It's me.

00:29:30.278 --> 00:29:32.098
You look familiar.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.570
Where have I seen you before?
- Me?

00:29:35.758 --> 00:29:39.183
In Nepal? Have I seen you in Nepal?
- I stay on Serpentine Lane.

00:29:39.273 --> 00:29:42.012
What's your name!

00:29:42.102 --> 00:29:44.662
Sattaranjan Sarkar.

00:29:44.828 --> 00:29:47.665
Sattaranjan!

00:29:47.845 --> 00:29:50.335
Sattaranjan!

00:29:55.052 --> 00:29:56.903
Yes! Murshidabad.

00:29:57.588 --> 00:29:58.838
I remember now.

00:29:59.553 --> 00:30:02.065
In Jagath Seth's house.

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:07.340
It was his mother's death ceremony
that day. There were many people.

00:30:07.855 --> 00:30:11.272
Raja Krishnachandra,
Rai Rayan Jankiprasad,

00:30:11.362 --> 00:30:15.127
Nawab Iftikhar Salar Khan
Khanan Mohabbat Jung.

00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:21.042
Amir Chand of Sutanati, the one
mentioned in History as UmiChand.

00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:27.648
Sethji treated us to a lot of food.

00:30:28.413 --> 00:30:33.050
But the sweets ran out while

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:35.735
serving the Lords of Sutanati.

00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:39.868
So, they abused the host and left.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.195
Incredible!

00:30:44.572 --> 00:30:46.700
This is the perfect time to go
to him. He's in the right mood.

00:30:46.725 --> 00:30:48.418
Shall I go?
- Anyway.

00:30:49.633 --> 00:30:52.583
So, Motiram.
- Motiram?

00:30:53.058 --> 00:30:56.630
I knew you by that
name only, child.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.833
You were Sethji's accountant.

00:31:01.028 --> 00:31:05.360
So Motiram, you'd better chant

00:31:06.642 --> 00:31:09.948
the 'Dhurjati' mantra.

00:31:10.198 --> 00:31:13.773
Every morning, wake up
and chant it 108 times.

00:31:17.048 --> 00:31:19.725
Very fast, all right? Now go.

00:31:22.055 --> 00:31:27.028
Lord. What is better? The path
of urge or that of satisfaction?

00:31:27.243 --> 00:31:30.708
Fine question.

00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:35.702
Tulsi once asked me
the same question.

00:31:36.123 --> 00:31:41.382
Tulsidas! We eat food,

00:31:42.445 --> 00:31:44.538
don't we?
- Yes.

00:31:44.723 --> 00:31:46.970
But why do we eat?
- Why do we eat?

00:31:47.227 --> 00:31:49.295
Because we feel hungry.

00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:53.780
Because we feel hungry,
what do we eat?

00:31:54.863 --> 00:31:57.458
Rice, fruit, fish, meat, etc.

00:31:57.548 --> 00:32:00.253
Fish, meat.
- What happens

00:32:00.413 --> 00:32:02.245
when we eat?
- What happens?

00:32:02.335 --> 00:32:05.612
Our hunger is satisfied.
- It's satisfied.

00:32:05.793 --> 00:32:07.620
And so the root cause
- The root cause

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.367
of consumption is urge
- Urge.

00:32:11.457 --> 00:32:15.025
and the result of consumption
is satisfaction. - Satisfaction.

00:32:15.115 --> 00:32:17.572
Isn't that so?
- Yes.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.177
Yes.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.773
Tulsi was a sage.

00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:25.762
I told him

00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:28.950
without consumption
there is no satisfaction.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.645
I said, Tulsi,

00:32:31.735 --> 00:32:35.623
if there is no consumption
how can there be satisfaction?

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.982
So after Ramayan,
I changed him to King Mansingha.

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.690
Told him to consume
as much as he wanted to.

00:32:44.485 --> 00:32:47.210
He earned a lot of wealth

00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:49.458
but nothing remained with him.

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:53.438
He married the daughter of a Bengali
Jagatsingha and blew it all away.

00:32:53.757 --> 00:32:55.017
Excuse me.

00:32:55.107 --> 00:32:57.153
Bankim didn't write
that in his book.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.595
Excuse...
- My lord!

00:33:02.058 --> 00:33:05.663
Lord, find a solution for me.
- What do you want?

00:33:06.048 --> 00:33:08.925
Take me to 1914 for
seven days, Baba.

00:33:09.015 --> 00:33:11.713
I will buy some cheap iron, Baba.
Please, Baba.

00:33:12.135 --> 00:33:15.733
Iron?
- Yes. Iron, sir. I mean, Lord.

00:33:16.155 --> 00:33:19.635
Cheap?
- Yes, Lord. From 1914.

00:33:19.823 --> 00:33:23.110
What do you do? - I am the
ledger keeper in a bell tea shop.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.452
Salary is just 233 rupees per month.
I can't manage my family with that.

00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:31.063
Can't manage your family?
- No. The iron, my Lord!

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:36.515
Wealth does not come
so cheap, my man.

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:39.048
Does not!

00:33:39.138 --> 00:33:41.303
Very strict meditation is required.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.260
From the Muladhar Chakra,

00:33:45.285 --> 00:33:47.675
you must control KulaKundali,
the source of power.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.162
Then you'll have to raise it
to the Sahasrar Lotus.

00:33:50.252 --> 00:33:53.143
This Sahasrar is the sun.

00:33:53.903 --> 00:33:56.255
That sun has

00:33:57.017 --> 00:33:59.328
to move backwards.

00:33:59.418 --> 00:34:02.428
You must make it move backwards.

00:34:02.717 --> 00:34:05.422
If you do not understand
the science behind the sun,

00:34:05.512 --> 00:34:09.125
you can't do it.

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:13.570
And that is a matter
of huge expenditure.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.600
Then, sir. Sorry, Lord!

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.385
Then is there no solution?

00:34:20.778 --> 00:34:22.827
Please, Lord. Find some

00:34:23.298 --> 00:34:25.913
solution for me.

00:34:26.302 --> 00:34:30.573
There is a solution!
- There is?

00:34:30.663 --> 00:34:34.578
Right at noon,
when the clock strikes 12,

00:34:34.923 --> 00:34:36.697
go to the terrace.

00:34:36.868 --> 00:34:40.217
On the terrace, look at the sun

00:34:40.898 --> 00:34:46.373
and then chant 108 times martanda!

00:34:46.528 --> 00:34:48.450
Martanda!

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.315
But your eyes should not blink.

00:34:52.733 --> 00:34:55.868
Your tongue should not get dry.

00:34:56.038 --> 00:35:00.368
Only then. Tempora.

00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:03.620
Tempora.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.942
Boris.

00:35:07.155 --> 00:35:10.310
Nephic.

00:35:10.703 --> 00:35:13.803
Nitious.

00:35:14.357 --> 00:35:17.132
Nibhus.

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:20.660
Nibhorus.

00:35:40.328 --> 00:35:41.442
Buchki.

00:35:42.092 --> 00:35:44.755
This man... He's...

00:35:45.032 --> 00:35:48.035
What?
- Great!

00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:50.898
But just postpone your
induction for a few days. Please.

00:35:51.163 --> 00:35:53.288
Thanks for your suggestion.

00:35:54.438 --> 00:35:57.292
Don't worry. I'm there.

00:35:57.382 --> 00:36:00.190
I'll fix everything.
- Come on now.

00:36:14.162 --> 00:36:17.405
Doesn't work. This Baba is a fraud.

00:36:17.623 --> 00:36:21.035
What? Has your faith disappeared?
- It's all rubbish!

00:36:21.602 --> 00:36:24.812
No trace of poison.
Only empty threats.

00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:27.862
If you have so much power,
then show a miracle or two.

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:30.695
That he will not do.
All he does is talk

00:36:30.785 --> 00:36:32.522
about what he did in the Satta era.

00:36:32.705 --> 00:36:35.223
Who can do even that
these days, Nitai?

00:36:35.313 --> 00:36:37.957
Stare at the afternoon sun

00:36:38.047 --> 00:36:40.735
and chant a mantra.
You can't even bat your eyelashes.

00:36:40.895 --> 00:36:43.658
You try it and show me. Let me
see whether you blink or not.

00:36:43.957 --> 00:36:46.535
Is this some kind of a joke?

00:36:46.757 --> 00:36:48.383
That's where you went wrong.

00:36:48.473 --> 00:36:52.308
If he did it himself, he would
reduce the voltage of the sun.

00:36:52.683 --> 00:36:54.565
After all, I hear he moves
the moon and the sun.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.130
Nibaran, if you want to expose
that Baba, then I'm with you.

00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:01.557
Babaji's new get-up.

00:37:02.372 --> 00:37:04.490
Magician.
- How?

00:37:06.523 --> 00:37:08.910
I just saw Brahma.
- You saw Brahma?

00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:10.925
Sit.

00:37:15.465 --> 00:37:16.663
What do you mean you saw Brahma?

00:37:16.753 --> 00:37:19.415
I went over to their
place, Nibaran. - Why?

00:37:19.577 --> 00:37:22.383
I thought I'll meet Buchki
and fix up some thing.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.000
What?

00:37:24.495 --> 00:37:27.592
I knew I wouldn't be able
to meet her so I took her a letter.

00:37:27.923 --> 00:37:29.882
Another quotation?
- No!

00:37:29.972 --> 00:37:31.603
A poem.
- My, my!

00:37:32.163 --> 00:37:34.453
And what did you write?
- I wrote...

00:37:35.975 --> 00:37:39.248
Babaji's a fraud. But in my love...

00:37:40.102 --> 00:37:43.517
Can you go, Nitai?
- Just continue.

00:37:44.603 --> 00:37:47.012
I wrote, Babaji's a fraud.

00:37:47.102 --> 00:37:49.783
But my love for you
isn't fraudulent.

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:53.235
If you opt for induction,
why then should I stay alive?

00:37:55.395 --> 00:37:57.123
That's it. Two lines.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.255
Couplet.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.285
Fine. So did you give her
the letter?

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.260
Kind of. You see, Babaji
goes into a trance at seven,

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.778
and then everybody leaves.
So I thought

00:38:12.922 --> 00:38:16.215
if I go there at eight,
I might get to meet her.

00:38:16.385 --> 00:38:18.350
But still to be on the safe side,

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.388
I took the letter along with me.

00:38:20.575 --> 00:38:24.792
So, I reached there
at exactly eight.

00:38:30.993 --> 00:38:34.937
The house was silent except
for the striking of the clock.

00:38:35.213 --> 00:38:39.598
I was feeling a little nervous,
but still I entered inside.

00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:43.562
After climbing half the stairs,

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.438
I felt as if there was
no one upstairs.

00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:50.178
Darn it!
After mustering up such courage,

00:38:50.268 --> 00:38:52.523
would I have to return
home hopeless?

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.338
No. I must give it one last try.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.790
I thought I should check the
backyard and garden of the house.

00:39:00.983 --> 00:39:02.983
As I walked, I heard

00:39:03.142 --> 00:39:05.730
some strange sounds
emanating from there.

00:40:15.512 --> 00:40:17.858
Hey, Buchki.

00:40:58.888 --> 00:41:01.633
Brahmo, Brahma, Brahmayi.

00:41:01.723 --> 00:41:04.472
Brahmo, Brahma, Brahmayi.

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:07.568
Brahmo, Brahma, Brahmayi.

00:41:07.658 --> 00:41:11.658
Brahmo, Brahma, Brahmayi.

00:41:11.748 --> 00:41:13.665
Brahmo, Brahma, Brahmayi.

00:41:19.368 --> 00:41:21.078
Long live the Lord!

00:41:26.722 --> 00:41:29.095
And then?
- And then, the climax!

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.933
The climax?

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.003
While going to college,

00:41:33.495 --> 00:41:36.042
she dropped this in the mailbox.

00:41:39.312 --> 00:41:40.890
What has she written, brother?

00:41:45.345 --> 00:41:49.783
I know and understand
everything but I have no option.

00:41:50.038 --> 00:41:53.792
I will be free
if the Babaji leaves.

00:41:54.675 --> 00:41:57.148
So she understands, after all?

00:41:57.813 --> 00:42:01.118
Why wouldn't she?
Whose beloved is she, after all?

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.635
So why are you so excited, Satta?

00:42:06.725 --> 00:42:09.678
Remove this obstacle
and she is mine.

00:42:09.768 --> 00:42:11.685
Look at him.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.800
Is removing him so easy, Satta?

00:42:24.755 --> 00:42:26.995
It's not that easy.
- Oh no.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.873
Nibaran, you're giving up?

00:42:30.705 --> 00:42:33.713
Just think, Satta, the man
has some talent.

00:42:33.803 --> 00:42:37.312
He is the greatest obstacle
to my romance and you are saying...

00:42:39.288 --> 00:42:41.927
He is a high-class actor.

00:42:42.932 --> 00:42:44.932
He understands mass psychology.

00:42:45.802 --> 00:42:47.358
He's educated.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.555
Has an amazing memory.

00:42:51.495 --> 00:42:54.948
He has imagination.
Has presence of mind.

00:42:55.652 --> 00:42:57.002
Has guts.

00:42:57.383 --> 00:42:59.432
What more do you want?
- Oh Lord.

00:42:59.957 --> 00:43:02.065
But you can argue,
he does not have honesty.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.812
But today, many great
people lack that quality.

00:43:05.902 --> 00:43:07.602
There goes my hope.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.680
But...
- But?

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.482
He...
- He?

00:43:13.187 --> 00:43:16.065
has to be exposed.
- Hear!

00:43:16.353 --> 00:43:17.833
Because...
- Because?

00:43:18.653 --> 00:43:21.913
If he is not exposed, they will
also not be exposed. - Who?

00:43:22.738 --> 00:43:25.113
All those who are going
and falling at his feet,

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.800
encouraging him, letting him grow.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.428
You've just increased the
scope of our work, Nibaran.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:36.827
What is needed is one...
- Double exposure!

00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:41.273
Yes. One stone.
- Two birds. Get going, Nibaran.

00:43:42.752 --> 00:43:45.433
But...
- Now, what's this but?

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:50.662
How!

00:43:52.628 --> 00:43:55.690
Will I have to die chanting
how, Nibaran?

00:43:55.852 --> 00:43:58.908
Paramadha, you're into

00:43:59.975 --> 00:44:01.653
planning policies and things.

00:44:01.678 --> 00:44:03.445
Why don't you come up
with something good?

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.245
You shouldn't have let the salt
sprinkle on your open wounds.

00:44:06.628 --> 00:44:09.312
Instead, if you'd have picked
a policy then you would have...

00:44:09.402 --> 00:44:11.578
Anyway, forget it!
- Oh God.

00:44:21.013 --> 00:44:22.790
I've got it.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.022
Why are you laughing?
- My God!

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.790
Where there's smoke, there's...

00:44:58.812 --> 00:45:00.320
Satta!
- Yes.

00:45:05.013 --> 00:45:06.405
Are you

00:45:06.655 --> 00:45:09.047
on good terms with
the servants in that house?

00:45:09.137 --> 00:45:10.953
I tipped the guard that day

00:45:11.043 --> 00:45:13.960
for tying a Rakhi on my hand.
Solid two rupees.

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:15.857
Good.

00:45:16.493 --> 00:45:18.443
This tipping is...

00:45:19.688 --> 00:45:20.513
Parak?

00:45:21.612 --> 00:45:24.898
You people, I believe, have very
beneficial policies these days.

00:45:25.438 --> 00:45:26.808
Why?

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.800
Thinking of one...
- What is all this suspense for?

00:45:31.572 --> 00:45:33.725
Hello?
- Who? Nani?

00:45:34.548 --> 00:45:36.718
Did you eat grass? What?

00:45:38.958 --> 00:45:41.733
Listen. My room has

00:45:42.243 --> 00:45:44.933
been invaded by mice.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:49.310
What can I use to fill up
the room with plenty of smoke?

00:45:50.633 --> 00:45:54.018
Nitric acid and copper?

00:45:54.472 --> 00:45:59.007
Tri-nitro-di... No.

00:45:59.378 --> 00:46:01.948
I don't need red and blue
coloured smoke, brother.

00:46:02.038 --> 00:46:04.600
Just simple white smog to
fill the room...

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:05.808
What is sister-in-law saying?

00:46:06.493 --> 00:46:10.748
What? Wet straw? Splendid!

00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:14.583
Nani, that Nobel Prize will finally
be bagged by sister-in-law.

00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:16.680
And you...

00:46:19.513 --> 00:46:22.095
Bonny prince?

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.573
Bonny prince.

00:46:26.218 --> 00:46:29.297
Attaboy.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.108
Attaboy.

00:46:34.003 --> 00:46:37.435
Cosmos.

00:46:38.955 --> 00:46:41.293
Cosmos.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:44.525
- Whist-ling wind.

00:46:44.742 --> 00:46:46.292
What wind?

00:46:47.357 --> 00:46:49.895
Whist-ling.
- Whistling!

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:52.483
Whistling.

00:47:12.815 --> 00:47:14.960
It's getting a little dull, uncle.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.203
Let's take a break.

00:47:19.465 --> 00:47:20.795
Now relax.

00:47:22.183 --> 00:47:25.193
Paradise Hall has two
first-class movies playing.

00:47:27.018 --> 00:47:28.755
You're still not steady
on your legs.

00:47:29.468 --> 00:47:32.193
This bloody Nataraj's
art form is very difficult.

00:47:37.127 --> 00:47:41.625
"My heart dances along with me."

00:47:41.715 --> 00:47:45.938
"My heart dances along with me."

00:47:46.028 --> 00:47:48.815
"The whole world dances with me."

00:47:48.905 --> 00:47:53.108
"While you danced
the dance of destruction,"

00:47:53.198 --> 00:47:58.265
"Nataraj, the god of dances,"

00:47:58.355 --> 00:48:03.183
"Your tresses had fallen down..."

00:48:07.475 --> 00:48:10.450
Who is it?
- It's me. Guropodo.

00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:13.455
Wait.

00:48:54.232 --> 00:48:57.852
I think I've disturbed
your time of rest.

00:48:57.942 --> 00:49:01.435
What have I done
to deserve any rest?

00:49:01.995 --> 00:49:04.458
I came because

00:49:04.668 --> 00:49:08.510
I've been feeling a little anxious.
- Anxious about what?

00:49:09.267 --> 00:49:13.328
I mean you haven't complained

00:49:13.598 --> 00:49:18.602
but are you facing
any kind of difficulty?

00:49:19.063 --> 00:49:21.512
Is that all!
- Yes, I mean...

00:49:21.712 --> 00:49:25.475
Your food is okay I hope.

00:49:25.695 --> 00:49:29.842
Look, Guropodo, you're doing
everything you can.

00:49:30.373 --> 00:49:35.453
And I don't want you to do
anything that you can't.

00:49:35.698 --> 00:49:37.845
And talking of food,

00:49:37.935 --> 00:49:41.100
would I ask you for a
hippopotamus roast?

00:49:41.325 --> 00:49:44.353
I would not. Because I know

00:49:44.443 --> 00:49:46.655
that it is impossible for you
to get it.

00:49:47.143 --> 00:49:50.955
If that be the case...
- It's very tasty.

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:54.063
You know the time that you
term as the Stone Age?

00:49:54.153 --> 00:49:57.473
During that time, I ate quite a bit.
These days you will not get it.

00:49:57.778 --> 00:50:02.730
If you want something like...
Ganesh.

00:50:03.493 --> 00:50:06.128
Some other land animal
might have been simpler

00:50:06.218 --> 00:50:09.845
but we'll find a hippopotamus. New
Market stocks everything these days.

00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:14.510
Then just find out.
- Yes. It shouldn't be a problem.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.957
I hope you are not
facing any problem.

00:50:20.047 --> 00:50:23.313
Please do not embarrass me
by asking such questions.

00:50:23.338 --> 00:50:25.738
I am no one. Nothing.

00:50:25.928 --> 00:50:29.527
Very lean, very small,
very insignificant.

00:50:29.847 --> 00:50:32.518
My own happiness doesn't count.

00:50:32.608 --> 00:50:37.137
Gurudev's happiness is my
happiness. His peace is my peace.

00:50:37.552 --> 00:50:40.405
His satisfaction is mine.

00:50:40.693 --> 00:50:44.273
I found this person
at a fruit market in Babylon.

00:50:44.517 --> 00:50:46.233
Nebhu was then only a child.

00:50:46.323 --> 00:50:48.308
I was then just a child.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.260
Then was he also...

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.995
I was standing at the watermelon
shop buying watermelon

00:50:54.382 --> 00:50:56.513
when I felt someone

00:50:56.603 --> 00:51:01.015
tugging at the end of my robe.

00:51:01.798 --> 00:51:04.253
I saw humility in his eyes.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.055
And since then,
he has been with me.

00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:09.690
Amazing!
- Then again,

00:51:10.573 --> 00:51:12.793
he is of the Asirio race.

00:51:13.015 --> 00:51:16.313
In his earlier birth, he was a
scorpion.

00:51:16.338 --> 00:51:17.903
That's why he's a little...

00:51:22.057 --> 00:51:25.907
Okay then, I will take your leave.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.680
If there's anything you need...
- I'll tell you!

00:51:30.828 --> 00:51:33.362
We'll definitely tell you.
- Okay.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.715
Grandfather.
- What?

00:51:45.077 --> 00:51:47.308
The food of the house
has become stale.

00:51:47.748 --> 00:51:50.095
One day give us some
first-class mutton biriyani.

00:51:50.185 --> 00:51:51.903
Rubbish! Mutton biriyani!

00:51:51.993 --> 00:51:54.902
People are getting anxious to watch
some Gods. Now it's Mahadev, right?

00:51:54.992 --> 00:51:56.893
Yes. This time it's Mahadev.
- I've already announced it.

00:51:56.983 --> 00:51:59.283
Yes, this time it's Mahadev.
Next moonless night,

00:51:59.373 --> 00:52:02.293
it's Vishnu. Then Jesus,
then Buddha, then Hanuman.

00:52:02.383 --> 00:52:05.008
Why don't you make a long list
and hang it on the main door?

00:52:05.098 --> 00:52:08.130
I will. But the crowds
are getting unmanageable.

00:52:08.693 --> 00:52:12.048
The room is small.
Call the people by rotation.

00:52:12.325 --> 00:52:15.525
One thing, grandfather,
no young lads.

00:52:16.687 --> 00:52:19.453
Remember that day you told some boy
that you saw him at Murshidabad?

00:52:19.543 --> 00:52:20.803
Who? Satta?
- Yes.

00:52:20.933 --> 00:52:23.312
He is an idiot! Harmless!

00:52:23.402 --> 00:52:24.960
Why increase the tension,
grandfather?

00:52:25.228 --> 00:52:27.078
No young people except the females.

00:52:27.168 --> 00:52:29.743
Middle-aged people, people
your age, but not the sly ones.

00:52:30.008 --> 00:52:31.882
Either people with faith or an eye
weakness.

00:52:31.907 --> 00:52:32.938
Besides that, no admission.

00:52:33.003 --> 00:52:35.492
You keep quiet.
Age is not the main factor.

00:52:35.582 --> 00:52:37.135
Yes, the main factor is...

00:52:37.297 --> 00:52:39.050
Exactly.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.553
If only I could go out, I would
have tried playing treble top.

00:52:41.727 --> 00:52:44.273
What about letting
the Vajpai enter?

00:52:44.838 --> 00:52:47.208
The one who said he'd make us
a three-storied hermitage?

00:52:47.298 --> 00:52:50.392
Yes. With cooling system and lift!

00:52:50.482 --> 00:52:53.865
Yes. Why not? You will also
have two rooms in that.

00:52:53.955 --> 00:52:56.030
Yes. Don't forget my ten percent.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.548
Does anyone forget their cousin?

00:52:58.638 --> 00:53:00.397
Have you ever heard of that?

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.607
Hippopotamus roast!

00:53:07.272 --> 00:53:09.780
You are a bombastic person.

00:53:31.825 --> 00:53:34.567
At seven sharp. Understood, Parak?

00:53:35.008 --> 00:53:38.345
But be careful. Even if you're
half a minute early or late,

00:53:38.435 --> 00:53:40.630
everything will be spoiled.

00:53:40.993 --> 00:53:43.372
The first stroke of seven

00:53:43.717 --> 00:53:46.700
must match your matchstick stroke.
Understood?

00:53:47.605 --> 00:53:49.750
And what is Nitai's function?

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.318
Or will he only listen
to the artefacts being stated?

00:53:53.045 --> 00:53:55.752
The first reaction to the
smoke will be from him.

00:53:56.505 --> 00:54:00.025
You better watch the window
carefully. - At the window?

00:54:00.518 --> 00:54:02.800
Will you be able to act scared?

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:04.763
Why act, my brother?

00:54:04.853 --> 00:54:06.753
You've seen my wife, right?

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.338
All I need to do is think
of her moon-like face.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:12.548
What about me?
- You?

00:54:12.953 --> 00:54:17.373
You think and figure
it out yourself. One house,

00:54:18.343 --> 00:54:20.808
lots of people,
and a fire breaks out.

00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:23.635
Panic!
- And in the ensuing confusion,

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.970
the girl you want to marry is
trapped. What will you do?

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:29.668
Rescue!
- Good!

00:54:29.758 --> 00:54:32.020
Should I propose at that moment?

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.200
You can.
- But if she refuses?

00:54:35.365 --> 00:54:37.033
Idiot! No means yes.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.718
Good night.

00:54:47.335 --> 00:54:49.493
Good night. Good evening.

00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:52.198
Are you fine?
- With your blessings, madam.

00:54:52.358 --> 00:54:54.503
What is the manifestation today?

00:54:54.593 --> 00:54:56.080
Vishnu?
- No, sir.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.108
Shiva Nataraj.
- Really?

00:54:58.198 --> 00:55:00.702
I told you it was Mahadev.
- Yes.

00:55:00.792 --> 00:55:03.062
He who rotates earth.

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:08.892
Come, Bardhomanji. Fine.
- How are you, Ganesh Babu?

00:55:09.767 --> 00:55:12.578
What's this?
- Date palm jaggery?

00:55:12.668 --> 00:55:14.500
Yes, date palm jaggery.

00:55:14.862 --> 00:55:16.202
Will I be able to see Shiva?

00:55:16.292 --> 00:55:18.235
Yes. Of course!

00:55:18.325 --> 00:55:20.715
If you won't get to see it,
who will?

00:55:20.805 --> 00:55:24.115
You've given Babaji so much,
haven't you?

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.947
Of course, you will get to see.
Ten percent of it.

00:55:27.365 --> 00:55:30.368
If you want, you will also get.

00:55:30.458 --> 00:55:31.990
Really?

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.727
Is that so?
- Yes, it is.

00:55:33.817 --> 00:55:35.595
It is?
- Sure, it is.

00:55:35.972 --> 00:55:37.780
Come in.

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:40.825
Go quickly and sit in the front or
else there'll soon be a huge queue.

00:55:40.915 --> 00:55:43.860
Go.
- Greetings.

00:55:44.048 --> 00:55:45.962
How are you?
- So you people have come.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.852
Satta, people from your
house have all come? - Yes.

00:55:52.045 --> 00:55:55.430
We'll go in now.

00:55:55.995 --> 00:55:57.538
Sattabhushan,

00:55:57.628 --> 00:55:59.457
that interview letter did not come.

00:55:59.547 --> 00:56:01.555
It will come. Any day now.

00:56:01.645 --> 00:56:03.685
Any day now? That type in...

00:56:03.775 --> 00:56:05.388
Do not worry. I am there.

00:56:05.478 --> 00:56:07.440
Right. You're there.
-Right.

00:56:07.662 --> 00:56:11.010
And listen,
you go upstairs and sit.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.480
Don't sit too much in front.
Sit a little at the back.

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.847
Babaji does not believe
in the present, you know.

00:56:15.937 --> 00:56:18.317
The present generation is also...

00:56:18.407 --> 00:56:20.857
Not there. Non-existent.

00:56:21.273 --> 00:56:23.598
Only past and future.

00:56:23.688 --> 00:56:25.422
Right?

00:56:35.627 --> 00:56:38.472
Everybody wants money and wealth.

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.290
Everybody wants money and wealth.

00:56:43.888 --> 00:56:46.810
Isn't that so? But it has

00:56:47.858 --> 00:56:50.790
to fall in the right hands.

00:56:51.897 --> 00:56:56.533
The hand has to be the right one.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.613
If it falls in the wrong hands,
it can cause calamity.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:08.155
And that is what leads
to confusion.

00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:13.290
Actually, wealth is not important.

00:57:13.757 --> 00:57:16.273
What is important

00:57:16.545 --> 00:57:18.835
is the hand on which it lands.

00:57:19.003 --> 00:57:21.875
This is the reason for all fights.

00:57:22.303 --> 00:57:24.932
This is the reason
for all arguments.

00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:27.257
With whom, do you know?

00:57:37.817 --> 00:57:39.912
Jesus.

00:57:41.177 --> 00:57:43.262
Jesus.
- Baba.

00:57:45.525 --> 00:57:46.753
Baba.

00:57:49.367 --> 00:57:51.780
Baba!

00:57:59.353 --> 00:58:00.728
Baba.

00:58:12.527 --> 00:58:14.385
Jesus said,

00:58:15.422 --> 00:58:19.005
wealthy people can
never reach heaven.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.610
I said, why not?

00:58:24.665 --> 00:58:27.510
If you misuse money
then it happens.

00:58:28.142 --> 00:58:31.825
If you misuse money
then it happens.

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.615
That day...

00:58:39.237 --> 00:58:40.848
That day,

00:58:41.533 --> 00:58:43.305
I told him a few nasty words.

00:58:44.293 --> 00:58:45.608
Later,

00:58:47.655 --> 00:58:49.655
there was regret.

00:58:50.687 --> 00:58:52.313
Regret.

00:58:53.325 --> 00:58:54.963
Poor lad.

00:58:55.617 --> 00:58:58.320
Poor lad lost his life.

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.135
Poor lad.

00:59:03.385 --> 00:59:06.070
Lost his life.
- Poor lad.

00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:10.428
Lost his life.
- Poor lad.

00:59:14.875 --> 00:59:16.640
Excuse me, Lord.

00:59:19.532 --> 00:59:22.105
Who is it?
- Excuse me.

00:59:22.928 --> 00:59:26.075
Come closer. Allow him to come.

00:59:26.657 --> 00:59:30.165
He has something to ask.

00:59:31.053 --> 00:59:33.172
Come!

00:59:33.602 --> 00:59:36.845
Lord I...
- Seeing you,

00:59:36.935 --> 00:59:38.470
I am reminded of Manu.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.358
Who? Manu Chatterjee?

00:59:45.108 --> 00:59:48.438
Manu Shayumbhu. Sharachi. Goutami.

00:59:48.528 --> 00:59:51.282
Damash. Bairath. Chakhush. Sabarno.

00:59:51.372 --> 00:59:53.135
Dakhya Saborno. Brahma Saborno.

00:59:53.225 --> 00:59:55.190
Dharma Saborno. Rudra Saborno.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.193
Rouchya. Bhoutya. Shayambhu.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.783
He comes and tells me,

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:05.147
I have written the Samhita.
Please look at it.

01:00:05.237 --> 01:00:07.603
If you don't have a look at it,
I won't be at peace.

01:00:10.295 --> 01:00:13.228
So I said, let me see
what you've written.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.760
One lakh slokas.

01:00:17.035 --> 01:00:19.315
Oh, my God! What have you done?

01:00:19.505 --> 01:00:22.012
Who will read so much?
Who has the time for it?

01:00:22.345 --> 01:00:24.277
Cut it!

01:00:24.685 --> 01:00:28.610
300. I selected 300 slokas for him.

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.593
I said, keep these,
they will come in handy.

01:00:32.085 --> 01:00:33.460
The rest, he threw away.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.125
Excuse me...
- I'll tell you about one more Manu.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:41.763
It was the Age of White Pigs.

01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:44.712
Before the time
of the Great Destruction.

01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:47.583
One day, the Creator...

01:00:48.213 --> 01:00:50.392
The Creator came and told me,

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:56.113
I've created humans but where will
they stand? What will they eat?

01:00:56.283 --> 01:00:58.775
Everywhere, there was only water.

01:00:59.262 --> 01:01:03.883
Seeing the state of the earth,
the Creator got scared.

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.642
Seeing his fear,
I felt pity for him.

01:01:07.862 --> 01:01:11.678
I said, don't feel scared.
I am here.

01:01:11.915 --> 01:01:14.770
The science of the sun
is in the clasp of my hand.

01:01:15.045 --> 01:01:17.203
I increased the power of the sun.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.843
All the water dried up.

01:01:21.005 --> 01:01:23.870
The earth filled up
with forest and trees.

01:01:24.108 --> 01:01:28.515
Lord, did you know Jesus Christ?

01:01:30.203 --> 01:01:34.223
People say crucifixion.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.580
I say crucifact.

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:40.345
Because I have seen it
all with my own eyes.

01:01:40.815 --> 01:01:44.835
My God! And Gautama Buddha?

01:01:46.025 --> 01:01:47.348
Gautam?

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:53.665
That Gautam? Gautam was just
a young lad of yesterday.

01:01:54.668 --> 01:01:58.050
I knew the Buddha
when he was a young lad.

01:01:59.657 --> 01:02:02.915
Tempora.

01:02:03.202 --> 01:02:05.892
Boris.

01:02:06.588 --> 01:02:09.210
Nephic.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.727
Nitious.

01:02:12.022 --> 01:02:14.452
Nibhus.

01:02:14.622 --> 01:02:17.118
Nibhorus.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:30.842
Don't go.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.330
Fire!

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.940
Fire!

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:40.065
Fire!

01:02:40.155 --> 01:02:41.808
What's this?

01:02:41.898 --> 01:02:43.608
Fire!

01:02:43.698 --> 01:02:45.468
Fire!

01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:48.695
Fire!

01:02:49.498 --> 01:02:52.273
Fire!

01:02:52.363 --> 01:02:55.303
Fire!

01:03:01.302 --> 01:03:02.940
Fire!

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:08.512
Fire!

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:18.573
Hey! Fire!

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.538
Hello. Fire brigade?

01:03:29.628 --> 01:03:31.778
Fire brigade?

01:03:44.778 --> 01:03:47.528
Leave me. What are you doing?

01:03:47.618 --> 01:03:49.897
Leave me. There's a fire.

01:03:49.987 --> 01:03:51.993
Leave me.
- Why?

01:03:52.277 --> 01:03:55.163
Don't you know the science
behind the fire? Lord?

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:07.908
Now leave, Babaji.
No more in this locality.

01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:21.032
What are you doing?
- Rescue.

01:04:23.975 --> 01:04:25.920
Where is the fire?
- Hold still.

01:04:28.653 --> 01:04:31.948
Can I ask you something?
This is not a quotation.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.243
My original words.

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:35.973
Shall I?
- What?

01:04:36.063 --> 01:04:38.868
Will you marry me?

01:04:39.345 --> 01:04:40.520
Oh my God!

01:04:41.718 --> 01:04:43.517
Really?

01:05:27.627 --> 01:05:30.425
Baba!

01:05:35.485 --> 01:05:36.530
Let's go.

01:05:40.398 --> 01:05:43.313
Well, you're not so
silly after all!

01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:46.133
Towards the future. Let's go.

01:05:48.525 --> 01:05:49.648
Let's go.
