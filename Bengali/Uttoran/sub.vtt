THE BROKEN JOURNEY.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.692
How many times will
you read your own speech?

00:03:15.372 --> 00:03:17.132
Your tea is getting cold.

00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:19.532
Just going over it once-

00:03:20.052 --> 00:03:21.332
in case I've missed out something.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:22.612
What's your topic?

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:27.772
The progress in medicine
in the past two decades.

00:03:29.372 --> 00:03:32.172
Now-a-days, mainly
three diseases are fatal-

00:03:32.932 --> 00:03:35.972
cancer, heart attack or stroke.

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:39.252
On all three fronts
research is going on.

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:43.972
At some point people have to die, Mili.

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:49.012
If population goes on
increasing at this rate

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:53.932
We may feel sympathy-

00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:56.612
for the victims of flood and drought-

00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:59.132
but in a country like ours-

00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:01.772
these are nature's own ways to keep-

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:06.212
the population in check.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.772
Had family planning programme-

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:12.172
been effective in rural India-

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.212
it would have been a different story.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.092
Strange contradiction !

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:24.372
On one hand the fight is
on to reduce the population.

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:28.212
On the other hand,
to eradicate diseases.

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:30.892
To increase human longevity.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.532
- I have a request. - What?

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:41.892
Chumki is going to college now.

00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:43.812
She'll come down in a moment-

00:04:44.532 --> 00:04:46.252
will you have a word with her ?

00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:51.292
Do you really believe that-

00:04:51.372 --> 00:04:52.652
she's involved with
those undesirable elements

00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:55.612
You don't have time to observe her.

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:59.772
You're out on calls from ten to ten.

00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:05.492
She has changed a
lot in these two years.

00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:12.012
She was never so rude
and an introvert before.

00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:14.812
And her college has a bad reputation

00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:17.252
I was totally unaware of the fact.

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:22.092
It was Khitish who told me
all about it in the club.

00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:30.492
I request you to have a talk with her.

00:05:35.212 --> 00:05:39.652
If she's really involved in all this,

00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:41.892
such pep talk won't help.

00:05:43.692 --> 00:05:46.772
You have no idea how
reckless and obstinate they can be.

00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:57.052
Will you be back late again ?

00:05:57.692 --> 00:05:58.652
Don't know.

00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:02.132
Chumki?

00:06:02.932 --> 00:06:03.852
What?

00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:05.052
Sit down.

00:06:06.052 --> 00:06:06.932
What do you mean?

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:08.812
You don't understand?

00:06:09.252 --> 00:06:10.412
Come and sit down.

00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:15.572
- I'll get late. - No,
you won't. Sit down.

00:06:16.172 --> 00:06:17.372
I've to talk to you.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:51.212
Certain unpleasant things
have come to my knowledge.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.852
Have some students in
your college taken to drugs?

00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:03.172
- Other colleges too.

00:07:03.572 --> 00:07:06.052
I am not concerned with other colleges.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:10.252
I want to know just one thing.

00:07:12.412 --> 00:07:13.932
Do you take drugs?

00:07:19.092 --> 00:07:20.132
Do you?

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:22.532
Listen -

00:07:24.052 --> 00:07:27.652
Drugs are hundred times
more harmful than this.

00:07:28.972 --> 00:07:30.412
Even your doctor
father won't be able to-

00:07:31.172 --> 00:07:33.332
take you out from the clutches of drugs.

00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:35.692
Just keep it in mind.

00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:37.172
I'm going.

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:43.012
Chumki.

00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:49.772
Just come here.

00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:56.492
Hey, Chumki. What is wrong with you?

00:07:56.572 --> 00:07:58.332
We are already late.

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.052
Hi. You are late.

00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:01.052
Finished dressing up
at last. That is slow.

00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:02.732
Look who is talking.

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.292
What do you think of her behaviour?

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:13.452
I didn't get any proof-

00:08:14.812 --> 00:08:16.572
that she's taken to drugs.

00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:19.252
College girls now-a-days-

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.972
are very independent spirited.

00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:25.332
You can't prove anything
by cross questioning them.

00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:26.972
I get my proof-

00:08:28.212 --> 00:08:32.412
when I see my daughter
changing in front of my eyes.

00:08:33.372 --> 00:08:35.332
You are busy with your
high society patients.

00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:39.132
I have to suffer the
humiliation all the time.

00:08:44.372 --> 00:08:45.012
Hello. Yes, yes.

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:49.572
Please hold on, I'll call him.

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:54.972
Jamshedpur.

00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:57.492
Jamshedpur? Is the seminar cancelled?

00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:58.412
Hello.

00:08:58.492 --> 00:09:00.212
- It's me, Nikhil. - Who?

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:01.572
Nikhil. Nikhil.

00:09:02.412 --> 00:09:07.212
Hearing your voice after ten
years ! But you used to be in Bombay.

00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:08.772
Since ' 87 we're here.

00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:09.572
I see.

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:11.612
You have a talk here tomorrow.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:13.892
Yes. A Rotary Club talk.

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:14.812
Silly joke. You are aware.

00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:16.052
Travelling by train or car ?

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:18.812
By car. Early tomorrow morning.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.852
- And returning? - Day
after tomorrow morning.

00:09:20.932 --> 00:09:21.692
Impossible!

00:09:22.492 --> 00:09:23.172
What do you mean?

00:09:23.452 --> 00:09:26.052
You'll have to come today. not tomorrow.

00:09:26.772 --> 00:09:28.812
Since you are coming by car,
there's no problem.

00:09:29.212 --> 00:09:32.852
If you start after lunch,
you'll reach by late evening.

00:09:33.212 --> 00:09:34.652
You'll spend the night here.

00:09:35.132 --> 00:09:36.852
Tomorrow's Sunday.
We'll gossip the whole day.

00:09:37.372 --> 00:09:38.172
But-

00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:39.652
No more 'but's.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:42.892
Before leaving Bombay I had told you-

00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:45.132
that I was going to Jameshedpur,

00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:46.812
and you forgot all about it ?

00:09:47.172 --> 00:09:48.972
Our friendship is thirty years old.

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:51.812
I was a witness to your
marriage and you to mine.

00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:53.852
I remember everything.

00:09:54.252 --> 00:09:55.892
What you don't know is-

00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:58.772
by the grace of God I
have a roaring practice now.

00:09:58.892 --> 00:10:01.372
If you give the excuse of your patients,

00:10:01.772 --> 00:10:03.812
I'll start abusing you.

00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:07.332
You finish with the urgent cases now.

00:10:07.412 --> 00:10:08.652
That's O.K. So it's fixed.

00:10:09.132 --> 00:10:12.292
Take down my address and phone number.
- Wait.

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:19.812
Yes, tell me.

00:10:19.892 --> 00:10:21.412
15, Parth Road. - 15, Parth Road.

00:10:21.492 --> 00:10:23.892
25052.

00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:28.172
25052.

00:10:28.732 --> 00:10:29.252
Right.

00:10:29.332 --> 00:10:31.252
So, we'll be expecting you this evening.

00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:35.132
Bring your " emergency kit " along.
- Why ?

00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:38.652
A colleague of mine is
suffering from dreadful asthma.

00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:41.412
You may give him a check up. -O.K.

00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:43.772
Bye.
- See you.

00:10:46.532 --> 00:10:48.532
What's the matter?
- Scandalous !

00:10:49.972 --> 00:10:52.812
I had totally forgotten that
Nikhil stays in Jamshedpur.

00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:55.732
That means you'll have to leave today?

00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.212
What else can I do ?

00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:02.252
I'll finish off a few : "calls".

00:11:03.692 --> 00:11:06.492
Cancel all appointments at the clinic.

00:11:08.012 --> 00:11:09.452
Have my lunch and start off.

00:11:10.972 --> 00:11:14.332
It's a seven hours' drive. Goodbye.

00:12:11.212 --> 00:12:11.932
Good morning.

00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:13.092
Good morning.

00:12:18.012 --> 00:12:20.932
I wonder why I feel fit
just by looking at you.

00:12:21.412 --> 00:12:23.772
So I needn't examine you.

00:12:24.132 --> 00:12:25.772
Just show my face.

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:30.172
No, your Smiling face.

00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:31.452
Understand?

00:12:31.892 --> 00:12:36.572
No madam, you're taking
your illness too lightly.

00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:41.412
As a doctor, I can't allow that.
I must examine you.

00:12:47.612 --> 00:12:49.052
Some coffee?

00:12:51.132 --> 00:12:52.212
No ...

00:12:54.012 --> 00:12:56.372
... I'm in a bit of a hurry.

00:12:58.012 --> 00:13:00.892
Now-a-days, you're always in a hurry.

00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:02.692
You're right.

00:13:04.252 --> 00:13:05.812
My practice is growing!

00:13:09.692 --> 00:13:11.092
Forget all your other patients.

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:26.892
Why can't I be your only patient?

00:13:28.732 --> 00:13:31.652
So you'll bear all our expenses?

00:13:32.972 --> 00:13:35.132
Why, am I not capable of it?

00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:38.852
Of course, you are
wife of a millionaire;

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:41.692
Only daughter of a multi millionaire.

00:13:44.332 --> 00:13:47.532
Now tell me how I am.

00:13:48.972 --> 00:13:51.612
As long as you're involved
with your womens' council,

00:13:51.692 --> 00:13:54.852
you won't be fully fit.

00:13:56.132 --> 00:13:58.732
I know what goes on in those meetings.

00:14:00.292 --> 00:14:03.212
As long as your plans to
beautify Calcutta are on-

00:14:03.572 --> 00:14:05.332
you'll be careless.

00:14:06.052 --> 00:14:09.732
You'll smoke, get
excited in arguements ...

00:14:10.932 --> 00:14:11.932
You know,

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:14.652
we can launch our
project with three lakh rupees.

00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:17.492
And Mrs. Lakhotia has
promised us the money.

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:20.972
Still, you'll have to give
up all that for a few days.

00:14:21.372 --> 00:14:23.052
Stay at home and take
your medicines regularly.

00:14:24.372 --> 00:14:25.492
And read some story books.

00:14:27.772 --> 00:14:29.372
Not these fashion magazines.

00:14:30.052 --> 00:14:34.332
Read good literature
- Tagore, Sarat Chandra.

00:14:34.412 --> 00:14:36.332
Or Ramkrishna Kathamrita.

00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:40.252
I've read Tagore.

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:44.812
When?
- In my college days.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.932
- What have you read?
"- Shesher Kabita."

00:14:49.812 --> 00:14:54.252
He hadn't a clue about modern,
sophisticated girls.

00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:56.892
Then you live with your high pressure.

00:14:57.172 --> 00:15:01.292
You're going?
- I'm in a hurry.

00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:05.492
Today I didn't see
you smiling even once.

00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:09.692
Let's keep it for my next visit.

00:15:10.132 --> 00:15:10.772
I am leaving.

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:47.332
Good morning.

00:15:48.972 --> 00:15:49.732
Morning.

00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:52.972
So, how are you?

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:56.372
The doctor says I'm fine.

00:15:56.652 --> 00:16:00.372
That's good. My opinion in
heart cases is valueless.

00:16:00.652 --> 00:16:03.052
Valueless? Don't be silly.

00:16:04.332 --> 00:16:09.252
One doesn't often come
across G.Ps of your caliber.

00:16:12.212 --> 00:16:13.252
Oh, by the way -

00:16:14.852 --> 00:16:17.532
I'm not coming tomorrow.
I'll see you the day after.

00:16:17.972 --> 00:16:18.732
Why?

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.652
What is the matter?

00:16:19.972 --> 00:16:20.772
Jamshedpur.

00:16:20.852 --> 00:16:25.212
Going there to lecture to
the Rotary Club members.

00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:26.172
Really ?

00:16:27.172 --> 00:16:31.212
Advances in medical research
over the last twenty years.

00:16:33.612 --> 00:16:35.412
I hope you'll mention

00:16:35.492 --> 00:16:38.572
who are actually reaping the
benefits of this progress.

00:16:39.212 --> 00:16:40.092
Who else?

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.532
Mankind.

00:16:44.852 --> 00:16:49.292
Do you know the price of the
injection that saved my life?

00:16:55.092 --> 00:16:56.532
Three and a half thousand.

00:16:58.412 --> 00:17:00.652
Three thousand and five hundred rupees..

00:17:00.732 --> 00:17:02.532
.. just one injection.

00:17:04.292 --> 00:17:05.932
Forget about the poor.

00:17:06.852 --> 00:17:09.132
Middle class patients
too can't afford it.

00:17:10.852 --> 00:17:14.292
I could afford it, because my
company bore all the expenses.

00:17:15.132 --> 00:17:18.572
Poor villagers don't
usually suffer from strokes-

00:17:18.652 --> 00:17:19.892
and heart attacks.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.372
That maybe so.

00:17:21.652 --> 00:17:25.412
But they die of common
diseases for sheer lack of treatment.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.772
You're involved only
with the urban high society.

00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:36.252
Your patients say "
Ouch " when they get hurt.

00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:39.052
Although today I have a big job,

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:43.492
I haven't lost all my idealism.

00:17:44.812 --> 00:17:48.932
I was once a follower of Vivekananda.

00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:53.692
The kind of qualification you have -

00:17:54.012 --> 00:17:56.652
you could have done a lot for the poor -

00:17:56.972 --> 00:17:59.412
with a little sacrifice.

00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:03.892
Then today you would have been
decorated with a :Padmabhushan."

00:18:04.692 --> 00:18:06.892
I don't want those titles.

00:18:07.692 --> 00:18:08.772
I'm fine.

00:18:09.452 --> 00:18:12.892
At my age a person can't
suddenly become philanthropic.

00:18:13.372 --> 00:18:15.532
You have to be born with it.

00:18:18.372 --> 00:18:20.732
The govt will look after the poor.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.852
Some good things have been
done for them, I'm told.

00:18:25.212 --> 00:18:25.932
Anyway.

00:18:26.732 --> 00:18:29.132
I am leaving today.

00:18:29.612 --> 00:18:30.532
We will meet day after. Take care.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:16.852
What happened?

00:20:17.652 --> 00:20:18.892
Is it a puncture?

00:20:24.972 --> 00:20:27.172
Sir, it'll take five minutes.
I'll change the tyre.

00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:14.012
Hey!

00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:36.652
What's wrong with you?

00:22:42.212 --> 00:22:43.092
Ready, sir.

00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:51.852
What is your name?

00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:57.972
What is your name?

00:24:04.172 --> 00:24:08.092
Sir, I'm dying. Save me.

00:24:09.532 --> 00:24:10.692
But what happened to you?

00:24:13.412 --> 00:24:16.292
I'm under the spell.

00:24:17.772 --> 00:24:19.252
Like last time.

00:24:20.532 --> 00:24:21.532
In the same way.

00:24:22.292 --> 00:24:23.452
Oh my God.

00:24:31.212 --> 00:24:32.092
Under the spell?

00:24:35.532 --> 00:24:37.292
It's torturing me.

00:24:41.892 --> 00:24:44.692
In which village do you stay?

00:24:48.252 --> 00:24:53.452
- Ko-"Kodali". - Is it close by?

00:24:59.092 --> 00:25:00.052
Listen.

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:04.252
You take the car and go
towards those villages.

00:25:04.892 --> 00:25:06.372
One of them must be "Kodali"

00:25:06.892 --> 00:25:08.492
Tell the villagers that somebody-

00:25:08.572 --> 00:25:10.412
from their village is seriously ill -

00:25:10.492 --> 00:25:11.812
and lying by the way side.

00:25:11.892 --> 00:25:12.412
He is in bad condition. - I see.

00:25:12.492 --> 00:25:14.772
They should come
immediately and take him home.

00:25:14.892 --> 00:25:17.772
Bring at least four of them by your car.

00:25:17.932 --> 00:25:19.052
Now go.

00:25:27.532 --> 00:25:28.372
Listen.

00:25:29.812 --> 00:25:31.332
Can you hear me?

00:25:36.492 --> 00:25:37.852
How did you come here?

00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:39.852
Where had you gone?

00:25:41.772 --> 00:25:43.092
To the market place?

00:25:44.172 --> 00:25:45.092
The market place.

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:49.972
Had you come down here to urinate?

00:25:53.252 --> 00:25:55.092
Yes.

00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:57.012
Was it today?

00:26:00.252 --> 00:26:01.732
Thursday.

00:26:02.692 --> 00:26:04.012
Thursday !

00:26:05.452 --> 00:26:06.692
And today's Saturday.

00:26:08.132 --> 00:26:10.532
You've been lying here
for the past two days !

00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:12.292
Tell me.

00:26:20.172 --> 00:26:22.532
Save me !

00:26:49.092 --> 00:26:50.252
Please come with me.

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:04.892
It's Hala ! Has he been drinking again ?

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.732
Do you all know him?

00:27:06.812 --> 00:27:08.812
His name is Holadhar,
sir. He's from my village.

00:27:10.852 --> 00:27:11.812
Hola,

00:27:12.612 --> 00:27:13.332
Hey, Hola.

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:15.652
what's wrong with you?

00:27:15.692 --> 00:27:20.692
Listen, I'm a doctor, and
let me tell you, he's very ill.

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:21.932
He was lying here for two days.

00:27:22.012 --> 00:27:23.972
Didn't you notice that he was missing?

00:27:24.292 --> 00:27:27.772
He often absconds for two, three days.

00:27:27.852 --> 00:27:31.012
How would we know that
this time he was taken ill ?

00:27:31.212 --> 00:27:33.212
He's quite a vagabond.

00:27:33.532 --> 00:27:37.372
Doesn't he do any farming?
- Yes, he has some land.

00:27:38.332 --> 00:27:40.012
The harvesting is just over.

00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:44.052
And he's already started blowing
up his earnings in drugs and booze.

00:27:45.692 --> 00:27:48.852
Is there a doctor nearby?

00:27:48.932 --> 00:27:49.852
Yes.

00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:52.252
Mr. Sanyal of our village is a Kaviraj.

00:27:52.492 --> 00:27:55.772
And in the next
village there's Dr. Nakul.

00:27:56.972 --> 00:27:58.652
May I say something?

00:28:00.532 --> 00:28:01.292
Yes.

00:28:01.532 --> 00:28:03.052
My name is Jatin Kundu.

00:28:03.652 --> 00:28:06.452
I'm a primary school
teacher in a village here.

00:28:06.532 --> 00:28:08.492
What would you like to say?

00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:12.012
You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes.

00:28:12.532 --> 00:28:14.972
Could you possibly stay back?

00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:16.572
No.

00:28:16.812 --> 00:28:18.892
I have an important work in Jamshedpur.

00:28:18.972 --> 00:28:21.972
It'll take three
more hours to get there.

00:28:23.572 --> 00:28:26.932
I suggest, the village chiefs be called.

00:28:28.052 --> 00:28:29.652
It's their job to organize-

00:28:29.732 --> 00:28:33.212
taking critical patients
to the town for treatment.

00:28:33.492 --> 00:28:37.532
That's a good idea.
- You carry on doctor.

00:28:37.692 --> 00:28:39.612
We'll do the needful.

00:28:40.132 --> 00:28:42.892
I'm a little keen to
know what you'll do.

00:28:43.172 --> 00:28:45.692
Then let me tell you frankly.

00:28:45.892 --> 00:28:49.972
Five years ago, when
Haladhar had the same disease,

00:28:50.692 --> 00:28:52.332
medicines didn't work.

00:28:52.412 --> 00:28:55.212
And how would they ? He was possessed.

00:28:56.212 --> 00:28:58.292
What are you saying?
- Believe me.

00:28:58.652 --> 00:29:00.972
He was cured by an exorcist.

00:29:01.052 --> 00:29:02.852
We'll call him again this time.

00:29:02.932 --> 00:29:05.932
Village chiefs don't bother about us.

00:29:06.172 --> 00:29:07.692
You go your own way,

00:29:07.772 --> 00:29:09.612
we'll take care of him.

00:29:10.772 --> 00:29:12.132
Anyway -

00:29:12.972 --> 00:29:18.532
You decide what's best for him.

00:29:19.852 --> 00:29:21.532
But do something fast.

00:29:22.692 --> 00:29:24.052
His condition is critical.

00:29:24.572 --> 00:29:26.732
If he continues to be
exposed to the cold,

00:29:27.092 --> 00:29:28.452
It'll be difficult to save him.

00:29:29.372 --> 00:29:31.372
I'll make a move.

00:29:32.932 --> 00:29:36.572
All of you give a hand.

00:29:37.252 --> 00:29:38.692
Come on. - Come on. Let us pick him up.

00:29:38.772 --> 00:29:40.652
Come on. - Come on. Let us pick him.

00:29:40.732 --> 00:29:43.812
Yes. Come on. Loknath. - Come on.
Come and give us a hand.

00:32:33.652 --> 00:32:37.892
Perhaps the fellow would have
been saved by your treatment.

00:32:40.092 --> 00:32:41.732
Now he has no chance of recovering.

00:32:48.292 --> 00:32:51.612
I've seen in my childhood,
in my village.

00:32:51.812 --> 00:32:53.012
The antics of an exorcist.

00:32:53.852 --> 00:32:57.012
It can make a fit man sick.

00:32:57.572 --> 00:33:00.212
He beats the patient hard with a broom.

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:04.572
For a moment I had
thought that you'll stay back.

00:33:05.292 --> 00:33:08.092
But then I thought that-

00:33:08.892 --> 00:33:12.572
you don't have the
experience of working in a village.

00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:15.092
You took the right decision.

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:21.812
Santosh !

00:33:22.852 --> 00:33:25.252
Turn the car. I'll go to "Kodal"

00:34:14.092 --> 00:34:15.372
Where is his house?

00:34:15.692 --> 00:34:17.452
No idea, Sir.

00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:20.052
I had picked them up
from near that tree.

00:34:20.372 --> 00:34:22.572
Maybe we will get it
if we go a little ahead.

00:34:24.052 --> 00:34:26.012
Get my bag.
- Yes, sir.

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:10.892
Elephants roaring Horses neighing

00:35:10.972 --> 00:35:15.012
The bugles sound a war cry

00:35:15.092 --> 00:35:18.332
Soldiers marching Chariotiers shouting

00:35:19.172 --> 00:35:23.212
King Ravana glittering in his Valour.

00:35:23.532 --> 00:35:26.172
Silken flag flying high

00:35:26.252 --> 00:35:29.372
It's golden glow driving away the night.

00:35:51.252 --> 00:35:55.532
Will you go or not ?

00:35:59.772 --> 00:36:01.612
I'll drive you away !

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:04.012
I will not spare you.

00:36:05.252 --> 00:36:06.772
Go away.

00:36:08.612 --> 00:36:10.692
What do you want?

00:36:13.132 --> 00:36:14.612
What do you want? Tell me.

00:36:15.092 --> 00:36:16.212
I will not spare you.
I will make you flee.

00:36:16.692 --> 00:36:18.772
I won't leave you till
you quit the village !

00:36:18.852 --> 00:36:23.572
I objected to all this. Nobody listened.

00:37:05.092 --> 00:37:07.612
Stop it..! Stop the madness.

00:37:10.852 --> 00:37:12.532
Stop it at once !

00:37:21.012 --> 00:37:25.012
Take him indoors immediately !

00:37:25.292 --> 00:37:28.612
If the torture continues,
he can't be saved.

00:37:31.012 --> 00:37:31.812
What happened?

00:37:33.172 --> 00:37:35.012
You heard what the doctor said.

00:37:35.092 --> 00:37:37.292
Take him indoors immediately !

00:37:38.052 --> 00:37:38.892
Come on. Make it quick.

00:37:39.012 --> 00:37:41.452
Come on, Jharna. Go. Come on, Kushto.

00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:45.852
Hold him by the waist.

00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:50.572
All of you please go home.

00:37:50.652 --> 00:37:53.612
There's nothing to see here.

00:37:53.692 --> 00:37:56.972
Get going, all of you. There is
nothing to watch here anymore.

00:37:57.132 --> 00:37:58.572
Go away. All of you, go home.
Come on. Come on.

00:38:02.172 --> 00:38:03.172
Listen !

00:38:04.132 --> 00:38:06.692
How much do you charge
for this mumbo-jumbo?

00:38:06.772 --> 00:38:08.492
Give whatever pleases you.

00:38:09.812 --> 00:38:11.972
Take this and push off !

00:38:21.452 --> 00:38:23.812
Take the pillow

00:38:25.732 --> 00:38:29.292
Please let me pass. Move.

00:38:31.972 --> 00:38:33.412
Don't crowd a patient's room.

00:38:33.452 --> 00:38:35.332
Those who've no work, please leave

00:38:35.572 --> 00:38:37.172
Come on. Loknath. Kushto.

00:38:37.252 --> 00:38:39.332
Yes, let us go. - Come on. Let us go.

00:38:39.652 --> 00:38:40.932
Hey, even you can leave. - Come on.

00:39:01.412 --> 00:39:02.052
Who are you ?

00:39:03.292 --> 00:39:04.492
She's Haladhar's daughter.

00:39:06.852 --> 00:39:08.692
- Where's her mother? - She's dead.

00:39:10.492 --> 00:39:12.532
And this is her brother?

00:39:13.212 --> 00:39:15.172
That's right. Raju.

00:39:17.492 --> 00:39:18.492
What's your name?

00:39:21.772 --> 00:39:22.532
Manashi.

00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:28.412
Listen carefully.

00:39:29.892 --> 00:39:32.932
Your father hasn't eaten for two days.

00:39:33.532 --> 00:39:35.412
He must be given something to eat.

00:39:36.372 --> 00:39:38.132
- Sabu ? - D'you have it?

00:39:38.932 --> 00:39:42.132
- Yes. -Then mix it with milk and give.

00:39:42.332 --> 00:39:45.892
And then give him sugar
solution at intervals.

00:39:46.372 --> 00:39:47.372
Do you have sugar?

00:39:48.332 --> 00:39:48.932
Sir.

00:39:51.732 --> 00:39:53.412
Now I'll examine your father.

00:40:49.092 --> 00:40:49.772
Okay.

00:40:52.772 --> 00:40:54.132
Prepare an injection.

00:40:54.532 --> 00:40:55.852
Delaphilinil. Decadrum.

00:41:01.332 --> 00:41:02.772
You must have heard...

00:41:03.892 --> 00:41:06.052
...that I found your
father by the wayside-

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.892
and arranged to bring him home.

00:41:11.732 --> 00:41:13.612
I have some work in Jamshedpur.

00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:16.812
It'll take me three
hours to reach there-

00:41:17.372 --> 00:41:18.652
so I must go.

00:41:19.652 --> 00:41:22.932
Before leaving I'll give
your father an injection.

00:41:24.812 --> 00:41:27.332
Do you understand ' Injection'?

00:41:28.772 --> 00:41:29.452
Yes.

00:41:30.532 --> 00:41:32.492
It will relieve him
of the breathlessness.

00:41:33.132 --> 00:41:36.652
He'll need other medicines too.

00:41:37.572 --> 00:41:40.332
I won't have the time to give those.

00:41:41.412 --> 00:41:44.292
Jatinbabu will call a doctor.
He'll take care of it.

00:41:45.292 --> 00:41:47.732
- Understood? - Understood

00:41:49.292 --> 00:41:51.172
Now go and bring the milk and Sabu.

00:42:31.252 --> 00:42:32.372
Let's wait for 15 minutes.

00:42:34.172 --> 00:42:35.132
You may go now.

00:42:36.252 --> 00:42:40.252
But leave the bag and the torch behind.
- O.K., Sir.

00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.772
Looks like pneumonia. Doesn't it ?

00:42:47.652 --> 00:42:48.892
How did you know ?

00:42:48.972 --> 00:42:51.492
My mother died of the same disease.

00:42:51.772 --> 00:42:54.052
Had called a doctor from "Ghatshila",

00:42:54.292 --> 00:42:56.612
...but it was no use.

00:42:58.732 --> 00:43:02.572
You mentioned about a doctor nearby
- how's he?

00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:04.612
More of an amateur.

00:43:05.052 --> 00:43:08.532
As far as health is concerned,
here we're left entirely

00:43:08.612 --> 00:43:09.932
on the mercy of God.

00:43:17.212 --> 00:43:20.252
Hasn't the govt set up
a health centre here?

00:43:20.332 --> 00:43:24.812
We've only heard of such
things Haven't seen one ourselves.

00:43:25.932 --> 00:43:28.732
These villages haven't
even been electrified.

00:43:38.292 --> 00:43:42.772
Will the fellow survive?
- This night is critical for him.

00:43:43.572 --> 00:43:45.372
Proper medicines haven't been given.

00:43:45.892 --> 00:43:47.812
You said you have some medicines.

00:43:48.452 --> 00:43:50.332
Yes, some antibiotics. But
those are strong medicines

00:43:51.332 --> 00:43:53.732
Have to be given at fixed hours.

00:43:54.612 --> 00:43:56.812
Will the girl be able to manage?

00:43:59.012 --> 00:44:01.572
I can take that responsibility.

00:44:03.972 --> 00:44:04.932
Let's see.

00:44:06.332 --> 00:44:10.452
We're hearing of this new disease
- aids.

00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:12.412
Is there a cure for it?

00:44:14.012 --> 00:44:16.092
It's a terrible and dangerous disease.

00:44:16.772 --> 00:44:18.972
Research is going on.

00:44:19.052 --> 00:44:21.852
But will you understand the details?

00:44:21.972 --> 00:44:23.092
True !

00:44:23.612 --> 00:44:25.652
But still I feel inquisitive.

00:44:26.572 --> 00:44:28.052
I teach maths and history.

00:44:28.612 --> 00:44:30.772
But my interest is varied.

00:44:31.412 --> 00:44:34.412
No library around to supply good books.

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:38.252
So newspaper is my only
source of information.

00:44:40.292 --> 00:44:42.212
Let's go back to the patient.

00:44:45.452 --> 00:44:47.212
You really can't stay back?

00:44:47.772 --> 00:44:48.812
No.

00:44:49.412 --> 00:44:53.772
I don't have the temperament
of treating rural patients.

00:44:58.692 --> 00:45:00.292
He seems to have improved a little.

00:45:02.172 --> 00:45:03.812
I had expected it.

00:45:04.812 --> 00:45:06.252
But where's the girl?

00:45:31.212 --> 00:45:32.092
Listen !

00:45:34.772 --> 00:45:36.252
Did you feed him ?

00:45:41.692 --> 00:45:43.212
So, I'll go now.

00:45:45.212 --> 00:45:47.452
I'm cooking your dinner.

00:45:51.412 --> 00:45:53.932
You did so much for my father

00:45:54.012 --> 00:45:55.532
Have dinner here before you go.

00:45:56.932 --> 00:45:59.092
But I'm in a hurry.

00:45:59.732 --> 00:46:01.892
It'll take only half an hour.

00:46:03.652 --> 00:46:05.452
You've put me in a fix.

00:46:05.852 --> 00:46:06.972
Please.

00:46:07.892 --> 00:46:09.092
Have dinner here.

00:46:10.972 --> 00:46:12.372
It'll be a sin for us if you don't.

00:46:13.492 --> 00:46:15.772
Such sentiments are obsolete

00:46:17.812 --> 00:46:20.732
Not in a village.

00:46:40.372 --> 00:46:44.092
Is there a telephone nearby?
- Yes, at the Chowdhuri's.

00:46:44.852 --> 00:46:46.132
How far is it?

00:46:46.332 --> 00:46:48.172
Half an hour by car.

00:46:58.652 --> 00:47:01.052
Alright, you keep the dinner ready.

00:47:01.412 --> 00:47:03.412
Meanwhile I'll go and ring up my friend.

00:47:04.052 --> 00:47:05.452
Let's go, Jatinbabu.

00:47:24.332 --> 00:47:26.452
You'll reach your destination by 11 P.M.

00:47:30.212 --> 00:47:31.332
Come in.

00:47:35.092 --> 00:47:38.332
I had only read about your
traditional hospitality.

00:47:38.972 --> 00:47:40.732
Today I witnessed it.

00:48:07.972 --> 00:48:09.132
Manashi !

00:48:12.572 --> 00:48:13.532
Manashi !

00:48:24.572 --> 00:48:25.612
Hey Manashi !

00:48:28.732 --> 00:48:30.132
You've again come to harass me ?

00:48:31.772 --> 00:48:35.212
I came to give you a good news.

00:48:35.332 --> 00:48:36.972
I've got a job.

00:48:37.052 --> 00:48:38.252
At the rice mill.

00:48:39.172 --> 00:48:40.252
What's that to me ?

00:48:42.172 --> 00:48:43.532
Why !

00:48:44.972 --> 00:48:47.692
Now I can take you away.

00:48:47.932 --> 00:48:50.412
We'll elope.

00:48:52.652 --> 00:48:55.212
Never say something like that again !

00:49:07.932 --> 00:49:09.252
Your father is ill.

00:49:11.732 --> 00:49:13.212
Your brother is at your father's side?

00:49:36.292 --> 00:49:38.492
Don't you dare enter the house.

00:49:42.572 --> 00:49:44.012
You're all alone !

00:49:45.012 --> 00:49:46.612
What do you want?

00:49:50.012 --> 00:49:54.452
I can't sleep well without meeting you.

00:50:02.212 --> 00:50:03.652
So, you won't come with me ?

00:50:05.012 --> 00:50:08.092
I'll take you away by force.

00:50:09.132 --> 00:50:11.932
I can't live without you !

00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:15.732
Get out !

00:50:15.932 --> 00:50:17.972
What are you doing?

00:50:18.052 --> 00:50:19.972
Get out of here !

00:50:20.412 --> 00:50:23.412
Get out. I am warning you.

00:50:24.132 --> 00:50:25.252
I will kill you.

00:50:25.892 --> 00:50:27.412
Acting smart? Get out.

00:50:37.292 --> 00:50:38.012
Sister !

00:50:43.052 --> 00:50:47.692
It's alright. You go to father.

00:50:51.132 --> 00:50:52.892
Listen.

00:50:53.652 --> 00:50:57.292
I've got stuck with a patient on my way.

00:50:59.292 --> 00:51:01.052
Ofcourse, I'm coming.

00:51:02.052 --> 00:51:03.692
I'll reach by 11 PM.

00:51:05.012 --> 00:51:06.972
Yes, I'll put up with you.

00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:10.292
There won't be much
time for gossiping today.

00:51:10.372 --> 00:51:12.572
Tomorrow we'll sit and talk.

00:51:14.652 --> 00:51:16.932
Yes, yes. I am saying it again.
I am extremely sorry.

00:51:18.012 --> 00:51:19.812
I'll come and explain.

00:51:22.892 --> 00:51:24.052
Bye for now.

00:51:25.292 --> 00:51:26.172
Fine.

00:51:26.492 --> 00:51:27.252
Okay.

00:52:02.732 --> 00:52:04.132
Raju, how's your dad?

00:52:04.612 --> 00:52:05.532
Sleeping.

00:52:05.892 --> 00:52:09.372
He had opened his eyes once.

00:52:27.772 --> 00:52:28.812
Who's there?

00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:39.292
Is that you, Jatin ?

00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:42.292
Yes, Mr. Sanyal Please come.

00:52:43.932 --> 00:52:49.012
Nobody informed me
about Haladhar's condition.

00:52:49.172 --> 00:52:50.092
No, I mean..

00:52:50.172 --> 00:52:54.092
I heard people discussing.
What a shame !

00:52:54.612 --> 00:52:55.532
Last time

00:53:02.132 --> 00:53:03.972
This is Dr. Sengupta.

00:53:04.492 --> 00:53:07.012
He found Haladhar by the way side.

00:53:08.172 --> 00:53:09.372
You're from Calcutta?

00:53:09.932 --> 00:53:10.652
Yes.

00:53:11.372 --> 00:53:12.252
Allopath?

00:53:12.972 --> 00:53:13.932
Yes, sir.

00:53:15.612 --> 00:53:19.412
- How many degrees after
your name? - Just a few.

00:53:25.652 --> 00:53:27.372
Have you diagnosed the disease?

00:53:28.332 --> 00:53:30.172
Looks like pneumonia.

00:53:31.572 --> 00:53:33.132
Has he taken medicines?

00:53:34.452 --> 00:53:36.692
I've given an injection
for the breathlessness.

00:53:36.972 --> 00:53:38.812
It seems to have helped him.

00:53:42.172 --> 00:53:43.692
How d'you find him?

00:53:44.252 --> 00:53:47.852
He was lying in the open for two days.

00:53:48.772 --> 00:53:50.412
Let's see his pulse.

00:54:15.292 --> 00:54:18.852
You're wasting your time here.

00:54:19.132 --> 00:54:23.012
Don't stay back to
suffer the mosquito bites.

00:54:23.732 --> 00:54:26.612
No medicine can cure him now.

00:54:26.972 --> 00:54:29.772
I'll leave for Jamshedpur soon.

00:54:30.052 --> 00:54:31.052
Then go there; proceed.

00:54:31.372 --> 00:54:33.452
I'll also make a move.

00:54:34.492 --> 00:54:35.972
Let us go.

00:54:36.292 --> 00:54:37.252
Mr. Khagen.

00:54:38.012 --> 00:54:38.692
Let it be. Let it be. You
needn't act now. I am leaving.

00:54:44.012 --> 00:54:46.412
Your dinner is ready.

00:54:48.492 --> 00:54:49.812
You too join us for dinner.

00:54:49.892 --> 00:54:52.892
No dear, I don't dine so early.

00:54:53.372 --> 00:54:55.612
He's getting late. Serve him dinner.

00:54:56.652 --> 00:55:00.332
Raju is here. I'll
join you after some time.

00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:01.812
All right.

00:55:01.892 --> 00:55:02.532
See you.

00:55:08.132 --> 00:55:08.572
See you.

00:55:24.332 --> 00:55:25.892
You're not used to this kind of food.

00:55:25.972 --> 00:55:26.772
It's delicious.

00:55:28.092 --> 00:55:30.732
Though I can't always
make out what I'm eating.

00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:32.092
Shall I name the items?

00:55:32.172 --> 00:55:36.852
No. A dish qualifies by
its taste, not its name.

00:55:39.572 --> 00:55:41.612
You must be having a cook at home.

00:55:41.692 --> 00:55:42.772
Yes, we do ...

00:55:43.492 --> 00:55:45.132
But my wife also cooks.

00:55:48.732 --> 00:55:50.692
How many children do you have?

00:55:51.412 --> 00:55:52.652
One son, one daughter.

00:55:53.332 --> 00:55:56.012
Son is the elder one. He's abroad.

00:55:57.172 --> 00:55:58.372
Daughter studies in a college.

00:56:01.652 --> 00:56:03.172
She's of your age.

00:56:07.252 --> 00:56:08.892
Don't give much.

00:56:09.692 --> 00:56:10.412
Enough. Enough.

00:56:24.492 --> 00:56:27.412
Will you tell frankly?
- What?

00:56:29.292 --> 00:56:30.932
How d'you find father?

00:56:33.892 --> 00:56:35.092
What do you feel?

00:56:38.972 --> 00:56:39.772
What do you feel?

00:56:40.852 --> 00:56:42.572
Me? I'm ill fated.

00:56:43.732 --> 00:56:45.372
I've lost my mother, husband.

00:56:46.332 --> 00:56:47.612
And now ...

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:50.892
How did your mother die?

00:56:53.772 --> 00:56:54.772
Of Malaria.

00:56:56.612 --> 00:56:58.212
A severe type.

00:57:00.732 --> 00:57:02.252
I feel a shiver down my spine-

00:57:02.612 --> 00:57:03.932
whenever I think of that day.

00:57:05.132 --> 00:57:06.572
Dad was absconding as usual-

00:57:07.212 --> 00:57:09.012
Raju was a babe.

00:57:10.932 --> 00:57:12.812
Mother died in front of my eyes.

00:57:14.572 --> 00:57:16.452
I cried uncontrollably.

00:57:18.772 --> 00:57:21.412
Where do so much tears come from ?

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.252
At last I realized-

00:57:26.612 --> 00:57:28.932
I've to take mother's place.

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:30.452
I pulled myself together,

00:57:32.692 --> 00:57:34.452
and wiped off my tears.

00:57:36.092 --> 00:57:39.332
I haven't cried since then.

00:57:40.492 --> 00:57:41.612
And your husband?

00:57:43.172 --> 00:57:45.412
He expired within a
year of our marriage.

00:57:46.172 --> 00:57:47.052
How did he die?

00:57:47.292 --> 00:57:49.612
He was bitten by a snake
- a Cobra.

00:57:57.932 --> 00:57:58.892
What are you thinking?

00:58:03.452 --> 00:58:04.172
About you.

00:58:04.492 --> 00:58:05.492
About me?

00:58:12.252 --> 00:58:14.012
Do you know that a 'nurse' means?

00:58:14.972 --> 00:58:15.892
Nurse?

00:58:17.252 --> 00:58:22.732
They work in hospitals,
look after patients.

00:58:24.172 --> 00:58:25.012
Yes.

00:58:25.532 --> 00:58:29.372
I think, with some training
you'll make a very good nurse.

00:58:31.172 --> 00:58:32.532
How does one become a nurse?

00:58:33.572 --> 00:58:34.612
One has to study.

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:37.852
Then you pass an exam.

00:58:37.932 --> 00:58:41.612
Take admission in a
hospital and get the training.

00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:45.372
I used to go to a primary school.

00:58:46.372 --> 00:58:47.692
I can read Bengali.

00:58:48.772 --> 00:58:50.612
And write a little.

00:58:52.052 --> 00:58:53.452
After mother died,

00:58:54.492 --> 00:58:55.932
I had to give up studies.

00:58:57.052 --> 00:58:58.932
You'll again resume studies.

00:58:59.772 --> 00:59:00.852
So what, if you're a little old.

00:59:04.332 --> 00:59:06.092
Do nurses earn a salary?

00:59:06.652 --> 00:59:08.532
Ofcourse !

00:59:10.452 --> 00:59:11.932
It feels good even to think about it.

00:59:12.892 --> 00:59:14.332
But how's all this possible?

00:59:14.692 --> 00:59:15.412
Listen.

00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:18.812
You'll look after your father

00:59:19.772 --> 00:59:22.652
as long as he's alive.

00:59:23.852 --> 00:59:25.332
When he's no more-

00:59:26.132 --> 00:59:28.812
I'll take both of you to Calcutta.

00:59:30.012 --> 00:59:31.932
I'll arrange for your studies.

00:59:34.052 --> 00:59:36.172
Only after I see you
in a nurse's uniform,

00:59:36.812 --> 00:59:38.052
I'll be at peace.

00:59:43.492 --> 00:59:45.052
You're going away.

00:59:47.932 --> 00:59:50.052
Will you remember us when you're away?

00:59:51.092 --> 00:59:52.052
I will.

00:59:53.212 --> 00:59:57.652
Today's experience has
been a unique one for me.

00:59:59.092 --> 01:00:00.572
I can never forget you all.

01:00:02.372 --> 01:00:03.812
I'll take your address-

01:00:04.732 --> 01:00:07.212
I'll write to you after ten days-

01:00:08.212 --> 01:00:09.732
Then I'll take a decision.

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:13.252
What is it?

01:00:20.132 --> 01:00:20.812
Okay.

01:00:25.612 --> 01:00:26.732
Let it be. That is enough.

01:00:30.092 --> 01:00:31.012
What about your dinner?

01:00:32.292 --> 01:00:33.812
I'll serve Raju first.

01:00:36.452 --> 01:00:37.252
Raju.

01:00:37.492 --> 01:00:38.212
Coming.

01:00:48.572 --> 01:00:51.132
- You had gone home? - Take this.

01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:52.972
Thermometer.

01:00:53.412 --> 01:00:56.332
You didn't cheek his
temperature even once.

01:00:56.972 --> 01:01:01.092
So I realized that you
don't have a thermometer.

01:01:13.012 --> 01:01:15.532
Manashi, hold your
father's hand tightly.

01:01:25.452 --> 01:01:29.132
You keep it with Manasi.
I'll collect it later.

01:01:29.572 --> 01:01:32.932
You take it back. I'll go now.

01:01:34.172 --> 01:01:35.692
Stay a little longer.

01:01:37.772 --> 01:01:38.932
I have a feeling,

01:01:39.692 --> 01:01:41.332
whatever happens will happen tonight.

01:01:44.612 --> 01:01:46.652
Why don't you call-

01:01:46.732 --> 01:01:49.652
some neighbour over to spend the night?

01:01:50.892 --> 01:01:54.972
Nobody likes my father.

01:01:58.332 --> 01:02:02.172
Please don't make any
more request to me, Manashi.

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:06.652
I did what I could.

01:02:07.692 --> 01:02:09.292
You must try to understand.

01:02:10.332 --> 01:02:11.852
I can stay the night.

01:02:12.652 --> 01:02:15.372
Then I'll have to go home and tell them.

01:02:16.412 --> 01:02:17.172
Let it be.

01:02:18.412 --> 01:02:22.332
I'll manage. You've already done a lot.

01:02:24.652 --> 01:02:26.092
If there's a crisis, I'll send for you.

01:02:28.532 --> 01:02:32.852
I could have halted
here on my return trip-

01:02:33.772 --> 01:02:37.532
but I have a lot of
work pending at Calcutta.

01:02:41.452 --> 01:02:43.412
Then give me the medicine.

01:02:46.812 --> 01:02:48.052
You have it, don't you?

01:02:49.252 --> 01:02:51.612
It's not easy to
administer that medicine.

01:02:53.132 --> 01:02:55.092
If you show me, I'll do it.

01:03:20.012 --> 01:03:20.692
Come here.

01:03:26.572 --> 01:03:28.772
Do you see how they are packed?

01:03:30.212 --> 01:03:32.572
You press from above
and they'll come out.

01:03:33.772 --> 01:03:34.452
Give me.

01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:46.212
Is it all right ?

01:03:48.052 --> 01:03:48.692
Yes.

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.412
There are eight capsules.

01:03:52.012 --> 01:03:53.612
Give one every four hours.

01:03:53.692 --> 01:03:55.492
Make him swallow it with water.

01:03:57.252 --> 01:03:58.892
There are enough for tomorrow.

01:03:59.412 --> 01:04:02.212
Shall I give him one now?
- Yes.

01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:13.172
Dad.

01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:14.412
Dad.

01:04:17.132 --> 01:04:17.932
Dad.

01:04:21.452 --> 01:04:24.412
Dad, open your mouth.

01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:26.892
You've to take a pill.

01:04:31.292 --> 01:04:32.612
Please open your mouth.

01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:46.132
Now swallow it.

01:05:05.772 --> 01:05:07.132
So I'll make a move now.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:13.412
All right

01:05:30.492 --> 01:05:32.852
Will the medicine help?

01:05:33.652 --> 01:05:35.092
His condition detoriorated...

01:05:35.172 --> 01:05:36.812
...during those two unattended days.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:39.612
If you could stay a little longer !

01:05:39.652 --> 01:05:43.532
That's out of question;
I've already told you.

01:05:50.612 --> 01:05:53.572
I enjoyed your company.

01:05:54.172 --> 01:05:55.572
So did I.

01:05:56.012 --> 01:05:56.532
I am leaving.

01:05:58.452 --> 01:05:59.252
Greetings.

01:05:59.972 --> 01:06:00.812
Greetings.

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:21.252
The Sun has set

01:06:21.332 --> 01:06:24.172
A soft twilight glow fills the sky

01:06:24.252 --> 01:06:26.612
As the white water lilies bloom,

01:06:26.772 --> 01:06:29.332
The lotus closes its eye

01:06:32.172 --> 01:06:35.252
The birds return to their nests

01:06:40.252 --> 01:06:44.172
And cows to their sheds

01:06:47.852 --> 01:06:51.692
The first star twinkles in the sky.

01:06:52.572 --> 01:06:55.692
So, you forgot
completely that we're here !

01:06:56.412 --> 01:07:00.052
It slips out of one's mind.
We've not met for 10 years !

01:07:00.172 --> 01:07:01.852
So, you were held up.

01:07:02.132 --> 01:07:04.652
Have you started
practising in the village ?

01:07:05.972 --> 01:07:11.052
As far as I know you,
you are fiercely urban.

01:07:11.572 --> 01:07:13.932
Never had these idealisms.

01:07:14.652 --> 01:07:15.772
I still don't have.

01:07:16.372 --> 01:07:18.332
But this time, I couldn't turn my back.

01:07:18.732 --> 01:07:19.892
The tyre was punctured.

01:07:20.572 --> 01:07:23.412
I saw a farmer lying by the side

01:07:23.492 --> 01:07:24.772
His condition was critical.

01:07:24.852 --> 01:07:27.252
He could hardly breathe.

01:07:28.132 --> 01:07:31.532
I couldn't leave him unattended.

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.772
You attend to the highest classes.

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:39.812
You can't afford to attend to farmers.

01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:41.452
What are you saying ?!

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:43.812
He's an urban doctor doesn't mean-

01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:45.452
that he's devoid of feelings.

01:07:46.372 --> 01:07:48.292
Everybody feels sorry for the poor.

01:07:49.092 --> 01:07:51.332
You know, Nikhil is not wrong.

01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:53.652
I am city born and city bred.

01:07:54.012 --> 01:07:55.972
I can't stand village life.

01:07:58.332 --> 01:07:59.492
But I don't know why.

01:08:01.372 --> 01:08:04.612
On seeing the poor fellow-

01:08:04.652 --> 01:08:05.932
I suddenly remembered-

01:08:07.452 --> 01:08:10.732
the Hippocratic Oath we'd
taken during graduation.

01:08:11.732 --> 01:08:12.612
What's that?

01:08:12.972 --> 01:08:15.732
Well, medical students have-

01:08:15.812 --> 01:08:18.052
to take some oaths during graduation.

01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:20.172
It's a Greek tradition.

01:08:22.692 --> 01:08:24.732
Whatsoever house I enter..

01:08:25.892 --> 01:08:28.772
..there will I go for
the benefit of the sick.

01:08:30.412 --> 01:08:33.532
Refraining from all wrong doing..

01:08:33.612 --> 01:08:34.972
..and corruption.

01:08:35.252 --> 01:08:36.572
Did the patient survive?

01:08:39.012 --> 01:08:39.852
Don't know.

01:08:42.772 --> 01:08:44.532
This night is very crucial.

01:08:45.812 --> 01:08:49.212
Just because I had
promised you, I came away-

01:08:49.852 --> 01:08:51.812
giving some medicines and
instructions to his daughter.

01:08:52.852 --> 01:08:54.452
Who else is there?

01:08:55.852 --> 01:08:58.612
His wife is dead, he has a young son,

01:08:58.932 --> 01:09:01.012
and the daughter I told
you about she's widow-

01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:07.332
She's about seventeen ... remarkable.

01:09:09.892 --> 01:09:10.812
Why?

01:09:11.372 --> 01:09:13.372
Why remarkable?

01:09:15.492 --> 01:09:18.012
I was comparing her with my daughter.

01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:23.852
If I hadn't given you word,
I would have stayed back.

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:26.292
Nonsense.

01:09:26.932 --> 01:09:28.972
Doctors shouldn't have such sentiments.

01:09:29.612 --> 01:09:32.652
Daily thousands are dying
for lack of medical care.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.692
What can you do alone?

01:09:37.012 --> 01:09:39.172
That is why, I'm practising in the city.

01:09:39.612 --> 01:09:40.532
Right.

01:09:40.772 --> 01:09:42.572
And that is the end of the argument.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:47.292
It's past midnight. Let's go to bed.

01:09:48.492 --> 01:09:50.932
Give me your glass.

01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:53.012
Do you take bed tea?

01:09:53.332 --> 01:09:55.852
No, I'll directly take breakfast.

01:09:56.532 --> 01:09:58.492
Both of us will go for your talk.

01:09:58.572 --> 01:10:00.732
Sure.

01:10:00.812 --> 01:10:02.372
You are most welcome.
Shall we sleep now? Good night.

01:10:02.452 --> 01:10:03.412
Good night. - Good night.

01:10:18.612 --> 01:10:20.932
Daddy, swallow the pill.

01:10:54.852 --> 01:10:58.932
While the kingdom of demons celebrates

01:11:00.292 --> 01:11:07.052
Sita pines for her dear one

01:11:08.652 --> 01:11:13.212
All alone in the Ashoka woods,

01:11:13.532 --> 01:11:20.972
Her guards desert her
to join the merrymaking.

01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:55.652
Dear Nikhil.

01:11:55.732 --> 01:12:00.732
I haven't done a
really good deed in my life.

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:06.492
Today I have found an
opportunity to do one.

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:11.252
I'll be back by 10 AM tomorrow
- Neehar.

01:13:06.532 --> 01:13:07.412
Manashi.

01:13:14.452 --> 01:13:15.212
Manashi.

01:13:29.092 --> 01:13:30.772
Doctor. You?

01:13:34.092 --> 01:13:36.292
I had dozed off.

01:14:12.732 --> 01:14:13.772
Father..

01:14:18.012 --> 01:14:19.532
Be strong, Manashi

01:14:24.652 --> 01:14:27.692
I know, I know.

01:14:32.292 --> 01:14:33.292
I know.

01:15:31.972 --> 01:15:36.692
Will you be able to
make all arrangements ?

01:15:40.372 --> 01:15:41.412
Yes

01:15:44.212 --> 01:15:45.532
Then I'll go.

01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:55.452
I'll write to you.

01:16:00.532 --> 01:16:04.612
We've given you so much trouble

01:16:09.852 --> 01:16:11.132
Trouble !

01:16:15.692 --> 01:16:18.012
I can't explain to you-

01:16:19.372 --> 01:16:21.292
what I've gained in this one day.

01:16:27.252 --> 01:16:29.292
Farewell, little nurse?

01:18:22.252 --> 01:18:26.292
