<i>A thirty year old story which
strained Kolkata police.</i>

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:06.174
<i>Is that coming back
or just a sign?</i>

COUNTER-ATTACK

"The Stoneman diary"?

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.429
<i>Why will you have bad things like 
cigarettes, beedis and tobacco?</i>

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:25.191
<i>They cause cancer.
Have nice things like Roshogolla.</i>

KALIKA IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU
11th SEPTEMBER 1970 - 7th MARCH 2017

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:37.333
Don't you have a home?

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.125
Why are you roaming hither and thither?

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:42.250
What do I do?
You never stop to sing.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.125
You're roaming and singing …
I'm roaming and listening.

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.583
Will you not sing any more?

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:47.875
What do I gain from that?

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.083
But you're a fakir!

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:53.208
Good heavens! My mind is fakir,
not my belly!

00:05:53.208 --> 00:05:55.458
People give me something or
the other for my singing...

00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:56.750
What will you give?

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.542
Me?

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:00.792
Aaa …

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.958
Take this … it's 'monda'!
Take! Take!

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.500
Gosh! This is rich man's food!
Will it suit my belly?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.875
Mother says whatever the food is,
you should have respect for it.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.583
She's right!
Absolutely true!

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:42.292
You'll continue to give 'monda' to
all throughout your life.

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:45.375
Only give?
Shall I not have them too?

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:51.125
Not all people come to this world to eat.

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.125
Some come to feed others.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:56.250
Your work will be to feed everyone...

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:07.833
<i>Rosogolla...</i>

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:29.542
Oh my my!

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:33.042
My little one, what will you be?

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:35.042
Pick up!
Come here! Here! Here!

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.083
Kartikda!

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.292
O Kartikda!

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:41.667
What's up?

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:46.958
Bring the fried shrimps.
I'll add them to the mochaar ghanto.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.917
What're you doing?
Mixing non-veg in a veg item?

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:51.583
Oh! Mixing food with food.

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.375
Don't spare words! Just give it.

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:56.042
Those are worms.
No one adds them to mocha.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.542
Never happens like that.

00:07:57.542 --> 00:07:59.583
Never happens, is it?

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:03.542
That's what you're saying Kartikda?

00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:04.667
Didn't I tell you it doesn't work?

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:06.750
It does.
What?

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.208
From now on, it'll work.

00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:31.750
Harisadhan, is this feast for your grandson's
naming ceremony or his marriage?

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.250
It's awesome! Just awesome!

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:39.042
Harisadhan! Would you please
call your cook?

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:41.833
I'll give him a reward of
whole one rupee.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:45.250
What're you saying?
He'll become rich!

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.458
I'm calling him.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:50.125
Kartik! Come here for once!

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:57.792
Being extremely pleased with your
preparations, they want to reward you.

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.375
Me?

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:01.458
A whole rupee!

00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.875
Take this.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.708
Ok, then Harisadhan!
Now we'll take leave of you.

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:12.583
Bye! Please come again!

00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:13.792
Oh sure!

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.708
Fed on my money you've grown
to be a fat pig...

00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:31.042
And now you're seeking
explanation from me?

00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:35.792
What answer do I have?
What do you want me to say –

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:38.250
That my nephew works
in the kitchen like a woman.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.208
And it fills my heart with pride?

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:43.125
Then why do people engage
male cooks for cooking?

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:45.542
They get money for cooking.

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:47.208
And it is their job.

00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:48.583
Strange!

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:50.792
If you earn for your job,
you're a man...

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:52.792
If you don't, you're a woman?

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.708
Hey! Please stop!

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:55.708
What kind of a logic is this?

00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:58.500
Yes Aunty!
You better take him away!

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.625
Look at that! He has learnt the art
of quarrelling like a woman!

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:04.500
Well...

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.500
Since I'll have to be a man,
brother, I've decided

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.167
From now on I'll not
cook for this house.

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:13.792
No!

00:10:13.792 --> 00:10:15.208
I'll work in a sweetmeat shop.

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:18.000
In seven generations, no one
in our family has done such work.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.625
And you're planning to become
a 'moira' (a sweetmeat maker)?

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:21.792
'Moira'?

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:24.375
But brother!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.500
He'll have to
get engaged in some work.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.167
Did you see that?

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:34.042
Only you have spoiled him!

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:36.500
If you do that,
from this day onwards,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.000
I'll have no relationship with you two.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.958
I…

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.458
...will … become...

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.667
… a … 'moira'.

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.375
From today that's the end of
all my relations with you!

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:54.542
You two are no one for me.

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:56.500
Is that it?
Yes, it is.

00:10:57.458 --> 00:11:00.583
Is that it?
I've already said that.

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:04.542
Good! Ma, from today you'll
have less hard work to do.

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:11.708
Why are you so afraid?

00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:17.167
Do I have to listen to
them as I'm fatherless?

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:19.167
But I've my fears.

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.750
What's the use of
quarrelling with others?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.958
You're coward! Not me.

00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.417
And listen Ma! Till today,
what has he done for us?

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:32.500
Eh! They stay upstairs doing nothing...
I don't need such relations.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.125
I only want you to do good work.

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:37.833
Work?

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:40.125
Who will give me work?

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:41.542
Why?

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:46.083
Just now you were boasting of
becoming a 'moira'.

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:48.167
Oh! I said it just for that!

00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.500
I knew it.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.000
I've already told Reba...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.583
to inform me of any vacancy
in her husband's shop.

00:11:56.583 --> 00:12:01.375
She said – if she tells her husband,
it'll be done.

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:04.250
Kalidas Indra's sweet shop?

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.000
Yes.
In Bagbazar?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.750
Yes.
Very large sweet shop Ma!

00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:14.583
Kalidas Indra!

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:16.542
Will he appoint me?

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:21.750
Some people still listen to your
coward mother.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.375
Oh Ma! You're my
sepoy of Barrackpore!

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:28.792
It's hurting!
Leave! Leave me!

00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:52.333
I can make banana flower
with shrimps,

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:55.250
Hot spicy fried poppy seed pellets,
Kalai pulses with hing...

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.333
Did I ask you?

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.042
Chingri boi khilli,

00:12:58.042 --> 00:12:59.583
Jalpai chatney with coconut,

00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:01.958
Murhi ghanto...
Did I want to know?

00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.083
Nnnn...

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.917
No!
If you want to work here...

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:08.458
no unnecessary word!

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:12.625
When I'm not there,

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.375
you'll help them in the sale of goods.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:19.000
A notebook is there,
Where all the prices are written.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.375
See it! Memorize!

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:23.000
Don't search the notebook
in front of a customer.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.792
And if I find any discrepancy
in the accounts,

00:13:25.792 --> 00:13:28.458
I'll cut it from your salary.

00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:30.583
Shall I...

00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:32.917
Shall I not make sweets?

00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:34.500
Sweets?

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:38.292
You can make?
How old are you?

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:41.333
Twenty.

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:42.875
Mahesh! Hemen!

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:44.250
Coming!

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:47.875
Show him the workshop!

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:58.125
Come warrior! Come!

00:14:01.042 --> 00:14:03.500
I was saying …

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.500
a little honey and kismis (dried grapes)

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.292
sprinkled on these would have
made a marvel – isn't it?

00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:10.792
And some cashew …
Tell the master …

00:14:10.792 --> 00:14:12.417
Not one slap will miss your cheeks.

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:15.458
Do all those marvels when
you start your own shop.

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:17.833
I was just …
Hold this!

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:19.875
Go!

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:26.083
Nobinbabu!
Yes!

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:30.250
I was about to go!

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:35.667
Don't tell about your
own ideas to others!

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.292
It will make him angry like
a red hot iron.

00:14:39.292 --> 00:14:40.917
What are you saying?

00:14:40.917 --> 00:14:43.375
Nothing! What did I say?

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:49.208
First do it to show them
what you want to do.

00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:50.833
In spite of that those
who will see your work...

00:14:50.833 --> 00:14:52.792
will get angry like a red hot iron.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:54.917
Chatterbox!
Babbling the whole day!

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:57.583
Come on!
Do your own work!

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.125
Kismis is there in that box down there!

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:21.583
<i>Once Rama had said …</i>

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.167
Be satisfied with this
much...

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.417
Who are you?

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:03.250
Thief.
Tttttt … Thief! Thief!

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.625
Oh! No no no!

00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:06.792
Hide and seek?

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:07.792
Thief of that game.

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:10.417
Oh!

00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:11.958
See outside!
What?

00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.375
Asking you to look outside!

00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:22.125
Did you see? Fatty?

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:27.000
Yes. He's the actual thief
looking for me!

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.125
Hey! Hey!

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:31.708
Is he looking this side?

00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:36.500
Hmm! Looking this side.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.917
Is he coming this way?

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.417
Good that he takes
six months to move.

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:51.875
Relieved! He's gone!

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.292
Now you can go peacefully!

00:16:53.292 --> 00:16:55.958
He may be still hiding there...

00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.750
to catch me as soon as
I come out.

00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:04.083
A person has come for so long
can't you even offer her a glass of water?

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:05.292
Is it my house?

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:08.417
Don't you know guest is God?

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.583
What are you mumbling?

00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:17.792
No! Nothing!

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:19.625
What at all are you doing?

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:21.792
Nothing! Doing my work!

00:17:21.792 --> 00:17:25.667
Do your own work damn it!
Why're you after him?

00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:34.500
What's the name of that sweet?

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.667
What?
That one! What's its name?

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.167
'Khirer sandesh'.

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:41.792
Let's see! Give me one.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.875
There the kismis is my addition.

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.292
It's not so good!

00:17:58.292 --> 00:18:00.042
Oh my my! Not good?

00:18:00.042 --> 00:18:02.083
No.
Wait.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.333
Just have this!

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:10.083
This is good …

00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:44.875
Who makes such sweets?

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:47.167
Had sixteen sweets?

00:18:47.708 --> 00:18:49.083
Not one satisfied you?

00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:52.292
The worker is unripe! Young!

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:54.708
No no no! I do not make these.

00:18:54.708 --> 00:18:57.250
All of them are by Hemenda.
He's nearing 40 …

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.042
Can't do a thing properly!

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:01.167
If he couldn't learn in all this time,

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:02.958
he'll never do it.

00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.583
Why are you laughing?

00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:08.333
Look outside for fatty!

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.208
Is he there?

00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:12.167
Ok. I'm seeing!

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:14.458
How sweet!

00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:23.500
The road is clear.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.292
I'm assuring you!
Don't have to worry!

00:19:25.292 --> 00:19:26.417
Now you can peacefully …

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.667
Peace …

00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:33.250
Here you're … hey... hey …

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.875
Stop!

00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:40.875
What's this?

00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:43.708
What are you doing?

00:19:57.042 --> 00:19:59.875
Is she a girl or a demon?

00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:02.583
Not one, not two …
gobbled up sixteen sweets?

00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:04.583
Sixteen?

00:20:04.583 --> 00:20:06.875
I know he is blind,
but what were you all doing?

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:09.042
What can I say Master,

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.625
You mean that little girl...

00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:14.042
Slightly flabby...
With untied locks...

00:20:14.042 --> 00:20:15.792
Yes! Yes!

00:20:15.792 --> 00:20:18.292
Has a commanding tone...
Isn't it?

00:20:18.292 --> 00:20:22.125
Yes... she is Bhola Moira's
granddaughter.

00:20:22.125 --> 00:20:25.917
Did I ask you whether she is
granddaughter or a ghost?

00:20:25.917 --> 00:20:27.708
Bring the price!

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:30.333
Otherwise, since you've fed her
the sweets to please her

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.167
I'll deduct the money from your salary.
Understand?

00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:33.833
Your habit is to please people.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.125
You are like a
performer (shong) of Jelepara.

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:38.750
I'll leave you with the shongs of
Kansharipara... during the Pujas next year –

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.000
you'll sing and dance to make
people happy, Ok?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.708
Out!
Ok!

00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:45.250
Get out!

00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:49.417
Kit kit kit kit …

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.333
Hey you've stepped on the line!

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:56.792
Bearer stop the carriage.

00:20:56.792 --> 00:20:58.708
Hey girl!

00:20:58.708 --> 00:21:00.125
This side … look …

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.125
Come!

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.875
Do you know in which direction
is Bhola Moira's house?

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:12.083
I know it...

00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:15.208
It's near the palace in Shobhabazar.

00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:16.958
Shobhabazar?

00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.167
But we were told it's Bagbazar.

00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:20.917
I'm speaking.
You keep mum.

00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:24.500
It's just beside the palace
of Shobhabazar.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.167
But why are you going there...
to enjoy a musical soiree?

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:28.792
No no no!

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:33.792
Going for the matchmaking
of my son!

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.750
O! Matchmaking!

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.750
With the granddaughter of
Bhola Moira.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.125
O! Granddaughter!

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:45.917
But reach there before the sun...
comes up on the top of your head.

00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:47.292
Why, my dear?

00:21:47.292 --> 00:21:50.542
When the sun comes on top,
temperature of her head also rises.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.958
At that time she creates
slight problems.

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.042
What problem does she create?

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.375
Who doesn't bite if he/she
is mentally deranged?

00:21:56.375 --> 00:22:01.042
Before you, at least 20 people had
gone after being snapped.

00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:03.583
But the girl is very good!

00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:06.208
Oh mother!

00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:10.708
Go if you want to,
but come back before the sunset.

00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:12.042
Why my dear?

00:22:12.042 --> 00:22:14.125
Whenever the sun sets,
a spirit takes over her.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:15.500
Spirit!

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.750
Yes! Spirits come and enter her head!

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.875
But there's no harm in it!

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:22.667
She starts searching for trees
where spirits live.

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:24.083
Maaaaaaa!

00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:25.958
But she's a very good girl!

00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:27.792
You stay here.

00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:29.292
How do you know about her
from such a distance?

00:22:29.292 --> 00:22:31.667
Only me? Everyone knows.

00:22:31.667 --> 00:22:35.375
Hey everyone! Tell them!

00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:44.208
Turn the palanquin (palki).

00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:46.500
Quick!

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.708
Ram... Ram... Ram!

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.875
Softly!

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:57.833
Let's go!

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.667
Money!

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:44.167
<i>Kanai, why didn't you come...
In spite of your promise.</i>

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:54.917
<i>When the tie of Braja
has slackened.</i>

00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:14.208
<i>I've had to bear so much of pain,
my friend...</i>

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:18.000
<i>As the days of spring
fled away.</i>

00:24:25.542 --> 00:24:28.042
<i>So many days have gone by...</i>

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:34.875
<i>On the path of the cowherd...
so many days have gone by...</i>

00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:39.792
<i>But the notes of that flute
could never be heard!</i>

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.667
<i>Hundred flowers bloomed...
and dropped in the garden.</i>

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:51.708
<i>But he never came...
with the nupur tied on his feet!</i>

00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:59.167
<i>Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha!</i>

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.458
<i>Have cast a net in the water of my mind...
to catch you this time.</i>

00:25:20.458 --> 00:25:23.875
<i>Forget the world and come to me
you butter thief.</i>

00:25:31.042 --> 00:25:34.583
<i>Have set a trap under the Kadam tree
to fasten you with my tears.</i>

00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:38.083
<i>Forget the world and come to me
you butter thief.</i>

00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:48.333
<i>Chant the name of the Lord (Hari)!</i>

00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:20.542
Stop! Stop!

00:26:20.542 --> 00:26:23.000
Tell me! Where had you been?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.042
See, how she is romping around!

00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:27.208
Lost the poise of a girl!
Already fifteen years...

00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:28.708
but doesn't have any sense as yet!

00:26:28.708 --> 00:26:30.917
Don't you know your in-laws to be
are coming to see you today?

00:26:30.917 --> 00:26:33.083
And what are you doing?

00:26:33.083 --> 00:26:34.958
Look! She is so
much younger to you...

00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:35.750
even she is married.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.375
Your marriage will never happen.
Come! Come inside!

00:26:39.375 --> 00:26:41.375
Aaaa! My money!

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:43.708
Aei! Who are you my son?

00:26:43.708 --> 00:26:46.042
I'm Nobin Chandra Das.

00:26:46.042 --> 00:26:47.958
I work in the shop of Kalidas Indra.

00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:50.625
Well and good!
But what do you want me to do?

00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:52.458
She ate sixteen sweets and …

00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:53.583
Aei aei!

00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:54.667
Shut up!

00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.750
Had sixteen sweets, you see!

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.083
Didn't pay, isn't it?

00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:02.292
Wait! A good treat is waiting for you!

00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.667
Yes, my son!
How much is your bill?

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:06.583
Quarter of an anna, mother!

00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:07.958
Take this, my son!

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:15.167
Oi! Come to the room!
I'll give you a good lesson today!

00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:22.250
<i>Yamuna, are you the same
Yamuna that flows away?</i>

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:29.500
<i>On whose shore of beauty sold
the most precious blue stone?</i>

00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:41.333
Do you hold such performances
here regularly?

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:43.042
Why do you ask?
Do you sing?

00:27:43.042 --> 00:27:46.083
No no no!
Sometimes I just play the khol.

00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:47.958
Is it?

00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:50.542
Then please come one day.

00:27:50.542 --> 00:27:51.875
Play with me!

00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:54.250
I work in a shop!

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.875
So it's difficult to find time.

00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:58.208
Whenever I find time,
I'll definitely come.

00:27:58.208 --> 00:28:00.667
Be sure to come!

00:28:00.667 --> 00:28:03.000
I'll wait for you with
thirsty eyes!

00:28:10.042 --> 00:28:12.583
<i>Yamuna, are you the same
Yamuna that flows away?</i>

00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:17.208
Are you a 'moira' (sweetmeat maker)
or a robber, eh?

00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:18.833
I'm not a thief like you.
Me a thief?

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:20.167
Cheating a good person like
my mother?

00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:21.500
Give the money.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.625
No! No! No!
Not the money!

00:28:24.417 --> 00:28:25.708
Oh! My father!

00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:31.292
Now I can make out...

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:33.167
whatever you said to the palanquin
riders is absolutely true.

00:28:33.167 --> 00:28:35.375
Eh! Tall talker!

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:37.833
Have come to take money for
those trashy sweets?

00:28:37.833 --> 00:28:40.917
Trashy sweets?
That's why you gobbled up 16 of them.

00:28:42.292 --> 00:28:44.667
I was expecting a good one.

00:28:44.667 --> 00:28:47.250
Just look!
Please! Look here!

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.458
I'm not taking your money.

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:51.417
You offer me a good sweet first...

00:28:51.417 --> 00:28:54.000
and I'll return your money.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.875
How do you expect your good
sweet to be?

00:28:57.875 --> 00:28:59.875
Good sweet...

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:07.833
<i>Not sticky, this sweet is a boon...
as bright as the moon!</i>

00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:10.167
<i>Filled with ras (sugar syrup),
delightfully soft...</i>

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:12.625
<i>When put in the mouth makes people
forget their pains and sorrows.</i>

00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:15.083
<i>All people good and bad
will declare openly...</i>

00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:17.833
<i>It can't be found anywhere in the world...</i>

00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:21.167
<i>Want such a sweet from Nobin Moira!</i>

00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:27.292
So you can rhyme?

00:29:27.292 --> 00:29:30.125
Yes, if the sweet is not right,
I can also cut throats.

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:34.000
So, not sticky …

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.042
Delightfully soft …

00:29:35.042 --> 00:29:37.125
Luminous white …

00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:39.375
Y…e…s … a ball of ras!

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:41.417
Not to be found anywhere in the world.

00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:42.458
Will it happen?

00:29:42.458 --> 00:29:45.292
Don't forget my money
for the sweets you had!

00:29:45.292 --> 00:29:47.417
It will...!

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.417
It will...!

00:30:06.542 --> 00:30:08.458
Will it be possible?

00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.208
It will!

00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:16.333
"Like the moon" … means round.

00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:18.083
"Luminous white" …

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:20.667
So it can't be condensed milk …
Must be posset.

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:25.833
See! I'll make a new sweetmeat!

00:30:25.833 --> 00:30:28.042
Just like this!

00:30:28.042 --> 00:30:29.958
A syrupy ball...

00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:31.292
A sweatmeat from snack?

00:30:31.292 --> 00:30:33.083
Ah! No!

00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:35.167
It'll be round like this.

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:37.542
'Aam pana' (mango cordial),
'Kachauri pana' (water hyacinth)

00:30:37.542 --> 00:30:39.375
'Chand pana' (like the moon)

00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:40.917
A sweet from the moon?

00:30:40.917 --> 00:30:42.333
Who said that?

00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:44.083
From posset.

00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:49.292
Listen! Tomorrow morning
I need some posset and sugar.

00:30:49.292 --> 00:30:52.750
I'll give you posset, sugar… everything...
give me my snack back.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.167
Eat!

00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:56.042
Round balls!

00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:09.208
Ram! Ram!

00:32:04.208 --> 00:32:05.333
Listen...

00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:07.125
Uh! Maheshdada!
Please let me think!

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.208
It's not happening!

00:32:14.917 --> 00:32:18.708
Stop this nonsense!
If I've to talk every now and then …

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:20.167
What's being done?

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:23.375
I'm mmmmmm …

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:24.750
What are you?

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.833
A ram?

00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:29.208
Trying to make a new mishti...

00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:31.667
With only posset,

00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:33.833
Delicately soft...
Why only posset?

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:36.583
If I use cream,
It'll not be soft.

00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:38.583
So, I thought of using posset...
How do you know?

00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.000
I know.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.167
That's why I was making balls …
You know?

00:32:42.167 --> 00:32:43.625
You know so much,
but it never occurred to you

00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:45.833
that posset, if not
fried cannot soak syrup?

00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:47.833
But when fried,
it will not remain white …

00:32:47.833 --> 00:32:50.375
That's why …
You know better than me?

00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:52.708
Better than even Bhim Nag?

00:32:52.708 --> 00:32:56.292
Bhim Nag fried it to make
Lady Canning's sweet.

00:32:56.292 --> 00:33:00.083
A novice like you would have
spoiled it!

00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.333
I was trying it in a new way …

00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:02.667
New way … new way …

00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:04.417
Will win the world
at the age of twenty!

00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:06.750
Young Bengal...!

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.167
There is nothing to invent.
See what others are doing and copy it!

00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:10.458
Making new sweet!

00:33:10.458 --> 00:33:13.833
All over Bengal so many people
are trying so many new things …

00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:15.792
if we try to make a new mishti...

00:33:19.042 --> 00:33:22.458
Stealing my posset and talking tall?

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:27.625
If I see any insolence
you'll be thrown out.

00:33:29.333 --> 00:33:31.083
Mahesh!
Babu!

00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:38.500
I don't need any novelty on jamai
shashthi, at the Dutta's of Bagbazar.

00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:20.708
Such a vast Ganga but
don't you find a place to throw your waste?

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.500
I meant to call you up.

00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:29.167
Hey! Don't you have anything to do?

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.083
You said – "it'll happen".

00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:33.917
What will happen?
Syrupy ball or a frog head?

00:34:33.917 --> 00:34:35.875
When I've said it'll happen, it'll happen.

00:34:35.875 --> 00:34:37.417
– the syrupy ball.

00:34:37.417 --> 00:34:38.417
I'll not stop before I do it.

00:34:38.417 --> 00:34:42.167
Eh! As if you're a moving train!
Zik zik zik zik … won't stop!

00:34:42.167 --> 00:34:44.458
Stop it!
Why? Why should I?

00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:47.375
A competent person is always at work.

00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:49.875
They do not waste time
in measuring Ganga water.

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:53.083
What are you doing here?

00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:54.583
As if you've a lot of work!

00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:55.792
Then go!

00:34:55.792 --> 00:34:57.667
Climb the shaora tree!

00:34:57.667 --> 00:35:01.167
Ok then! Feel the pinch!
A mad girl... a bad girl!

00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:09.917
Please don't throw!

00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:11.625
Forgive me!

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.208
See how it feels!

00:35:15.208 --> 00:35:16.208
Go!

00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:20.458
Oh! Saved!

00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:25.667
If your words are not sweet,
how will your hands make sweets?

00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:29.375
Is it the way to talk to girls?

00:35:30.167 --> 00:35:34.042
The 'moira' who doesn't
behave sweetly,

00:35:34.042 --> 00:35:36.417
can't make sweets!

00:35:39.792 --> 00:35:43.000
Oh! Has understood everything
about sweets!

00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:48.667
Hey! Do you know that person?

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:53.292
He is the man who made
the sweet for Lady Canning!

00:35:53.292 --> 00:35:54.917
Bhim Nag?

00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:43.042
Rupo! Whom have you brought?

00:36:43.042 --> 00:36:45.375
He seems to be a young 'moira'!

00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:50.500
But Mahesh Moira said the new
sweets can only be made by him.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.250
Just give me one chance Madam...

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.417
I'll definitely be able to make it!

00:36:53.417 --> 00:36:55.833
Ok, let's see!

00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:58.125
Rupo! Leave this room now...

00:36:58.125 --> 00:36:59.125
Ok!

00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:00.667
I've some important things to
discuss with him!

00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:02.000
Ok!

00:37:03.708 --> 00:37:05.750
I can't turn my head repeatedly
to talk to you!

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.208
Come in front of me!

00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:09.542
Yes! … Yes Madam!

00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:16.708
I've three son-in-laws.

00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:19.375
You'll have to make sweet for them.

00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:21.167
Can you?

00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:24.500
Don't nod your head at the very outset.
Listen to me first!

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.542
All my son-in-laws are arrogant!

00:37:27.542 --> 00:37:29.792
The eldest is an addict.

00:37:29.792 --> 00:37:32.542
He wastes the whole day
away with his friends.

00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:33.750
Opium … hashish …

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.292
Doesn't pay heed to requests
by even his father-in-law.

00:37:36.292 --> 00:37:40.958
Today is occasion.
Even today he has brought those along.

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.875
The next one always hobnobs
with the Europeans.

00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:45.708
He has become almost a sahib.

00:37:45.708 --> 00:37:48.125
Our preparations do not suit his palate.

00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:51.500
Non-Hindu dishes are his most favourite.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.375
And the youngest spends the whole day
reading, writing and studying newspapers.

00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:59.292
Studying a few books he thinks
he's brought the world under his control.

00:37:59.292 --> 00:38:02.083
You'll have to outwit all of them.

00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:03.375
Can you do it?

00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:04.875
Outwit?

00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:06.458
Me?

00:38:08.042 --> 00:38:09.708
No Madam!

00:38:09.708 --> 00:38:12.708
Actually I couldn't continue my studies.

00:38:12.708 --> 00:38:14.917
My father died before I was born.

00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:15.917
And my mother alone …

00:38:15.917 --> 00:38:19.917
Ah! Did I ask you to engage in a
rhyming competition with them?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.125
You'll have to make a sweet that
will outwit them.

00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:28.875
Make such a sweetmeat
that even if they are amazed...

00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:30.875
cannot blame you.

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.750
Is it possible?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.667
It is...

00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:35.917
Your face doesn't indicate it'll happen.

00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:37.958
It will for sure.

00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:40.417
I'll tell you one thing.

00:38:40.417 --> 00:38:44.708
I wont give you more than
an anna for each sweet.

00:38:44.708 --> 00:38:48.125
Whatever price Kalibabu might
ask for them.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:58.250
Sugar...

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.958
posset...

00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:02.208
cream...

00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:05.083
...will they supply here?

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.000
No... no no!

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.333
Then go! Make it!

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.333
Nobin! Make some sweet …

00:39:22.333 --> 00:39:24.542
O my God!

00:39:24.542 --> 00:39:27.708
Haven't made a single
thing as yet! What are you thinking?

00:39:27.708 --> 00:39:29.333
Have to outwit them.

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.333
Outwit?

00:39:31.833 --> 00:39:34.708
Are you mad or what?

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:43.542
This palmyra kernel,
always drenches you!

00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:50.208
Hey! What has happened?

00:39:50.208 --> 00:39:51.583
Got it! Got it!
What?

00:39:51.583 --> 00:39:53.708
Got it! Got it! Got it!

00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:54.583
Listen!

00:39:55.708 --> 00:39:57.292
Bring me 50 mangoes.
Mango?

00:39:57.292 --> 00:39:58.875
As many as you can.
From wherever you can.

00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:00.375
Ripe mango, green mango,
hanging from the tree, dropped on the floor.

00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:01.417
Bring them all.

00:40:01.417 --> 00:40:02.292
And Keshar...

00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:06.958
Brother Chondu!

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.417
Do you see the same thing
that I see?

00:40:11.417 --> 00:40:12.583
Yes...!

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:16.542
I see...

00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:18.042
...a fruit in a sweetmeat.

00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:22.167
Me too.

00:40:22.167 --> 00:40:24.542
'Aam sandesh'...
(mango desert).

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.208
What a mishti I had at
Mr. Maxwell's place!

00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:38.042
From the very look of it,
it is quite evident that...

00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:40.042
this sweet has been prepared in
an unhygienic process.

00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:43.417
Not fit for consumption.

00:40:43.417 --> 00:40:47.875
An article by me on this was published
in Amrito uncle's magazine …

00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:51.750
Why do you preach
wisdom while eating?

00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:55.500
Listen my dear!
I'm giving you a clear warning!

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.458
If I find this sweet to be
of inferior quality,

00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:02.667
I'll hang you from the pole of charak...
with fire leaping up from below to catch you.

00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:05.875
You at least test one...

00:41:05.875 --> 00:41:08.833
If you find it unworthy,
punish me!

00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:44.042
Have it my dear! Have it!

00:41:56.958 --> 00:41:59.375
You've real talent, brother!

00:42:07.042 --> 00:42:08.750
How old are you?

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.583
What's your name?

00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:11.667
Twenty.

00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:12.917
My name is Nobin.

00:42:12.917 --> 00:42:17.333
N…o…b…I…n (young)!
You're still a teenager!

00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:20.542
Moustache has just started appearing!

00:42:20.542 --> 00:42:23.208
Such talent at this tender age!

00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:25.083
Amazing! Wonderful!

00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:26.250
Delicious!

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.417
You had almost started
a tumult in my palate!

00:42:31.083 --> 00:42:32.167
Absolutely!

00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:35.542
As if Malkanjaan has started
performing on my tongue!

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.000
I am not leaving you!

00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:42.250
Come... come!

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.667
Let me extend my good wishes to you!

00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:55.208
Leave him...

00:42:56.125 --> 00:42:57.708
One anna!

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.792
You mean to say this mishti
costs one anna?

00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:02.417
Will you force me to shut down
my shop?

00:43:02.417 --> 00:43:04.292
Do you do it intentionally?

00:43:04.292 --> 00:43:06.292
Or you are short of
practical understanding?

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.625
Or are you craving for claps
like the theatre artists?

00:43:08.625 --> 00:43:10.542
No!

00:43:10.542 --> 00:43:11.958
Actually Madam ordered me …

00:43:11.958 --> 00:43:15.167
and you jumped off with this...

00:43:15.167 --> 00:43:17.875
couldn't you say it's costlier to make?

00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:19.667
I … mmm …

00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:24.500
You talk so much
while arguing with elders...

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.417
Now have to answer.
Cannot keep mum!

00:43:29.417 --> 00:43:32.583
How will you pay back?
We'll not give a farthing!

00:43:32.583 --> 00:43:34.750
I apologize!

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.833
Might have misunderstood
what he was told.

00:43:37.833 --> 00:43:40.000
Pardon him for once!

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.167
Pardon me sister!

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:45.250
I took him only on
Reba's recommendation.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.208
I can't stand him any more!

00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.625
For his innovations my
age old shop will go to the docks?

00:43:49.625 --> 00:43:53.250
Now realize whom you've taken!

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.083
He was born with an ill omen.

00:43:55.083 --> 00:43:57.250
Finished his father
before he was born …

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.042
now he is out to finish you.

00:44:00.917 --> 00:44:02.250
Showing red eyes, eh?

00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:07.333
Will you be able to pay
back his money?

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:09.208
Do you have that capacity?

00:44:14.917 --> 00:44:16.875
Ma?

00:44:34.542 --> 00:44:35.875
Give it!

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:38.917
Take it!

00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:43.958
You've done a lot for me!

00:44:43.958 --> 00:44:45.792
Won't need any further help from you!

00:44:47.625 --> 00:44:48.958
Thanks!

00:44:51.292 --> 00:44:52.583
God bless!

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.458
Such arrogance!

00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:03.792
So you don't need any
help, isn't it?

00:45:03.792 --> 00:45:06.667
I give you seven days' time to leave
this house for good!

00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:07.625
Seven days!

00:45:09.083 --> 00:45:10.125
Ok!

00:45:18.542 --> 00:45:23.542
No! There's no scope here!
My workers are all experienced!

00:45:23.542 --> 00:45:28.125
My work is not possible with
young workers like you.

00:45:48.833 --> 00:45:51.458
What a pity!

00:45:51.458 --> 00:45:55.125
Collecting leaves from the wild
at this age!

00:45:55.125 --> 00:45:58.917
What else can you do with
a frenzied son like him?

00:45:58.917 --> 00:46:01.333
You can send him to our house.

00:46:01.333 --> 00:46:04.292
He will get some money
by weeding the garden.

00:46:04.292 --> 00:46:07.875
He has such a good physique.
Let him exercise it a little!

00:46:07.875 --> 00:46:09.292
My husband was saying...

00:46:09.292 --> 00:46:11.542
Nobin has started working as
a tabadi (night soil carrier).

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:14.208
Eh! My my! Fetid smell of shit!

00:46:15.917 --> 00:46:18.042
Come! Let's go!

00:46:19.958 --> 00:46:23.667
When he made sweets, did he do it
with hands soiled with shit?

00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:26.042
How do I know?
May be he did!

00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:59.167
What other things will you do
to disgrace me?

00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:02.083
Kill me! Just kill me!

00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:04.542
What can I do?

00:47:04.542 --> 00:47:08.375
Indrababu has slandered in
my name in such a way

00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:11.208
that no one is willing to appoint me.

00:47:12.583 --> 00:47:16.958
If I can't earn in these 7 days,
where shall we go ma?

00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:18.667
We'll live on the street,

00:47:18.667 --> 00:47:22.000
take shelter in Gosaipara's temple,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.250
if you wanted to become a sweet maker,
you'll become and nothing else.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:30.500
One who endures, he wins,
my son!

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:35.042
How much more do I have to
endure ma?

00:47:37.667 --> 00:47:40.208
How much more will I endure?

00:47:42.875 --> 00:47:45.917
At first I've to live...

00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:49.417
...then only can I become
a sweet maker!

00:47:50.042 --> 00:47:52.792
When the time is good,

00:47:52.792 --> 00:47:55.125
When the sun shines brightly,

00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:58.542
It's easy for anyone to be courageous!

00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:01.958
But when...

00:48:04.417 --> 00:48:06.500
clouds cover the sky,

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.625
When the thunder squall rages...

00:48:10.792 --> 00:48:14.083
then you need to have confidence!

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.250
Have confidence in yourself, my son!

00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:23.500
I've confidence in you!

00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:51.750
What's this gosain …
what has happened today …

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.417
Your hands are failing to catch the rhythm?

00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:56.583
My hands aren't catching
the rhythm...

00:48:56.583 --> 00:48:59.500
My mishtis aren't getting round …

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.667
… uh!

00:49:02.042 --> 00:49:04.333
None of you are listening to me!

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:41.875
Nobin!

00:49:45.917 --> 00:49:47.542
Oh Nobin!

00:49:47.917 --> 00:49:49.250
Hey … Nobin!

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.667
Feasting your eyes,
but what about the belly?

00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:01.375
But...

00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:03.000
...tell me where is work?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.625
Work? It's here.

00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:08.208
Will you be my partner?

00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:10.042
What...?

00:50:10.042 --> 00:50:13.833
No no.
It's partner.

00:50:15.083 --> 00:50:19.083
I've an empty shop in Jorashanko.

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.958
The magic of your hands...
and my money.

00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:24.083
Agreed?

00:50:24.083 --> 00:50:25.292
O yes!

00:50:25.292 --> 00:50:27.667
From now on, I'll also join you.

00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:30.125
What are you saying Maheshdada?

00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:31.833
Enough of copying!

00:50:31.833 --> 00:50:36.958
Then from today,
our partnership starts.

00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:40.250
Come! Let me give my good wishes!

00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:56.250
Bishnu! Who are these people?

00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:21.875
<i>Pitter patter rings the rain
on the watercolour painting...</i>

00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:28.208
<i>You're my only sky in
the shade of a pastoral tune.</i>

00:51:31.417 --> 00:51:38.083
<i>Multi coloured glass bangles,
faces of seven shades</i>

00:51:38.083 --> 00:51:46.917
<i>Your face veils the happiness
of the entire life.</i>

00:51:46.917 --> 00:51:54.250
<i>When shimul palash will be shed
on the way, and wind sway the heart...</i>

00:51:54.250 --> 00:52:00.417
<i>Then we two will live happily
keeping the oath alive in our hearts.</i>

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:20.208
<i>I'll sing the same tune
targeted at your eyes.</i>

00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:55.792
<i>How did it happen
what never happened before...</i>

00:52:55.792 --> 00:53:01.917
<i>As if the waves of a river
splash on my heart.</i>

00:53:15.167 --> 00:53:18.292
<i>My dear friend...</i>

00:53:21.708 --> 00:53:27.000
<i>My dear friend,
my life is in your hands!</i>

00:54:04.667 --> 00:54:08.625
What's the matter?
Why all this peeping and prying?

00:54:08.625 --> 00:54:13.708
No no! I just went there …
then came here …

00:54:13.708 --> 00:54:15.958
Don't feign innocence!

00:54:15.958 --> 00:54:17.292
I've seen everything!

00:54:17.292 --> 00:54:19.292
Following me for the last one year?

00:54:19.292 --> 00:54:22.250
Wherever I go,
you appear from nowhere.

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.167
Pursuing me at every step like a cat!

00:54:24.167 --> 00:54:26.917
What's your intention?

00:54:29.042 --> 00:54:31.875
I'll make the sweet...

00:54:32.292 --> 00:54:34.833
but where shall I find you?

00:54:36.042 --> 00:54:38.083
See this crumbling house,

00:54:38.083 --> 00:54:40.083
where I play hide and seek...

00:54:40.083 --> 00:54:42.875
and where you follow to
play hide and seek with me.

00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:45.333
Come here and call my name aloud

00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:49.125
You'll find me dropping in front of you.
Like the spirit of the sheora tree.

00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:58.167
If I do not find you...?

00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:03.250
You will.

00:55:03.958 --> 00:55:06.333
I'll get my moon-like sweet...

00:55:07.458 --> 00:55:10.208
And you'll get your Khirod!

00:55:14.583 --> 00:55:16.833
Will I get it?

00:55:19.542 --> 00:55:21.333
Will happen!

00:55:23.208 --> 00:55:25.167
It'll happen!

00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:30.458
Happen it will!
It will happen!

00:55:30.458 --> 00:55:32.583
Please do not worry!

00:55:32.583 --> 00:55:36.083
Your son's marriage is like
a function in our house!

00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:37.417
Leave all responsibilities to us!

00:56:00.083 --> 00:56:02.208
Nobinkishore!

00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:04.542
I'm going to pack my lungs …

00:56:04.542 --> 00:56:06.208
With fresh air!

00:56:09.917 --> 00:56:11.875
See!

00:56:11.875 --> 00:56:13.917
They're broken again!

00:56:13.917 --> 00:56:16.458
It is impossible Nobin!

00:56:24.208 --> 00:56:26.250
Good heavens! What's that?

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.500
That's nothing! Nothing!

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.917
Please continue.

00:56:29.917 --> 00:56:33.667
Bishtu!
Give the chewing tobacco!

00:56:33.667 --> 00:56:36.583
Don't regret afterwards!

00:56:36.583 --> 00:56:38.917
Your daughter is nearing sixteen.

00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:41.167
You'll not be able to arrange
her marriage after this!

00:56:42.958 --> 00:56:45.875
No ma! I'll not marry!

00:56:45.875 --> 00:56:49.250
Given my word!
Have to make a thing.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:51.750
I've not asked you anything!

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.875
You've to follow my order and marry!

00:56:54.875 --> 00:56:58.708
Very wisely I and Khentidi have
decided this for you!

00:56:58.708 --> 00:57:02.125
They don't interfere in others' affairs.

00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:09.417
Listen! Your wayward daughter
cannot adjust with others.

00:57:09.417 --> 00:57:12.083
Here there's only the husband
and the mother-in-law!

00:57:14.833 --> 00:57:16.708
It's nothing! It's nothing!

00:57:16.708 --> 00:57:19.542
Have rented a house in Chitpur!

00:57:19.542 --> 00:57:21.042
You've a liking for music!

00:57:21.042 --> 00:57:23.833
For over seven generations,
they've been steeped in music.

00:57:23.833 --> 00:57:28.792
Has opened a shop all by himself.
Gradually, he'll organize everything!

00:57:28.792 --> 00:57:32.292
Moreover, both your family
and theirs are 'moiras'!

00:57:32.292 --> 00:57:33.042
Khentididi!

00:57:33.042 --> 00:57:34.833
What's the name of the boy?

00:57:34.833 --> 00:57:36.292
Nobin Chandra...

00:57:36.292 --> 00:57:37.875
...Das!

00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:39.500
What?

00:57:41.917 --> 00:57:43.292
Do you know?

00:57:43.292 --> 00:57:45.458
She's the granddaughter of Bhola Moira!

00:57:56.833 --> 00:58:01.042
<i>The divine couple have
met each other...</i>

00:58:01.042 --> 00:58:05.708
<i>Behold!
Rai stands on the left of Shyam.</i>

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:23.667
<i>When Rai had Kanu,
happiness flooded her...</i>

00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:35.625
<i>Behold!
Rai stands on the left of Shyam.</i>

00:58:52.792 --> 00:58:55.167
Oh! Ho! It's you?

00:58:58.833 --> 00:59:00.458
Hey stop! Stand there!

00:59:02.333 --> 00:59:04.208
Hey you've become very naughty!

00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:06.708
To bring you here
has been my greatest mistake!

00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:08.708
Come on! Go out!

00:59:08.708 --> 00:59:11.083
Don't pester me any more!
I'm married now?

00:59:11.083 --> 00:59:12.667
Go!

00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:23.375
Oh!

00:59:23.375 --> 00:59:25.625
Please bring me the sugar!

00:59:25.625 --> 00:59:27.333
Give it to me!

00:59:31.792 --> 00:59:33.625
Open the lid!

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.833
Work and then you'll know the hassle.

00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:00.667
I'll work also?

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.458
Why not?

01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:05.583
I'm sweet maker...
and you're my wife!

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:34.833
Alack!

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:37.000
What do I see here? Eh!

01:00:37.917 --> 01:00:40.167
Son! Son!

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:44.583
Round balls! R..round!

01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:47.333
Last night also you made those balls!

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:50.833
Lay here the whole night with her?

01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:52.625
You made her work through
the night, isn't it?

01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:54.333
Ma, tell her who didn't sleep
in the proper place.

01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:56.042
I don't need a separate resting place.

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:57.792
No mother!

01:00:57.792 --> 01:00:59.042
I had no problem.

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:01.333
You don't poke your nose into this!

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:03.458
Don't pamper him any more!

01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:05.208
My pampering has turned him
into a monkey!

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:06.875
Son! Listen carefully!

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.875
When you've married, you'll
have to take all responsibilities!

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.167
I didn't want to marry …

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.083
What?

01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:14.833
My first priority is my sweet,
then comes the rest.

01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:18.417
Used to follow me everywhere,
and now he says he didn't want to marry!

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:19.708
Liar!

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:22.000
Son...

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.792
you followed her?

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:24.958
No ma!

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:27.208
What no? For whom are you
making this sweet, eh?

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:28.583
You are making it for her?

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:30.000
No ma!

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.208
That sweet will never happen!

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:33.333
Can't make sweet … he can
only make fool of others!

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.000
Only tall talks!

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.083
I know how far you can go!

01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:40.667
Need not make syrupy ball,
rather try to make horse eggs!

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:42.250
Is that it?

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.583
All right!

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:46.083
Unless I make that mishti,
I'll not enter the house…

01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:49.333
not even step on your shadow.
Wicked girl … telling all lies!

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.250
What can I say Master...

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:57.083
if I had known about
the whereabouts of the owner …

01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:59.458
Who is Chondu?
I'm the owner!

01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:03.292
You'll be mistaken if you think
you'll get away with such lame excuses …

01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:05.833
I'll throw you all in jail …
I'll take back my shop …

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:08.042
Then I'll see which Gauri Sen
comes to save you!

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:10.000
Chondu...

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:14.708
Listen! I'm giving you seven days' time!

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:19.542
If I do not get the arrear rent within
that time, then see what I can do!

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:22.625
Do you know sir, in good faith
I had given this shop on rent

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:26.208
Spent one and a half years
without paying rent.

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:28.625
So you're great swindlers!

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:32.083
It has been a month since
I made the advance …

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:34.000
Where's the new mishti?
Where is it?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.250
By chance I came to see
a day before the function …

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.750
That advance was also
taken by Chondu babu!

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.667
Hell with your Chondu babu!

01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:44.167
This is the mishti for my son's marriage!

01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:47.250
My son will not marry ten times!

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.750
Tomorrow if the mishti doesn't reach on time,

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:55.333
I'll hire goons
to destroy your shop.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:58.792
Catch them!
Put them under pressure!

01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:28.000
<i>Oh beloved... don't tease me
in this tender age!</i>

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.792
<i>Please leave my hand
and let me go!</i>

01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:11.458
<i>O dear! Nobody is aware of
his intension...</i>

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:20.750
<i>How can one be lost
in this direction?</i>

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:31.125
<i>Beauty is not to be maligned
in public observance.</i>

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:41.125
<i>Behold her beauty to admire her
from a distance.</i>

01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:47.542
<i>Please listen to
me, my beloved...</i>

01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:59.208
<i>Don't tease her in this tender age.</i>

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:37.625
Great! What a performance!

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.833
What a surprise!

01:05:46.833 --> 01:05:51.042
'Aam sandesh' sir!
What makes you come here?

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:56.792
You! You too!

01:05:58.833 --> 01:06:01.250
Come on! Get up!

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.250
No!

01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:06.333
Why are you pulling me?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.333
Slowly! Careful!

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.250
Leave this joint and come home!

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.875
Leave me!

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:14.958
Already taken the advance
for making the new sweet!

01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.750
How do I do it?
Where's the money?

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:20.958
Money is opium, opium money!

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.375
The shop-owner had come … said...

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:28.042
if we can't pay the rent within
7 days, he'll close down the shop.

01:06:28.042 --> 01:06:29.167
Let him close down!

01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:31.458
What do you mean? What shall
we do without the shop?

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:34.708
Only if we can make that new mishti,
the shop will get saved

01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:37.667
… you'll be saved … I'll be saved!

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:39.083
Try to understand!

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:43.042
How many more people
do you like to ruin?

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:47.458
He is Nobin Kishore.

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:50.375
Makes very good mishti.

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:54.042
And you, for your addictions,
make fool of others!

01:06:57.208 --> 01:06:58.500
How much is required?

01:07:03.125 --> 01:07:04.792
Tell me, how much is required?

01:07:04.792 --> 01:07:06.958
No … I …

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:11.375
Two rupees.

01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:18.208
I beg your pardon for the break
in the performance.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.875
That's all right!

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:24.417
Your Malkanjaan will be back
very soon.

01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:32.792
Why will you give?

01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:38.167
Take it as my wish or my choice …

01:07:38.167 --> 01:07:41.417
Many homes have got devastated for me...

01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:47.583
Today, if not home,
let someone's shop be established!

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:49.917
You …

01:07:49.917 --> 01:07:51.667
Don't make me talk too much!

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:55.000
My voice is very precious!

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.083
Take this!

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:02.167
I say... take this!

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:07.042
Whenever I get an opportunity,
I'll return your money, my sister!

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:16.917
Go!

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:25.125
Leave me please!
Come with me silently!

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:26.833
My head is spinning!
Don't pull me like that.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.083
Hey! What are you doing?

01:08:37.083 --> 01:08:39.083
Go at a distance! Go!

01:08:39.083 --> 01:08:40.583
See what's happening here!

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:43.333
Is it possible to stand
here in smoke and dust?

01:08:43.333 --> 01:08:47.250
You've taken money...
do you remember?

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.167
Now take the responsibility...
Zamindari?

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:56.375
Talk softly. Go and get some saffron,
pistachio, currant … and some mango leather.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:58.375
This is our last attempt.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:01.250
How do stay in this smoke and dust?

01:09:02.333 --> 01:09:04.042
Tell me.

01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:07.083
I'm Amritalal Banik.

01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:09.542
My name is Mahesh. So what?

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:12.167
Sweet! But I want to
talk to Nobinbabu!

01:09:12.167 --> 01:09:13.792
Say that!

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:17.917
Nobin! See who has
come to talk with you!

01:09:17.917 --> 01:09:19.917
Coming!

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.583
Take! Hold it!

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:26.125
Me? What a problem!

01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:29.208
Welcome!

01:09:29.208 --> 01:09:30.250
Why are you standing here?

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.750
Please go quickly!
It's getting late!

01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:01.417
The new mishti that you're preparing …

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:05.542
It's being made… it'll happen…
don't worry… I'll send it …

01:10:05.542 --> 01:10:07.542
No, no I'm not asking you to send it …

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:10.000
I'm talking of the right that
you have on the new mishti …

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.958
Rights and mights may
be discussed later …

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.833
If I'm late everything
will go to the dogs …

01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:16.958
Later I'll let you have
whatever I make...

01:10:18.625 --> 01:10:19.792
Sweet!

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:24.792
What?

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.292
Please have it!

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:02.875
Take one more!

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.417
New sweet!

01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:39.500
Have come here to kill people?

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.250
See what you've done!

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:45.417
Beat him! Punch him!

01:11:54.542 --> 01:11:56.125
Beat both of them!

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:30.333
Maheshdada!

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:33.208
I'll not make sweet any more!

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Never!

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:52.708
Hey! Please listen to my words!

01:12:53.917 --> 01:12:56.125
Oh Nobin!

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.958
Look maa ji,
how many days have passed …

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:05.250
he's kept himself confined in his room.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:08.250
Why don't you convince him a little?

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.542
How much more should I say?

01:13:09.542 --> 01:13:12.208
Does he ever listen to anybody?

01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:14.750
Hey child, why don't you
say something to him?

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:17.542
What will she say?

01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:21.333
The boy who loves to work
is not even stepping out...

01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:23.750
...does she really care?

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:26.542
In our times, if the husband's
body was warm,

01:13:26.542 --> 01:13:28.458
it caused blisters on the wife's body.

01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:31.000
Now-a-days they don't even care a fig.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.125
What kind of
daughter-in-law have I brought!

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:34.750
Oh! She's just a little girl …!

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:35.917
Little girl?

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:40.500
I was married at nine.
At her age Nobin was already born.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.458
Little? Huh!

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:45.583
All the time she
speaks a lot...

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:49.000
If I knew this,
I would not bring her home!

01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:53.333
Aha! No! No!

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:55.875
Look!

01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:05.625
Eh Nobin!

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:11.500
What kind of a husband are you?

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.333
Get up please!

01:14:17.542 --> 01:14:20.250
In our times,
if the wife's body was warm,

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:23.125
it caused blisters on
the husband's body.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.750
I just can't fathom
the behaviour of you two!

01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:42.958
Khirod!

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.292
Oh Khirod!

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:01.458
Khirod!

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:03.458
What are you doing here?

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:05.542
Why have you come here?

01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:08.000
In search of you Khirod!

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.708
I've also come in search of someone.

01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:12.792
You...?

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.167
Whom...?

01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:16.958
Don't you remember,
there was a boy...

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:20.458
who played khol with
the performers in our house …

01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:24.958
and when I played who
looked at me surreptitiously …

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:27.917
who spent nights preparing sweet …

01:15:27.917 --> 01:15:30.333
the one who had given me his word...

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:36.250
that he would make a soft,
round sweet like the moon …

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:39.333
who never accepted defeat …

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:42.250
I'm trying to find that boy …

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.042
that boy!

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:49.250
That boy can't be found
any more Khirod!

01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:59.583
If he can't be found,
I also cannot be found any more!

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.708
I'm defeated Khirod! …

01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:13.667
I'm defeated!

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:47.000
For whom were you making
the sweet?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.542
It's for me … for you …

01:16:50.542 --> 01:16:54.958
Then why do you care about others?

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:09.833
<i>You also will find the way...
Whatever a thousand people may say.</i>

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:15.708
<i>Your hands will light the lamp...
Of my cosy little home.</i>

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:20.708
<i>Let people think whatever they want to...
Let thousand rumors blow in the wind.</i>

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:25.625
<i>You will always find at your side...
Your Khirod and the syrupy ball!</i>

01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:32.250
I'll not be defeated Khirod..

01:17:33.833 --> 01:17:36.667
Neither will I see you getting defeated!

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.125
I know.

01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:04.917
Hi Nobin!
What are doing now?

01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:06.208
Doing nothing, but will do.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:11.667
You only say – will do,
will happen …

01:18:11.667 --> 01:18:14.833
Just opposite your shop,
I'm opening my sweetmeat shop.

01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:34.375
Hey Kanha!

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:36.500
Showing haughtiness, eh?

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.625
Hey Bihari!

01:18:39.292 --> 01:18:43.083
Go! Fling him to the ground!

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:45.333
That's ok. Go!

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.917
Dada! Bihari can't do it!

01:18:49.917 --> 01:18:52.083
Let's see what happens!

01:18:54.292 --> 01:18:55.958
Brajababu!

01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:58.375
Not babu, call me wrestler …

01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:01.208
… Braja wrestler!

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.250
So...

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.458
You've come to fight with Kanha?

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:10.292
Oh no! No!

01:19:10.292 --> 01:19:12.458
I've come for rent.

01:19:13.417 --> 01:19:15.625
Do you consider me to be
a hired goon...

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:17.792
or a spoiler?

01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:21.458
Goons and spoiler are available
on hire, not wrestlers.

01:19:21.458 --> 01:19:24.458
No no! I want to
take your shop on rent.

01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:26.417
Shop...

01:19:26.417 --> 01:19:33.375
In Bagbazar, you've a shop opposite
Kalidas Indra's …I've come to take that on rent.

01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:36.417
Your brother's adjascnt house…

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:37.833
Yes yes!

01:19:37.833 --> 01:19:39.125
We stay there on rent.

01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:42.083
Hey fling him!
Fling him to the ground!

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.958
What will you sell from that shop?

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.208
Sweet!

01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:56.000
Your sweet shop
opposite Kalidas Indra's shop?

01:20:03.083 --> 01:20:05.833
Better do one thing!

01:20:05.833 --> 01:20:08.208
Go! Fight one round with Kanha!

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.583
Go!

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:19.125
My wrestling is as bad as
Kanha's making sweets...

01:20:19.125 --> 01:20:23.208
I cannot wrestle,
can only make sweet.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:26.292
Well! Very well said!

01:20:28.417 --> 01:20:30.708
Did you hear what he said?
Yes, sir!

01:20:30.708 --> 01:20:32.958
Listen my dear!

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:36.958
As a mark of obeisance and two
months' advance rent, give seven rupees.

01:20:36.958 --> 01:20:39.292
Seven rupees! So much?

01:20:39.292 --> 01:20:43.417
Many are waiting to take that shop
at a higher price than that.

01:20:43.417 --> 01:20:46.208
If you can, give … otherwise go!
No, no I will!

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:49.333
But for that,
I need at least ten days!

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:53.708
Braja wrestler!

01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:57.042
I'm badly in need of that shop.

01:20:57.042 --> 01:21:00.792
Please do not give it
to anyone before ten days!

01:21:00.792 --> 01:21:04.292
If you need it so badly,
then seven days!

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:07.042
If you can bring the money within
seven days, the shop is yours.

01:21:07.042 --> 01:21:08.292
If not, forget it!

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:17.292
Want money? …

01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:20.042
But my dear...

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:23.042
I don't give money to children!

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.708
Good bye, my boy!

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:35.792
See! Shop is good!

01:21:35.792 --> 01:21:37.625
Money? I'll give.

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:40.167
Have to keep something in mortgage.

01:21:40.167 --> 01:21:42.083
What did you say?
Mortgage?

01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:45.125
Yes! Property deed … ornaments …

01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:47.375
have to give something, isn't it?

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:50.417
Not much! Only ten rupees!

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:52.625
Ten rupees!

01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:54.042
Oh yes.

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:58.417
If no one gives me a chance,
what do I do?

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:03.333
Do I get money from the tree?

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:05.875
Huh! Says – he will not
give money to kids!

01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:07.042
Am I kid?

01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:10.292
Let the old people sit in their shops!
Nothing new will be made!

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:13.625
Khirod, someone has to
help, isn't it?

01:22:13.625 --> 01:22:16.958
Doesn't everyone have a 'first day'?

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:20.167
How do I … the shop …

01:22:25.333 --> 01:22:27.750
What? What's this?

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.792
Your shop...

01:22:30.792 --> 01:22:33.000
Ornaments?
Yes.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.667
Have you gone mad Khirod?

01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:39.042
Ultimately your ornaments?
Fie on me!

01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:46.750
Who said these are my ornaments?

01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:48.667
These are all gold and silver garbage!

01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:51.042
But you!

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:54.250
Have you ever seen me
wearing all these?

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:57.958
Here is my ornament!

01:22:57.958 --> 01:22:59.500
But …

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.750
No ifs and buts …
You establish your shop.

01:23:05.417 --> 01:23:07.875
Will you not give my
things back even today?

01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:10.208
Have you returned the entire money?

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:13.125
Paid your interest?
No! Then go!

01:23:17.583 --> 01:23:19.917
Come my dear! Come!

01:23:21.917 --> 01:23:24.375
Money … money … money …

01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:33.583
Get out! Out from here!

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:36.167
What do you think of me?
An usurer?

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:38.167
Or have I started a
money-lending business?

01:23:38.167 --> 01:23:39.708
Brought the ornaments of
your newly wed wife?

01:23:39.708 --> 01:23:40.792
Mam … I …

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:43.292
I had told you on the first day – Nobin,
I'm there for you.

01:23:43.292 --> 01:23:45.167
Did I tell you to bring the ornaments
of your new wife?

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:47.000
Pick it up! Pick up! Quick!

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.708
Huh! Stripped the new wife
of all her ornaments!

01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:52.542
Fie on you! Such a sin!

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:58.542
I had gone to a Parsee usurer.
But from his attitude, I could understand

01:23:58.542 --> 01:24:00.833
I would never be able to get
the ornaments back.

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:03.625
That's why I came to you.

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.167
Why did you go to such an usurer?

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:08.625
You should have come to me first.

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:11.250
Setting up a sweetmeat shop, isn't it?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.958
Will this gold coin do?

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:19.750
I don't need this much of money.

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.708
Keep it.

01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:24.375
Opening a new shop …
furnish it properly!

01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:27.708
It needs time to get profit!

01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:30.167
Madam!

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.500
But...

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.042
I'll return your money!

01:24:36.042 --> 01:24:38.750
I know Nabin!
I've advanced in age!

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.250
I know people.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:44.125
If it does good to you,
you'll do good to many more people.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:49.500
Ok! Ok!

01:24:53.875 --> 01:24:56.125
Don't ever bend your
head down to any one!

01:25:03.458 --> 01:25:07.125
See, Bihari could do …
can you do it too?

01:25:08.833 --> 01:25:10.750
It will happen...

01:25:14.167 --> 01:25:16.500
<i>Impossible will be possible...</i>

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.125
<i>What will be will be!</i>

01:25:19.125 --> 01:25:24.500
<i>Shadows of dark cloud
have been removed...</i>

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:34.750
<i>With your sweet smile
people are following your path!</i>

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:40.833
<i>You are that crazy wind
that encourages the wings to fly...</i>

01:25:40.833 --> 01:25:45.958
<i>All new thoughts are on soar!</i>

01:25:45.958 --> 01:25:51.292
<i>You are that direction
which leads new dreams!</i>

01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:57.083
<i>Everything is painted new with colors!</i>

01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:11.250
<i>After a year...</i>

01:26:22.583 --> 01:26:25.208
Why is the counter empty?

01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:26.917
Then who will make the sweets?

01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:29.917
From morning till night
the same thing …

01:26:29.917 --> 01:26:31.833
making the same white balls …

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:33.708
this father-in-law of mine
is not making sweets …

01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:35.667
he's after making the Taj Mahal!

01:26:35.667 --> 01:26:38.417
Since two years it's being made …
and being made …

01:26:38.417 --> 01:26:40.375
Don't talk about a thing which
you don't understand!

01:26:40.375 --> 01:26:44.250
Yes! He understands everything!

01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:46.750
Our own Ram Raja Mohan Roy!

01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:47.792
What did you say?

01:26:47.792 --> 01:26:50.542
"Ram Raja Mohan Roy"?

01:26:50.542 --> 01:26:52.333
Raja Rammohan Roy.

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.750
How many more days
shall pass like this?

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:57.458
Make your new mishti,
But you'll also have to make the other sweets.

01:26:57.458 --> 01:27:00.458
Otherwise where will
the money come from?

01:27:01.208 --> 01:27:02.750
See!

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.000
This is the problem of women!

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.333
Now you say – make mishti and
then you say – make money!

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:09.750
You yourself don't know what you want.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:11.417
Don't talk about that sweet!

01:27:11.417 --> 01:27:14.708
It's almost two years now and
we're yet to see it!

01:27:14.708 --> 01:27:16.875
You are ruinning both
your home and work!

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:19.125
Your ability is well known to me!

01:27:19.125 --> 01:27:21.958
Then I … I …
what am I doing now?

01:27:21.958 --> 01:27:23.708
Who am I doing it for?

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:26.042
What are you looking at?

01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:38.833
Call my son.

01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:40.917
It's already late.
Won't you have lunch today?

01:27:40.917 --> 01:27:43.458
If it continues like this ma,
we'll have to starve.

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:46.208
Why? What again?

01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:50.833
Ma, I've decided to sit on the other side
of the door to manage the shop.

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:54.417
I'll talk with the milkman and
other suppliers.

01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:56.917
A housewife will look after a shop?

01:27:58.125 --> 01:28:00.500
Otherwise the shop will
go to the dogs!

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.542
The amount of loan that
we've incurred by now …

01:28:02.542 --> 01:28:06.458
If we fail to steer it properly
we will lose everything.

01:28:06.458 --> 01:28:10.208
Look my dear! I've allowed many
untoward behaviour of Nobin,

01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:12.042
but I'll not tolerate this!

01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:12.958
What'll people think?

01:28:12.958 --> 01:28:17.250
If you think about people's
thoughts, what'll people think?

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:21.042
People will criticize even
you do something or not!

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:24.167
That, of course, is right.

01:28:25.292 --> 01:28:29.000
Nobin's dad, you know,
was also like this.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.167
I couldn't bend him...

01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:35.167
Try if you can.

01:28:36.125 --> 01:28:37.375
Take it!

01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:41.292
Come on! Take it!

01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:46.667
That's all right!

01:28:49.208 --> 01:28:51.042
Sometimes I charge an anna per seer …

01:28:51.042 --> 01:28:52.458
Sometimes two annas …

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:54.417
And from some I charge even four annas.

01:28:54.417 --> 01:28:57.792
It's my milk, I'll decide what
price will I charge to whom.

01:28:57.792 --> 01:29:00.667
If you want, take it.
Otherwise you milk the cows!

01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:03.417
You cannot increase the price
every now and then!

01:29:03.417 --> 01:29:06.375
With the cost of milk,
the price of sweets are also got to be higher.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:11.833
The condition of your shop suggests,
you cannot sale this way or that way.

01:29:11.833 --> 01:29:16.667
And listen!
I don't talk business with women!

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:19.833
Tomorrow, will you
take milk at this price?

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:21.042
Ok. Send it.

01:29:21.042 --> 01:29:22.833
All right.

01:29:30.458 --> 01:29:33.708
See, there's no one in the shop.

01:29:33.708 --> 01:29:34.625
Let's go!

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:37.292
Please wait sir! Please!

01:29:38.292 --> 01:29:40.292
What do you like to have?

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.125
What do I see, Natabar?

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:45.667
Maheshdada, customer has come.

01:29:45.667 --> 01:29:49.167
I want the mishti of Lady Canning
and some babu sandesh.

01:29:49.167 --> 01:29:51.333
Is it there?

01:29:52.375 --> 01:29:56.375
We don't have that, but we've
very good sandesh and chhanaporha.

01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:58.833
'Dedo'? 'Porha' (burnt)?

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:01.917
In such shops you'll get only
stuff like dedo, porha

01:30:01.917 --> 01:30:03.667
… nothing else.

01:30:03.667 --> 01:30:06.333
Don't you realize why there's
no customer in the shop?

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:08.500
Come, let's go to that shop.
Let's go.

01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:17.750
What?

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.500
To hell with you!

01:30:26.417 --> 01:30:28.167
Hey! Nobin!

01:30:39.875 --> 01:30:44.250
Master, may I tell you something?

01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:45.833
Tell me.

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:48.542
Don't take Nobin so seriously.

01:30:48.542 --> 01:30:52.792
The condition of his shop suggests,
it'll go to the dogs any day.

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:58.000
It is wise to extract the poison fang
of a snake, while it's still a baby.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.792
Poison grows without telling
the snake or the charmer!

01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:10.917
One who can make a new mishti
in an hour's time, is an ordinary boy?

01:31:10.917 --> 01:31:13.708
Only if I could taste that
mango desert he made …

01:31:13.708 --> 01:31:16.208
He has made nothing new…

01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:19.833
Since the last two years,
he's been making only balls …

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:23.625
One who doesn't think about time...

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:26.917
will have to be taken seriously!

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:41.833
Where to?

01:31:42.667 --> 01:31:46.542
At Paolo sahib's house in Bandel.

01:31:46.542 --> 01:31:49.458
Has arranged a musical party in the
morning, he has invited us there.

01:31:51.667 --> 01:31:52.792
Will you take me with you?

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:57.417
Boatman, please row
the boat to the shore!

01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:36.000
<i>As dark as the black bumblebee
my friend, when will you come...</i>

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.250
<i>tell me, oh tell me!</i>

01:33:28.292 --> 01:33:32.958
<i>If you want to go, my friend...</i>

01:33:32.958 --> 01:33:40.083
<i>Leave back the towel on your shoulder.</i>

01:33:55.250 --> 01:34:06.500
<i>As dark as the black bumblebee
my friend, when will you come...</i>

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:13.708
<i>tell me, oh tell me!</i>

01:34:35.042 --> 01:34:44.500
<i>The cool shade of the banyan tree...</i>

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:51.542
<i>Just like that is the affection of my friend.</i>

01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:22.542
<i>As dark as the black bumblebee
my friend, when will you come...</i>

01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:27.542
<i>tell me, oh tell me!</i>

01:36:03.667 --> 01:36:05.375
Wonderful!

01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:12.958
Where is your house?
What's your name?

01:36:12.958 --> 01:36:15.375
I live in Bagbazar.

01:36:15.375 --> 01:36:17.375
My name is Nobin Chandra Das.

01:36:17.375 --> 01:36:19.500
Basically, I'm sweet maker by
profession… singer by passion.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.917
That means there's a common
thing between us …

01:36:21.917 --> 01:36:23.167
'Kaman'(Cannon)?

01:36:23.167 --> 01:36:25.750
Hey! Why 'kaman'?

01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:27.583
What did I do sahib?

01:36:27.583 --> 01:36:31.667
Common means you love
cooking, I love cooking …

01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:34.083
you love music … I love music …

01:36:34.083 --> 01:36:36.250
that's what we call 'common'!

01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:40.000
Don't get scared!
He's praising you!

01:36:41.292 --> 01:36:43.167
William! Bring some cake!

01:36:44.667 --> 01:36:46.625
Cake made of 'hing' (asafetida)?

01:36:49.458 --> 01:36:51.250
Is he William?

01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:53.458
Horro … William Horro.

01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:00.000
Have you tasted it before?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.750
No! Seen it in
sahib para (European locality).

01:37:03.875 --> 01:37:06.792
Tell me what's there!
Wow! I can't miss it.

01:37:06.792 --> 01:37:08.875
This is posset!
Correct posset…

01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:11.958
We call it cottage cheese.

01:37:15.917 --> 01:37:17.417
But...

01:37:17.417 --> 01:37:20.625
how come the posset is so smooth?
Your posset is a bit rough …

01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:23.875
Ours is smooth... smooth!

01:37:23.875 --> 01:37:26.375
Your posset is rough …
Sahib's posset is smooth.

01:37:29.042 --> 01:37:31.167
I've a request Sahib!

01:37:31.167 --> 01:37:32.667
Tell me.

01:37:32.667 --> 01:37:37.333
Will you please take me to your kitchen …

01:37:37.333 --> 01:37:41.542
I mean where you prepare your posset …
where you knead it …will you show me?

01:37:41.542 --> 01:37:42.458
Sure.

01:37:42.458 --> 01:37:43.208
Will you?

01:37:43.208 --> 01:37:44.500
Sure. I will.

01:37:45.917 --> 01:37:47.750
But …

01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:50.292
you'll sing one more song …

01:37:59.208 --> 01:38:00.417
Wow!

01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:02.083
Look!

01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:03.583
This is where you make
your sweetmeat?

01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:07.500
Oh! It's lemon!

01:38:07.875 --> 01:38:09.833
We also …

01:38:09.833 --> 01:38:12.000
Be patient!

01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:26.208
So it's water of chhana!

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:34.250
If whey is mixed with milk,

01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:37.958
then only the posset will be smooth.
Oh! Then that's the key?

01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:40.000
Sahib!

01:38:40.833 --> 01:38:45.167
This whey will make
my syrupy ball.

01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:48.833
'Rosogolla'? No, it's
the syrupy ball...

01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:51.417
'Rosogolla' – what's that?

01:38:51.417 --> 01:38:53.917
Sahib…

01:38:58.958 --> 01:39:01.625
that's my life Sahib…

01:39:03.542 --> 01:39:05.458
...that's my love!

01:39:05.458 --> 01:39:08.292
Love?

01:39:08.292 --> 01:39:10.542
Remember, my young friend,

01:39:10.542 --> 01:39:13.333
love is all about keeping promises.

01:39:20.917 --> 01:39:22.875
Rosogolla…

01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:25.417
Will happen!

01:39:32.375 --> 01:39:34.042
Son?

01:39:36.958 --> 01:39:38.792
Where had you been son?

01:39:38.792 --> 01:39:41.167
Tell me, why do you
do like this?

01:39:41.167 --> 01:39:42.458
Don't you feel our concern?

01:39:42.458 --> 01:39:44.875
Giving you my word,
I'll not do this any more...

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:46.083
Come! Come!

01:39:49.125 --> 01:39:50.875
Go!

01:39:52.292 --> 01:39:53.958
Khirod!

01:39:53.958 --> 01:39:56.958
Our new mishti will be made!

01:39:56.958 --> 01:40:00.875
You know, I'm coming from
so far a place called Bandel!

01:40:00.875 --> 01:40:04.750
There that Paolo sahib
was calling our syrupy ball...

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:07.125
'Rosogolla' … 'Rosogolla' …

01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:09.000
Nice name … isn't it?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.292
Hey… where are you going?
Where?

01:40:12.625 --> 01:40:15.042
You will do whatever you like on
the plea of making that new mishti...

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:17.000
and we'll have to accept that?

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.833
No more plea …
this time it'll happen.

01:40:18.833 --> 01:40:20.375
Rosogolla!

01:40:20.375 --> 01:40:22.792
Sweet, sweet, sweet … is your head
filled only with sweet?

01:40:22.792 --> 01:40:24.417
Yes...!

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:36.542
And you are in my mind!

01:40:36.542 --> 01:40:39.083
I know you'll make me cry again.

01:40:39.083 --> 01:40:41.292
I'll not make you cry any more.

01:40:41.292 --> 01:40:43.833
I give you my word. By god …

01:40:44.833 --> 01:40:47.458
This time our Rosogolla
will be made definitely!

01:41:26.833 --> 01:41:28.833
Maheshdada!

01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:42.333
Ho! Done! It's done!

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:07.542
Where are we going, my dear?

01:42:08.292 --> 01:42:09.750
You've forgotten?

01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:24.625
Take it!

01:42:26.958 --> 01:42:28.833
Your sweet... as white as moon!

01:42:28.833 --> 01:42:32.458
I feed you everyday …

01:42:33.458 --> 01:42:35.583
Today you feed me!

01:42:36.458 --> 01:42:37.292
Me!

01:45:13.083 --> 01:45:16.792
Do you know…
here a bridge will be made…

01:45:16.792 --> 01:45:20.042
Howrah station is on the other side …
People will reach there much faster.

01:45:20.042 --> 01:45:24.083
That's good,
but nothing is being done …

01:45:24.083 --> 01:45:27.167
only beating the drum beforehand!

01:45:27.167 --> 01:45:29.042
Beating the drum is also necessary!

01:45:29.042 --> 01:45:34.167
Making a good thing is not enough... you'll
also have to let people know about it!

01:45:34.167 --> 01:45:38.167
We'll have to let people know
about your new sweet!

01:45:38.167 --> 01:45:40.875
From now on
whoever comes to your shop...

01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:44.500
give him your Rosogolla
to taste … for free!

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.792
They will bring you new customers!

01:45:46.792 --> 01:45:48.292
You know me very well.

01:45:48.292 --> 01:45:51.292
I love to feed people.

01:45:51.292 --> 01:45:57.250
But I don't like matters relating
to money!

01:45:59.792 --> 01:46:03.167
When will you grow up my dear?
Leave it!

01:46:03.167 --> 01:46:05.583
What's the use in growing up!

01:46:05.583 --> 01:46:08.208
You're there … isn't it?

01:46:08.208 --> 01:46:12.125
Shameless!
Everyone is watching!

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:20.167
Hallo, Hemen bhaia!
Is Kalibabu there?

01:46:20.167 --> 01:46:21.042
Yes!

01:46:22.208 --> 01:46:23.750
Hemen!

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:26.833
Go inside! The idiot
can't trace a single thing!

01:46:26.833 --> 01:46:29.458
A rascal has come to work
in my shop …

01:46:31.458 --> 01:46:33.417
Ram Ram Kalibabu!

01:46:33.417 --> 01:46:37.875
This is Nobin's Rosogolla... the
new sweet … it's very good!

01:46:45.125 --> 01:46:48.500
Seems the sales from your shop
is not very encouraging?

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:51.667
You have to push things to people!

01:46:51.667 --> 01:46:54.792
No no! Our products are moving …

01:46:54.792 --> 01:46:58.875
Daughter in law said – Go!
Let everyone taste our new sweet!

01:46:58.875 --> 01:47:03.792
What's there in this Rosogolla?
It's just another sweet!

01:47:07.625 --> 01:47:10.000
It has...

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.542
the essence of love...

01:47:13.125 --> 01:47:15.833
the labour of sleepless night...

01:47:16.708 --> 01:47:19.750
the peace of soul…

01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:22.083
And the most important of all…

01:47:23.125 --> 01:47:25.417
It has the answer to all the fight!

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.250
Go away!

01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:42.375
Even flies are not coming!

01:47:42.375 --> 01:47:46.208
Papa! Feeling very thirsty papa!

01:47:47.875 --> 01:47:50.708
All the time you feel
something or the other…

01:47:50.708 --> 01:47:54.583
Sometimes you feel hungry…
sometimes thirsty …

01:47:54.583 --> 01:47:56.958
Ok wait! Let me see!

01:47:59.292 --> 01:48:02.333
I had two inside … ten in all.

01:48:02.333 --> 01:48:04.333
Give me! Fast!

01:48:04.792 --> 01:48:06.167
Coachman!
Yes Bagelaji!

01:48:06.167 --> 01:48:10.167
If you find a place for drinking
water, stop there!

01:48:10.167 --> 01:48:13.542
There are sweetmeat shops on both sides...
the one on the right is crowded and the left

01:48:13.542 --> 01:48:16.083
shop is empty.

01:48:16.667 --> 01:48:18.417
Come son! Get down!

01:48:22.333 --> 01:48:24.542
Come son come!

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:29.833
Excuse me!

01:48:29.833 --> 01:48:31.833
Can we have drinking water?

01:48:31.833 --> 01:48:33.833
Yes!

01:48:37.875 --> 01:48:39.625
No no! No need for sweets!

01:48:39.625 --> 01:48:42.000
Just drinking water will do!
Have your seat please!

01:48:43.208 --> 01:48:45.458
Come, my son! Please sit!

01:48:45.458 --> 01:48:47.792
We're Bengali.

01:48:47.792 --> 01:48:50.458
We don't drink water in empty stomach!

01:48:50.458 --> 01:48:54.250
Have some sweets … then water.
Have your sit please!

01:48:54.250 --> 01:48:55.958
Come son! Eat!

01:48:55.958 --> 01:48:58.000
Hold it!

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:02.875
Papa! The sweet is excellent!

01:49:02.875 --> 01:49:04.458
Excellent!

01:49:07.125 --> 01:49:08.250
Is it good babu?

01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:10.083
Wow! What's the name of this sweet?

01:49:10.083 --> 01:49:11.125
Rosogolla.

01:49:11.125 --> 01:49:13.125
Do one thing.
Give me all of them.

01:49:13.125 --> 01:49:14.917
You'll take all the Rosogollas?

01:49:14.917 --> 01:49:18.625
Oh yes! Pack it!

01:49:18.625 --> 01:49:21.125
Maheshdada!

01:49:21.125 --> 01:49:22.792
This is an excellent sweet.

01:49:53.667 --> 01:49:56.125
Nobin's shop?

01:50:04.458 --> 01:50:06.750
Count the number of customers!

01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:08.292
Sir?

01:50:18.833 --> 01:50:20.208
Take it!

01:50:20.208 --> 01:50:21.250
What will you give me?

01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:24.917
You?
Here's your gift – Rosogolla!

01:50:24.917 --> 01:50:26.583
Rosogolla?

01:50:26.583 --> 01:50:29.417
Go! Give it quickly and come back!

01:50:31.042 --> 01:50:34.458
Didi! Dada gave this!

01:50:46.458 --> 01:50:48.792
Hi Sudhirbabu! What are these?

01:50:48.792 --> 01:50:50.375
My new son-in-law has come!

01:50:50.375 --> 01:50:53.375
Taking three sher rohu
and Nobin's Rosogolla …

01:50:53.375 --> 01:50:55.417
after all it's a question of prestige!

01:50:55.417 --> 01:50:57.250
Of course!

01:50:58.625 --> 01:51:01.750
It's my milk and that's my price...

01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:04.292
take it or leave it!

01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:20.917
Have you missed your way?

01:51:20.917 --> 01:51:26.542
I thought it was
the Mediterranean's distance...

01:51:26.542 --> 01:51:31.625
Vidyasagar too had to cross the river
Damodar when needed.

01:51:31.625 --> 01:51:33.333
What's the need?

01:51:33.333 --> 01:51:40.167
The anarchy that has been set regarding
the price of milk has to be resolved – isn't it?

01:51:42.458 --> 01:51:43.458
Anarchy?

01:51:43.458 --> 01:51:45.292
Don't you think it's anarchy?

01:51:45.292 --> 01:51:48.542
Previously, only Kashi milkman
used to charge more.

01:51:48.542 --> 01:51:52.833
After my improvemen in bussiness
all the milkmen are charging higher.

01:51:52.833 --> 01:51:55.458
Your sales, your money
… you resolve it!

01:51:57.750 --> 01:52:00.625
You invent so many new things…

01:52:01.833 --> 01:52:03.583
do something about it!

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:08.875
I will not only invent the sweet...
but also discover the path!

01:52:11.417 --> 01:52:14.875
Will the milkmen accept it?

01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:16.958
Nothing will happen with
my lone efforts!

01:52:16.958 --> 01:52:21.292
If you cannot get united,
their anarchy will increase day by day!

01:52:21.292 --> 01:52:25.167
For instance, Kali… he didn't
agree … will the others agree?

01:52:25.167 --> 01:52:28.792
They're actually scared of Kali uncle,
but they respect you!

01:52:28.792 --> 01:52:32.375
If you be on our side,
I'll convince others!

01:52:32.375 --> 01:52:39.208
Moira's son! Your behaviour, your
language … all have become sweet!

01:52:39.208 --> 01:52:42.000
You've cornered all of us!

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.667
That's why we've been compelled to
organize this meeting here!

01:52:45.667 --> 01:52:48.042
Milkman brothers!
I'm giving you this warning!

01:52:48.042 --> 01:52:52.417
If you do not keep the same price
throughout Kolkata,

01:52:52.417 --> 01:52:56.375
not one moira will
purchase a single drop of milk from you!

01:52:56.375 --> 01:52:57.958
Rightly said!

01:52:57.958 --> 01:53:03.667
That's why the price of milk that will be settled
here tonight in this milk depot of Bowbazar.

01:53:03.667 --> 01:53:08.458
…That will be the fixed price of milk from
tomorrow throughout Kolkata.

01:53:09.958 --> 01:53:12.500
You've started an unethical
business with milk.

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.458
Don't you feel ashamed of yourselves?

01:53:14.458 --> 01:53:16.458
Since we moiras have assembled here,

01:53:16.458 --> 01:53:20.417
Don't think that milk is
required only for making sweets.

01:53:20.417 --> 01:53:24.542
Children and the ailing people
also need it badly!

01:53:25.833 --> 01:53:30.792
No! Business doesn't mean
duping people.

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:35.708
Being honest also you can live happily.

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:39.792
Milkman brothers agreeing to our
proposal, raise your hands!

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.833
I say – raise your hands!

01:53:43.833 --> 01:53:46.875
What happened... raise your hands!

01:53:48.875 --> 01:53:50.458
What's your name?

01:53:50.458 --> 01:53:51.333
Ganguram.

01:53:51.333 --> 01:53:55.250
<i>Slowly the wind rises!</i>

01:53:57.292 --> 01:54:01.417
<i>The wind rises slowly!</i>

01:54:02.417 --> 01:54:06.125
<i>News floats in the air!</i>

01:54:07.833 --> 01:54:12.792
<i>Folk tales are born in every household!</i>

01:54:12.792 --> 01:54:19.083
<i>See slowly the wind is rising!
See the wind rising slowly!</i>

01:54:19.083 --> 01:54:21.833
<i>The wayward wind will turn...</i>

01:54:21.833 --> 01:54:24.458
<i>Into a Norwester cyclone!</i>

01:54:24.458 --> 01:54:27.375
<i>Oh young! Oh unripe!</i>

01:54:27.375 --> 01:54:30.000
<i>Save the half dead!</i>

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.750
<i>Oh young! Oh unripe!</i>

01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:35.458
<i>Break the cage!</i>

01:54:57.292 --> 01:55:02.708
<i>Carrying the baggage on
your shoulder Is not easy!</i>

01:55:02.708 --> 01:55:08.125
<i>You're the boatman that will
take people across the river!</i>

01:55:57.250 --> 01:56:00.542
I'm Rupchand Pakshi … I'll
have your rosogolla …

01:56:00.542 --> 01:56:04.333
I'll turn you into a bird
… Train you how to fly!

01:56:04.333 --> 01:56:06.042
He doesn't want to fly!

01:56:06.625 --> 01:56:09.292
Rupchand Pakshi's songs
are the pride of Bagbazar!

01:56:09.292 --> 01:56:12.292
Not me, you're our pride!

01:56:19.292 --> 01:56:22.000
<i>The absolutely impossible will happen!</i>

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.083
<i>Whatever has to happen will happen!</i>

01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:30.000
<i>The shadow of the dark
cloud has passed!</i>

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.417
<i>You self unconscious!
Listen with your sweet smile...</i>

01:56:35.417 --> 01:56:40.542
<i>Everyone has started following you!</i>

01:56:40.542 --> 01:56:45.500
<i>You're like that mad wind that
instigates the wings to fly</i>

01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:51.292
<i>All new thoughts have started flying!</i>

01:56:51.292 --> 01:56:56.875
<i>You're the target to that end
that makes the dream story...</i>

01:56:56.875 --> 01:57:02.417
<i>Everything has got tinged
in the new colour!</i>

01:57:31.292 --> 01:57:32.625
Come!

01:57:34.958 --> 01:57:37.417
Keep watch on the backside!
Yes! I'm going!

01:57:38.167 --> 01:57:42.750
<i>O Ghanashyam!
Appear before me!</i>

01:57:43.708 --> 01:57:45.958
Thief! Thief!

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:48.042
Hey Bipin! Come!
Catch the thief!

01:57:49.583 --> 01:57:51.792
Hold!
We're sweet makers not thieves!

01:57:51.792 --> 01:57:53.500
Stop! Stop!

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.875
Are you sweet makers?
Yes...

01:57:54.875 --> 01:57:57.917
Heard a lot about your Rosogolla!

01:57:57.917 --> 01:58:01.583
So we thought if we could learn
the tricks surreptitiously!

01:58:01.583 --> 01:58:05.750
Go! What are you waiting for?

01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:08.208
Get up please! Get up!
These people were trying to …

01:58:08.208 --> 01:58:09.792
Oh! Maheshdada!

01:58:09.792 --> 01:58:11.625
Look at their interest to learn!

01:58:11.625 --> 01:58:13.125
I'll teach you!

01:58:13.125 --> 01:58:15.208
You'll teach us?

01:58:15.208 --> 01:58:18.875
With the water from Ganga
worshipping Goddess Ganga!

01:58:18.875 --> 01:58:20.333
That's it!

01:58:20.333 --> 01:58:21.875
I've come from Krishnanagar.

01:58:21.875 --> 01:58:23.542
I'm from Belgachhia.

01:58:23.542 --> 01:58:24.708
I'm from Bardhaman.

01:58:24.708 --> 01:58:26.208
I've come from Baranagar.

01:58:28.583 --> 01:58:30.458
Did you understand Rammohan babu?

01:58:30.458 --> 01:58:32.208
Brajamohan … Brajamohan …

01:58:32.208 --> 01:58:35.583
When will you be practical?

01:58:35.583 --> 01:58:37.042
You're not listening to my words!

01:58:37.042 --> 01:58:40.417
How long will you teach people
to make Rosogolla?

01:58:40.417 --> 01:58:44.542
I have forbidden you to talk
with food in your mouth!

01:58:44.542 --> 01:58:46.792
Hey! Have you emptied your mouthful?

01:58:46.792 --> 01:58:48.458
Ma! But I haven't spoken a word!

01:58:48.458 --> 01:58:51.875
Khirod … but I've reduced
teaching... isn't it?

01:58:51.875 --> 01:58:54.083
I don't understand
why you are so angry on me!

01:58:54.083 --> 01:58:55.917
Oho! It's very unjustified to be angry!

01:58:55.917 --> 01:59:00.750
Will you become Raja Harishchandra
by giving away our hard earned thing?

01:59:00.750 --> 01:59:04.458
May I tell you one thing?
Will you obey me?

01:59:04.458 --> 01:59:07.042
Will I tell it before taking food or after?
Speak up!

01:59:07.042 --> 01:59:09.375
I mean, I'll have to go to
Bardhaman to teach …

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.542
Going to European locality for
teaching them …

01:59:19.375 --> 01:59:22.000
Then Dulalbabu …

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.583
Careful!

01:59:23.583 --> 01:59:24.750
Are you all right?

01:59:25.583 --> 01:59:27.625
Hemen!

01:59:27.625 --> 01:59:28.833
Call Dulal!

01:59:28.833 --> 01:59:31.875
Actually sweet had never been
patented before!

01:59:31.875 --> 01:59:35.000
Had an intention of mesmerizing people by
doing it for the first time.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.333
Stall your hard work!

01:59:38.083 --> 01:59:40.417
Better try this one!

01:59:42.833 --> 01:59:46.375
Impressed! Impressed!

01:59:46.375 --> 01:59:49.375
Because you underestimated me!

01:59:50.042 --> 01:59:53.083
I'm one of those few native
Indians...

01:59:53.083 --> 01:59:54.833
...who are graduates.

01:59:55.625 --> 01:59:59.292
See! See it for yourself!
New discovery!

02:00:00.542 --> 02:00:04.542
Give! Give him
the rosogolla made by you.

02:00:04.542 --> 02:00:07.042
He makes rosogolla.
His rosogolla?

02:00:07.042 --> 02:00:08.833
I mean Nabinbabu has taught me...

02:00:08.833 --> 02:00:10.458
Who knows that?

02:00:10.458 --> 02:00:11.625
What do you mean?

02:00:11.625 --> 02:00:15.792
I mean give Banikbabu the rosogolla
made by you.

02:00:28.958 --> 02:00:32.750
Can a dog's stomach digest butter?

02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:39.458
Is it fair to give the moon to a person who
doesn't understand its worth?

02:00:39.458 --> 02:00:41.292
No! It's not fair!

02:00:41.292 --> 02:00:42.917
Not good at all!

02:00:44.333 --> 02:00:45.417
The sweet.

02:00:47.833 --> 02:00:49.833
Have you tasted the Rosogolla
made by Nobinbabu?

02:00:49.833 --> 02:00:51.875
If you did,
you would have known.

02:00:51.875 --> 02:00:56.625
One who can make that Rosogolla,
let me try to get the moon for him first …

02:00:56.625 --> 02:01:01.833
then we can think of this dwarf!
Bye!

02:01:01.833 --> 02:01:03.917
Excuse me brother!

02:01:06.958 --> 02:01:09.458
Will you taste one?

02:01:16.708 --> 02:01:20.208
If at all I have,
I'll have the original.

02:01:22.042 --> 02:01:24.292
Impressive!

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.333
Female entrepreneur!
This is future – right?

02:01:28.333 --> 02:01:31.250
Nice meeting you!
I'm a patent agent.

02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:33.083
What tet?

02:01:33.083 --> 02:01:36.292
Sweet! Not tet … it's patent.

02:01:36.292 --> 02:01:38.042
Patent.

02:01:38.042 --> 02:01:45.792
In future, in this entire world, whoever makes
this Rosogolla, you'll get the royalty.

02:01:47.375 --> 02:01:49.833
True?
Oh yes!

02:01:49.833 --> 02:01:53.167
I don't want to listen to your words!
You'll have to patent it.

02:01:53.167 --> 02:01:54.625
I'll not patent it.

02:01:54.625 --> 02:01:56.583
Why? What's your problem?

02:01:56.583 --> 02:01:57.958
Try to understand for once!

02:01:57.958 --> 02:01:59.833
I taught so many people hands on.

02:01:59.833 --> 02:02:03.042
Now if I ask money from them,
will it not be duping them?

02:02:03.042 --> 02:02:08.250
This is as if I give seeds to a
farmer and ask him to grow crops …

02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:13.292
and then I say – you'll never be able
to grow crops without my seeds …

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:14.375
That's not done!

02:02:14.375 --> 02:02:18.792
Hey! Where are you going?
But … but my coconut?

02:02:18.792 --> 02:02:22.250
So you'll not patent it?

02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:25.500
No! He's not agreeing to it in any way.

02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:27.250
Bad! Very bad!

02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:30.208
In reality, you've actually made
it for the first time!

02:02:30.208 --> 02:02:32.667
And now everyone can do it!

02:02:32.667 --> 02:02:37.708
If any of them gets the patents,
then Rosogolla will belong to him.

02:02:37.708 --> 02:02:44.083
Then you have to buy Rosogolla
that you've invented!

02:02:44.083 --> 02:02:44.917
Bye!

02:02:47.833 --> 02:02:49.583
What are you doing Khirod?

02:02:49.583 --> 02:02:52.000
I'll not listen to you...
will you take the patent or not?

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.750
Why are you getting so angry?
Why not?

02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:57.708
We'll have to pay for
what we've made?

02:02:57.708 --> 02:02:59.042
Who's putting weird things
in your head?

02:02:59.042 --> 02:03:00.167
Dad, will you play with me?

02:03:00.167 --> 02:03:02.833
Go! Go away from here!

02:03:03.625 --> 02:03:06.125
Wonderful!

02:03:06.125 --> 02:03:08.917
Ok! What do the people whom
you teach give you?

02:03:08.917 --> 02:03:10.625
Nothing more than a wrapper!

02:03:10.625 --> 02:03:15.750
Khirod, I'm telling you for the last time...
listen to me carefully …

02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:18.083
If I ask for money from
the persons I've taught,

02:03:18.083 --> 02:03:22.458
people will think I've taught
them for personal gain!

02:03:22.458 --> 02:03:26.000
You always hanker for your name…
you want people to praise you always!

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.917
What did you say?
What do you want?

02:03:27.917 --> 02:03:29.792
Do you want us to starve?

02:03:29.792 --> 02:03:34.208
If you do not take the patent,
I'll go to my father's house and take Khoka along…

02:03:34.208 --> 02:03:37.500
and will never return.
I will...

02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:39.458
never take... Patent!

02:03:40.417 --> 02:03:50.625
<i>As dark as the black bumblebee</i>

02:03:50.625 --> 02:03:55.167
<i>my friend, when will you come,</i>

02:03:55.167 --> 02:04:00.167
<i>tell me, oh tell me!</i>

02:04:26.417 --> 02:04:29.542
Khirod! Open the door please!

02:04:29.542 --> 02:04:31.125
Have you taken the patent?

02:04:31.125 --> 02:04:34.375
Why this same issue...

02:04:34.375 --> 02:04:41.000
Your wife will tolerate all your whims
… not a mother.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.083
You had promised me
you would not make me cry any more?

02:04:48.333 --> 02:04:50.667
Answer me...

02:04:50.667 --> 02:04:57.375
<i>If you want to go, my friend...
Leave back the towel on your shoulder!</i>

02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:31.833
Hey!
Give me five Rosogollas...

02:05:31.833 --> 02:05:34.167
Hi Hemen!
After such a long time?

02:05:34.167 --> 02:05:35.833
Give me five Rosogollas.
I'll take them along!

02:05:35.833 --> 02:05:38.542
You've come after so many days!
Come inside!

02:05:38.542 --> 02:05:41.333
Not for me! It's for Kalibabu …

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:44.042
I was forbidden to tell you!

02:05:44.042 --> 02:05:46.333
Please do not tell anyone!
Kalibabu will have it?

02:05:46.333 --> 02:05:50.042
Hey Nobin! Come soon!

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:53.208
Kalibabu will have Rosogolla!

02:05:53.208 --> 02:05:55.458
I haven't said anything!

02:06:19.917 --> 02:06:24.333
Now price of milk is the same throughout
Kolkata. What else do you want?

02:06:24.333 --> 02:06:26.542
No…

02:06:26.542 --> 02:06:30.125
I've come to feed you Rosogolla!

02:06:30.125 --> 02:06:31.500
Me?

02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.000
Why?

02:06:33.875 --> 02:06:35.833
Everyone says...

02:06:35.833 --> 02:06:39.292
at bad times one needs
the blessings of elders!

02:06:39.292 --> 02:06:40.333
That's why …

02:06:42.875 --> 02:06:46.375
Sales of your shop is so high...

02:06:46.375 --> 02:06:48.958
and you talk of bad time!

02:06:48.958 --> 02:06:50.833
Khirod is not there at home …

02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:55.083
What shall I do with the high sale?

02:07:00.833 --> 02:07:02.958
Take!

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:38.083
All right! That's all right!

02:07:46.542 --> 02:07:49.792
May I leave?
Yes!

02:07:51.583 --> 02:07:53.167
Wait!

02:08:03.833 --> 02:08:06.208
Will you teach me...?

02:08:06.208 --> 02:08:11.250
<i>Messenger of God...</i>

02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:15.250
Hey! Go!

02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:17.417
A good beating will make you right!

02:08:17.417 --> 02:08:18.792
Bipin! What's this going on?

02:08:18.792 --> 02:08:21.542
Bipin! What's this going on?

02:08:21.542 --> 02:08:24.708
Dada! He's disturbing since long!
I don't want to listen to anything!

02:08:24.708 --> 02:08:27.875
Never behave like this
and give him some water!

02:08:29.708 --> 02:08:31.083
Dada!

02:08:33.792 --> 02:08:36.542
Nobin Kishore...

02:08:46.875 --> 02:08:50.292
Have some water!

02:08:50.292 --> 02:08:52.292
Slow! Slow!

02:08:53.458 --> 02:08:54.958
Drink slowly!

02:08:57.583 --> 02:09:01.917
I've been the cause of
a great loss for you!

02:09:01.917 --> 02:09:03.750
That's all right!

02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:06.167
The time was not ripe for business.

02:09:06.167 --> 02:09:09.292
No!

02:09:09.292 --> 02:09:13.625
There was nothing wrong in your sweet.

02:09:13.625 --> 02:09:20.500
By mistake, my opium balls had
fallen in it from my pocket.

02:09:21.625 --> 02:09:26.750
I was scared to tell you that!

02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:32.000
Pardon me!
Pardon me please!

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.750
Maheshdada! It was right!

02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:38.250
My sweet was absolutely right,
Maheshdada!

02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:41.833
Chondubabu, you do not
know what good you've done to me!

02:09:41.833 --> 02:09:44.125
I'll make new sweet now!

02:09:45.083 --> 02:09:48.083
I'll pacify Khirod with the new sweet
and bring her back.

02:09:48.083 --> 02:09:49.875
After all, our relationship is only
about sweet... isn't it?

02:09:49.875 --> 02:09:50.625
Of course.

02:09:50.625 --> 02:09:53.083
Chondubabu, what's your name?

02:09:53.083 --> 02:09:54.292
Chondu.

02:09:54.292 --> 02:09:55.375
No no! Your good name!

02:09:55.375 --> 02:10:01.917
After ma died, no one called me by
that name for many years now!

02:10:01.917 --> 02:10:03.792
We'll call you … just tell us!

02:10:03.792 --> 02:10:07.792
Boikuntha Gangopadhyay …

02:10:07.792 --> 02:10:10.208
I'll give your name to my sweet…

02:10:10.208 --> 02:10:11.375
...is it ok?

02:10:11.375 --> 02:10:13.125
'Boikunthabhog'!

02:10:13.125 --> 02:10:15.083
Nobin!

02:10:15.083 --> 02:10:18.458
See! The streak of madness
has returned!

02:10:18.458 --> 02:10:19.583
But you do not go away!

02:10:21.042 --> 02:10:26.917
Listen! Get him shaved and
dressed properly!

02:10:34.625 --> 02:10:36.417
Khirod...

02:10:36.417 --> 02:10:37.750
Khirod, I've come!

02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:42.292
I know you do not want to see
my nose, lips, eyes … nothing!

02:10:42.292 --> 02:10:48.250
Don't you know how inauspicious
it is if I don't feed you first?

02:10:48.250 --> 02:10:50.042
Take this! Just smell it!

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:54.000
I've made this new sweet!
'Boikunthabhog'!

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.750
Oh! What an aroma!

02:10:55.750 --> 02:11:00.292
If I didn't have to feed you first,
I myself would have taken it!

02:11:00.292 --> 02:11:03.792
Please Khirod!
Don't do like that!

02:11:03.792 --> 02:11:05.000
Just hold it!

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.167
Have been running the entire life!

02:11:07.167 --> 02:11:08.000
Khirod!

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.458
Please don't do like that!
Please try to understand!

02:11:10.458 --> 02:11:12.708
Don't get angry!
Khirod! I've understood!

02:11:12.708 --> 02:11:15.042
Patent! Isn't it?

02:11:15.042 --> 02:11:18.000
We didn't have anything…

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.208
Now we've so much!

02:11:19.208 --> 02:11:21.708
We've our house,
our shop, our sweet …

02:11:21.708 --> 02:11:22.875
We've our son …

02:11:24.458 --> 02:11:26.250
What do you think?

02:11:31.125 --> 02:11:32.375
Think!

02:11:32.375 --> 02:11:35.083
Instead of these hands,
if another man's hands held you!

02:11:35.083 --> 02:11:36.208
Go! Nothing stops you
from saying things!

02:11:36.208 --> 02:11:37.125
Don't feel ashamed?

02:11:37.125 --> 02:11:38.833
Exactly … I'm saying that only …

02:11:38.833 --> 02:11:43.625
Whoever makes Rosogolla
in the entire world...

02:11:43.625 --> 02:11:48.792
Nobin's hands will be Nobin's only!

02:11:50.125 --> 02:11:53.917
I'll make many more new and
newer sweet Khirod!

02:11:53.917 --> 02:11:56.125
Only you be with me!

02:11:56.125 --> 02:11:57.625
Look at this...

02:11:57.625 --> 02:12:00.625
'Boikunthabhog'!

02:12:00.625 --> 02:12:03.167
I made it!

02:12:26.208 --> 02:12:27.833
When will you grow up my dear?

02:12:28.542 --> 02:12:31.292
What do I gain in growing up?

02:12:32.875 --> 02:12:34.458
You're there – isn't it?

02:12:35.667 --> 02:12:37.958
With what did you make
this 'Boikunthabhog'?

02:12:39.708 --> 02:12:41.917
With love...

02:12:58.125 --> 02:13:01.792

There ends my story!</i>
