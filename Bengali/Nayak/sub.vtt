WEBVTT

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.569
So, you're going!

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.312
Good.

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.043
I'm glad you changed your mind.

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:52.115
After all, it's an official award.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.028
There's a prestige in getting it.

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.570
I don't care about the award.

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.920
I just want to get away
from all the problems for a day.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.815
In a way, it's good
I couldn't get on the plane.

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:04.577
If you'd decided
earlier, you could

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:05.901
have got a whole
coupé to yourself.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:09.139
Now, you'll have to share.
- Makes no difference.

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:11.784
I'll just take some
sleeping pills and sleep.

00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:17.188
I won't even notice if
anybody's there or not.

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.440
Shall I send a telegram to Delhi
so that they meet you?

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:25.596
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.742
A telegram won't reach there.
Call them.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.625
Call Sunil as well. 22464.

00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:45.996
Oh no! Even 180 is engaged.

00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:50.155
What are they saying about the film?

00:03:50.912 --> 00:03:52.355
This is only the second week.

00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:54.151
It ought to be clear by now.

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:58.341
End of the month.
People don't have a lot of money.

00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:02.672
I never heard such things before.
Why this time?

00:04:03.078 --> 00:04:05.683
What is good in that film,
except you?

00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:10.123
I'm in it. Isn't that enough?

00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:14.007
Not enough, I'm afraid.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.925
Times have changed.

00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:18.302
Nonsense!

00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:20.289
Stupid public!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.066
Whimsical. Wipe 'em all out.

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.660
Bravo! And what would you eat then?

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.902
Boiled fish and rice from that place
we used to go to.

00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:30.467
That's very difficult, brother.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:34.166
Even I need the best Darjeeling tea
with my breakfast.

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:35.675
And I'm only a satellite.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.022
Read the last section
in the third column.

00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:39.841
Hello? Trunk call.

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:41.885
4 5...

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:47.001
But how did this...?

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:50.326
How long?
- Just five minutes.

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:51.738
Come on.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:58.923
Are you going to Delhi?
- Looks like it.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.834
Very lucky. I could have missed you.

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:04.283
Would you like anything besides tea?
- No.

00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:07.503
Banana?
- Only tea.

00:05:08.484 --> 00:05:11.622
I bet Tarak Chatterjee
is behind this. How dare he!

00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:15.114
Call Phani and tell him
I'm sorry. I have to go.

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:17.277
I'll book 16th for him.

00:05:17.444 --> 00:05:19.613
And Fortune Films?
- To heck with them.

00:05:19.863 --> 00:05:22.820
No. I shall have to deal with them.

00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:25.676
Now, sir, let's just
finish my business.

00:05:26.938 --> 00:05:28.361
What? A contract?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.594
What does the almanac say?
Is it a good day for contracts?

00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:33.899
Yes! Most auspicious!

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:37.057
But my almanac says the opposite,
Mr Hiralal.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:38.956
The opposite? What almanac?

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.204
It says, good for travel,

00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:44.627
but bad for contracts.

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:47.204
You're joking.

00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:49.748
Do you read the newspaper?
- Newspaper?

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:53.741
Apart from the share market?
- I haven't yet read today's.

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:56.241
Then you don't know the news.
- What news?

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:00.660
The night before last,

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.753
at a certain club,

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:09.163
in a state of slight inebriation,

00:06:09.757 --> 00:06:11.526
I thrashed a certain gentleman.

00:06:12.194 --> 00:06:15.195
Thrashed?
- I mean, the old one-two.

00:06:15.713 --> 00:06:17.422
One two...?

00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:22.867
I beat him up, understand?
- Oh, beat him up!

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:25.431
Yes!

00:06:26.026 --> 00:06:27.697
The gentleman

00:06:28.272 --> 00:06:30.354
insulted me.
- Really?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.619
And he did that

00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:36.570
in front of some ladies.
- Oh my God!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.118
You realise in the circumstances
this couldn't be tolerated.

00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:42.751
Of course, not! Of course, not.

00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:46.197
But that gentleman was not aware

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.061
that I had special aptitude

00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:52.525
for one particular role.
- Right.

00:06:52.963 --> 00:06:54.278
And that role

00:06:55.396 --> 00:06:57.296
is of a pugilist.
- A pugi...?

00:06:57.907 --> 00:07:00.176
I mean, I gave him one.

00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.950
Oh, good! Good!

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:07.382
Although, if one drinks too much,
it is tough to aim right.

00:07:07.957 --> 00:07:11.998
But it stopped the gentleman
from being clever.

00:07:12.023 --> 00:07:15.728
Right, right!
You did the right thing.

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:19.903
You did the right thing.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.043
But, in spite of our
best efforts to hush it up,

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:29.014
it came out today in two papers.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.164
So what, Mr Mukherjee?

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.653
Nothing, Mr Hiralal.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.012
It's just that...

00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:44.915
I don't feel like
signing any contracts today.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.048
But it was all settled.

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:49.113
Not in the mood. Let it wait.

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:50.931
But I brought you an advance.

00:07:50.956 --> 00:07:53.787
I'll be back on Wednesday.
We'll discuss it then.

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:00.663
Please hold on. He's coming.

00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:07.188
Who is it?
- Your leading lady.

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:20.119
Yes?

00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:22.849
Are you going to Delhi?
- Yes.

00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:24.514
By train?
- By train, yes.

00:08:24.948 --> 00:08:28.199
Should I come to the station?
- I'd rather you didn't.

00:08:28.818 --> 00:08:31.753
You misunderstood me, Arindam.
- Probably not.

00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:35.596
But I can explain everything.
- It won't be necessary.

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:39.720
Why are you behaving like this?
- It isn't without good reason.

00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:41.095
What reason?

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:44.413
Tell me, Arindam, please!

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.649
I don't have time for that.
I'm going.

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:50.312
Bye.

00:08:58.085 --> 00:08:59.591
Up, you go!

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:04.832
Will she need anything special?

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:07.704
If you could arrange
for some chicken stew...

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.430
Chicken stew!

00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:12.778
Dad, give me my book
from your bag, please.

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:16.346
Sure. But don't strain
your eyes too much with reading.

00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:18.290
Will you have lunch in
your coupé, Sir?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.680
What? - Will you have lunch
in your coupé?

00:09:22.943 --> 00:09:24.485
They'll have it here.

00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:29.262
I'll go to the dining car.

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:36.272
Is Mr Bose travelling by this train?

00:09:36.822 --> 00:09:38.585
Mr Bose...?
- Haren Bose.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.059
Oh yes. He's in compartment D
with his family.

00:09:47.567 --> 00:09:49.394
Do you still have doubts?

00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:52.552
You never know.
He may have changed his plans.

00:09:53.162 --> 00:09:54.458
He's such a busy man...

00:09:56.739 --> 00:09:59.042
I'd be glad if he did.
- What?

00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:03.706
I don't like mixing work
with holidays.

00:10:03.843 --> 00:10:06.118
Do you know how much they spend
on advertising?

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:08.468
This upper seat is yours!

00:10:08.568 --> 00:10:10.416
Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:12.204
Porter, bring the bags carefully.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.564
Rs 500,000!

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:17.705
Do you get it?
If I get him my entire work...

00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:18.799
Arindam!

00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:20.418
Who?
- Arindam Mukherjee!

00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:24.765
'It will leave at 11:05 am.'

00:10:25.913 --> 00:10:29.426
'Platform number 8...'

00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:31.460
If the coupé is inconvenient,

00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:33.847
there's room in a four
berth compartment.

00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:36.106
Why inconvenient?

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:39.181
Well, your companion
would be Mr Aghore Chatterjee.

00:10:39.443 --> 00:10:42.143
My God! He wants to wipe out
the whole film industry.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.114
Oh, he's the one who writes
letters to The Statesman!

00:10:45.287 --> 00:10:49.107
Yes. He got a bit worried
when he heard that you would be...

00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:50.840
Let's go and see him, anyway.

00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:56.267
Sir, this is Mr Chatterjee.

00:10:57.388 --> 00:10:58.388
Hello.

00:10:58.693 --> 00:11:01.475
So, you're the film star?
- Yes, sir.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.704
I never go to the
cinema on principle.

00:11:06.835 --> 00:11:10.583
In 1942, my friend
had forced me to watch

00:11:11.402 --> 00:11:13.614
'How Green Was My Valley.'

00:11:13.852 --> 00:11:15.160
That's a good film!

00:11:15.657 --> 00:11:18.519
But as a rule, films are bad!

00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:21.748
But why blame us poor actors?

00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:26.161
Do you drink?

00:11:27.793 --> 00:11:31.606
Well, yes, a little.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:36.677
Yes. Film actors drink a lot.

00:11:37.308 --> 00:11:39.379
That's because...

00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:44.168
It shows a lack of decency
and lack of discipline.

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:47.339
Are you going to drink
on this journey?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.004
Well, yes, it's my second nature.

00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:55.629
Well, then, I'm obliged to tell you

00:11:56.182 --> 00:12:00.601
that the smell of alcohol
makes me nauseous.

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:03.291
And my...

00:12:03.437 --> 00:12:06.549
I am 79. And as such I expect

00:12:06.796 --> 00:12:09.558
some consideration
from my fellow passengers.

00:12:10.254 --> 00:12:12.885
Don't you worry, sir.
I'm in another compartment.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.606
I have heard of you,
read your letters,

00:12:14.631 --> 00:12:17.011
so I just came to pay my respects.
- Oh, I see!

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.311
Okay, bye, then.
- Bye.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.830
You've got a lower berth.
It might be a little uncomfortable.

00:12:24.872 --> 00:12:27.084
No, this is fine!
- Very nice.

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:29.943
Wow! It's brand new!
- Come on.

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:32.249
Mom!
- Quiet!

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:36.469
100.4.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.914
They should have some sense.
Foisting him on us!

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:43.670
What's so bad about it?
- Didn't you read the news today?

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:49.452
Yes, but he's going to
Delhi for the award.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.627
Scandalous!

00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:54.636
Listen! Open this bottle.

00:13:01.255 --> 00:13:03.714
Hey!

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.710
Arindam, bye!

00:13:06.763 --> 00:13:09.016
Three cheers for
Arindam Mukhopadhyay!

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.709
In Delhi, I'll show
you the Jama Masjid.

00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:14.718
And...
- And the Qutab Minar too.

00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:15.768
And?

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:20.041
Thank you.
- Hello.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.086
Darn it!

00:13:28.602 --> 00:13:29.746
Disgusting!

00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:33.894
Isn't there some boy or attendant?
Call him for help.

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:35.925
What is it? A screw cap?

00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:37.913
God knows why they have to...

00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:40.775
May I try?

00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:45.567
All right, but opening it...

00:13:53.202 --> 00:13:54.207
Here you are.

00:13:55.874 --> 00:13:56.893
Thanks.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.020
It isn't so easy
if your palms are sweating.

00:14:02.027 --> 00:14:05.274
Yes, perspiration...

00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:13.488
I want to congratulate you.

00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:15.464
Me?

00:14:16.132 --> 00:14:17.780
For opening the screw cap?
- No.

00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:19.853
You're going to Delhi
to get an award, right?

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:21.879
I see. Thanks.

00:14:23.371 --> 00:14:26.342
What's wrong with her? - She has
been feverish for a month now.

00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:28.330
Her temperature is still above 100.

00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:31.532
She's a great fan of yours.
- Is that so?

00:14:32.444 --> 00:14:35.076
We haven't watched
your new film yet.

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:38.532
Just as well.
- Don't say that!

00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:41.157
We never miss a film of yours.

00:14:41.912 --> 00:14:44.383
This time, we couldn't watch it
due to her illness.

00:14:44.996 --> 00:14:48.377
Your film released
right after she fell ill.

00:14:51.493 --> 00:14:55.047
Do you film people
have import export problems too?

00:14:56.767 --> 00:15:00.266
Absolutely, just like
any other industry.

00:15:01.475 --> 00:15:04.388
I've noticed that the Japanese
film industry is growing rapidly.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.515
America, of course,
was always well ahead.

00:15:08.412 --> 00:15:10.976
But, this time, I noticed a slump.

00:15:11.615 --> 00:15:13.606
The studios are all idle.

00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:17.218
Or they are making films
for television.

00:15:18.173 --> 00:15:19.735
It made me feel sad.

00:15:20.363 --> 00:15:23.188
After all, there is nothing
to beat American movies.

00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:26.806
Yes, very true. After all,
I've learnt acting from them.

00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:28.953
Don't mind my saying this, sir,

00:15:29.371 --> 00:15:32.104
but we haven't yet learnt
to care about quality.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.119
Our motto seems to be,

00:15:34.373 --> 00:15:36.813
'Produce more and produce rubbish!'

00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:40.413
Right.

00:15:41.394 --> 00:15:45.911
That's why family
planning is so important.

00:15:48.652 --> 00:15:49.773
Oh my!

00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.985
You publish this magazine
on your own!

00:15:52.097 --> 00:15:54.401
Not quite.
There are two others helping me.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.726
But it's my initiative.

00:15:57.936 --> 00:15:59.717
All written by women!

00:15:59.965 --> 00:16:01.020
Look at all this.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.530
I go through the proof.
There's no shortage of material.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.762
Do you make a profit?

00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:10.575
We could, with a few
more advertisements.

00:16:11.023 --> 00:16:14.687
You know a lot of people.
Why don't you help her out?

00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:17.565
You could begin by taking
a subscription for your wife.

00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:21.125
Gladly! What's the damage?
- Ten rupees a year.

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:23.425
In these matters,
I have no hesitation.

00:16:24.426 --> 00:16:25.456
Just look at him!

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:28.341
Who should I write the receipt to?
- Shefalika Devi.

00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:32.430
You go from house to house
collecting subscriptions.

00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:35.105
You'll find lots of
husbands like mine,

00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:37.344
who'll take one look at you
and pay up ten rupees.

00:16:38.543 --> 00:16:42.085
I'm going to Delhi to
arrange some grant.

00:16:42.593 --> 00:16:45.204
I have an uncle, who works
in the Education Ministry.

00:16:45.249 --> 00:16:47.830
I hope you don't mind me calling you
by your first name.

00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:49.284
Not at all.

00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:51.273
Thank you.

00:16:54.037 --> 00:16:55.079
Hey!

00:16:56.711 --> 00:16:59.320
So, this is your lucky day!

00:17:00.092 --> 00:17:01.926
Isn't that true?

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.888
Arindam Mukherjee, isn't it?
- Yes.

00:17:04.987 --> 00:17:06.588
Don't you think he's wonderful?

00:17:06.613 --> 00:17:08.135
I haven't seen many of his films,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.472
but he is a good actor.

00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:14.049
Hey! There was something about him
in today's newspaper.

00:17:14.611 --> 00:17:16.757
He got into a fight with somebody.

00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:19.395
Speak a bit louder
and he might hear you.

00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:21.911
I'll just get an autograph
for Mithu.

00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:24.835
Excuse me.

00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:27.684
Can I have an autograph?
- Oh, yes. Certainly!

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:33.935
For a cousin of mine.

00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:38.842
I see.

00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.078
I didn't think you were
the autograph-hunting type.

00:17:44.378 --> 00:17:46.463
I don't suppose you have the bad
habit of watching Bengali films.

00:17:46.487 --> 00:17:49.153
Not many.
- You don't like them, do you?

00:17:50.301 --> 00:17:51.834
Too removed from reality!

00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:57.258
You're right.

00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:01.964
Educated young ladies

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.653
shouldn't burst into
a song of separation.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.252
And heroes shouldn't be so God-like.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.094
I'll take your leave. Thank you.

00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:20.858
I wonder what he thought.

00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:22.427
Why?

00:18:22.498 --> 00:18:25.856
I never can keep the truth
to myself. - What truth?

00:18:27.069 --> 00:18:28.704
Did you watch 'Jay Parajay'?

00:18:30.124 --> 00:18:31.780
Yes! He played tennis in it, right?

00:18:32.262 --> 00:18:34.421
He doesn't just play,
he's the champion!

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:36.971
Tennis champion, swimming champion,

00:18:37.194 --> 00:18:40.290
dancer, singer, leading progressive,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.481
topper in his masters, great lover!
Is that believable?

00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:47.116
She thinks so.
- I don't care what you say.

00:18:47.745 --> 00:18:50.858
I don't think about all that
when I watch him.

00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:54.716
I'll tell you what it is,
he's a modern Casanova.

00:18:55.285 --> 00:18:57.662
And all these ladies
are his admirers.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.300
Waiter!
- No, let me pay.

00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:02.925
No, you mustn't.

00:19:26.835 --> 00:19:29.374
Molly, he's gone to the
dining car. I'll go too.

00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:31.073
What about me?

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.283
You come too, but not just yet.

00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:37.068
It takes time to hook a big fish.
- All right.

00:19:40.205 --> 00:19:43.705
Hey, you're angry!
- I told you it's all right.

00:19:45.405 --> 00:19:49.119
Listen, if we can convince him,
next birthday you get a...

00:19:49.367 --> 00:19:50.473
Pearl necklace!

00:19:51.966 --> 00:19:52.974
Yes. Done.

00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:59.329
Darjeeling right next door
and you don't serve tea!

00:19:59.995 --> 00:20:02.312
You will be served tea
at the tea time, sir.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.265
If you want a cold drink now...

00:20:04.597 --> 00:20:05.797
Well, can I have a beer?

00:20:06.745 --> 00:20:08.579
We can't serve alcohol...

00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:10.570
Well, can I have a Coke then?

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:12.333
A Coke?

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.857
Coca Cola!
- Coca Cola!

00:20:15.457 --> 00:20:17.803
Coca Cola! Yes, sir.
- One for me too.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.612
May I join you, sir?

00:20:23.087 --> 00:20:24.120
Have a seat.

00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:28.085
I don't think we know...
- But I know you. Mr Bose, right?

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.596
Good heavens!
But I'm not a film star!

00:20:32.096 --> 00:20:35.826
I'm more likely to have heard of you
than of any film star.

00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:37.520
Really?

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:41.663
Pritish...

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.264
Rhymes with British.

00:20:43.794 --> 00:20:44.977
Spectrum Publicity.

00:20:46.202 --> 00:20:47.221
Why 'Spectrum' '?

00:20:48.201 --> 00:20:51.703
That indicates the range
of our interest.

00:20:52.483 --> 00:20:53.616
That may be so,

00:20:54.413 --> 00:20:56.928
but it does not indicate
your speciality.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.028
You know Mr Nandi, don't you?
The owner of Bengal Biscuits.

00:21:01.813 --> 00:21:02.907
Who? Jitesh?

00:21:04.164 --> 00:21:05.167
He was my classmate.

00:21:07.236 --> 00:21:08.238
We handle

00:21:10.682 --> 00:21:12.786
their account.
You may ask him about us.

00:21:13.762 --> 00:21:15.703
Jitesh was a good hockey player.

00:21:18.504 --> 00:21:21.979
I can show you samples of our work.
Very modern and effective.

00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:26.123
After all, you know
what's being done abroad.

00:21:26.423 --> 00:21:28.320
You have been all around the world.

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:30.746
By the grace of God, yes.

00:21:30.895 --> 00:21:33.675
Why just God?
Thanks to your abilities too.

00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:37.655
I know that's the
wisdom of our times.

00:21:38.387 --> 00:21:42.493
God does nothing.
Man does everything.

00:21:42.556 --> 00:21:45.852
Oh no! Only the extreme leftists
would say that.

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:48.945
You keep to the right, I presume.

00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:51.046
Not quite.

00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:55.374
You see, these days, every
young man leans a bit to the left.

00:21:56.832 --> 00:22:00.476
I don't like extreme conservatism.
- Certainly not.

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:04.579
But in our profession,
we depend on private enterprise.

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:24.268
They have excelled with these
trains. Something to be proud of.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:26.787
Yes, sir.

00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:40.516
Did you read it?

00:22:41.808 --> 00:22:44.829
He doesn't seem to have had
much of a struggle.

00:22:44.895 --> 00:22:47.896
He is in one now.
What to do with so much money?

00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:50.049
I'm sure finding a solution
is a huge struggle.

00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:53.073
I suppose, it's mainly
a matter of luck.

00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:54.823
80% of it.

00:22:55.205 --> 00:22:56.965
Hey, I have an idea.

00:22:57.477 --> 00:22:59.940
Talk to the man
and write an article.

00:23:00.215 --> 00:23:01.811
Then publish it in your magazine.

00:23:02.245 --> 00:23:04.994
It will increase your sales!
- Why don't you admit it?

00:23:05.379 --> 00:23:09.056
You want to find out more behind
the story in the newspaper today.

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:10.594
You don't know anything!

00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:13.115
Okay, you tell me.
Isn't that a good idea?

00:23:13.247 --> 00:23:14.947
Wasn't my advice good for you?

00:23:15.809 --> 00:23:17.929
I am thinking of keeping films

00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:21.529
of my paper.
- That's silly.

00:23:21.786 --> 00:23:24.404
You can't ignore film
related news these days.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.522
So I guessed from readers' letters.

00:23:27.547 --> 00:23:29.094
That settles it, then. Go on.

00:23:30.038 --> 00:23:31.038
Go on.

00:23:32.226 --> 00:23:34.084
Wait, I'll toss and decide.

00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:38.997
Here you are.

00:23:39.757 --> 00:23:41.465
You toss. If it's heads, I'll go.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.122
What is it this time?

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.210
Another cousin?

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:05.294
Do you mind if I
bother you once again?

00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:06.745
Bother me?

00:24:07.457 --> 00:24:10.744
But if you mind, you may refuse me.

00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:13.359
Object to being bothered?

00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:15.965
Well, actually...

00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:18.919
I just wanted to ask you
some questions. - My God!

00:24:20.103 --> 00:24:22.877
You're not a journalist, are you?
- No.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:25.478
I edit

00:24:26.354 --> 00:24:27.620
a women's magazine.

00:24:30.481 --> 00:24:32.439
'Aadhunik'. Please have a seat.

00:24:35.862 --> 00:24:39.088
Nothing about films
in here, I suppose.

00:24:39.663 --> 00:24:42.780
I was hoping to put that right
by interviewing you.

00:24:43.307 --> 00:24:46.211
Now that I've got you here...
- Got me?

00:24:49.183 --> 00:24:51.627
I mean, considering you're here

00:24:52.234 --> 00:24:56.983
and being the most
popular star these days.

00:24:57.242 --> 00:25:02.480
Listen, my life story has been
published so many times

00:25:03.218 --> 00:25:05.821
that apart from
a few people like you,

00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:08.027
everybody knows everything.

00:25:08.926 --> 00:25:11.940
I think I know as much
as everybody else does.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.710
Really?
- For instance

00:25:14.336 --> 00:25:16.604
you lost your parents when
you were very young.

00:25:17.298 --> 00:25:18.942
You grew up with your uncle,

00:25:19.661 --> 00:25:21.611
graduated from Bangabasi college,

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:23.971
worked in an office for some time

00:25:24.602 --> 00:25:27.749
and then made your first film
when you were 27.

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:33.226
You quickly found fame,
name, money and...

00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:37.688
And?
- You're still not married.

00:25:40.542 --> 00:25:41.701
Neither are you.

00:25:42.444 --> 00:25:46.497
Unless, you're one of those modern
women, who don't apply vermilion.

00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:48.290
No. I'm not married.

00:25:49.178 --> 00:25:50.178
But, you know,

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:52.779
what they're writing

00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:56.679
about you isn't very interesting.

00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:00.190
Really?

00:26:01.115 --> 00:26:04.312
What, according to you,
would be interesting?

00:26:05.174 --> 00:26:09.079
For instance, the first question
that comes to mind is,

00:26:10.511 --> 00:26:13.447
how does it clearly
feel to be so famous?

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.787
Feels fine. Splendid!

00:26:17.849 --> 00:26:18.858
But

00:26:19.846 --> 00:26:21.686
although, you have
everything in abundance,

00:26:21.925 --> 00:26:24.766
don't you feel there's some void,

00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:26.501
like something is missing?

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:28.301
Don't you have any regrets?

00:26:32.646 --> 00:26:33.994
Why do you want to know?

00:26:37.442 --> 00:26:38.667
What if I tell you everything

00:26:39.442 --> 00:26:41.073
and ruin my fan following?

00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:46.300
Look, Miss Sengupta,

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.291
it isn't good for
us to talk too much.

00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:52.329
We live in a world of shadows,

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:55.329
so it's best not to show the public

00:26:55.874 --> 00:27:00.254
too much of our flesh and blood.

00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:03.704
Do you understand?
I can see you don't.

00:27:04.218 --> 00:27:05.812
Perhaps, I do.
- What do you see?

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.893
That you must stay a hero

00:27:10.643 --> 00:27:13.276
in the eyes of the public.
- Exactly.

00:27:14.082 --> 00:27:16.261
So...
- So, there is nothing to discuss.

00:27:18.648 --> 00:27:21.399
So, goodbye. - Wait.
Let me offer you a cold drink,

00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:24.674
or you will tell your readers
that I have no manners.

00:27:25.281 --> 00:27:27.460
And even that might
hurt your fan following?

00:27:27.794 --> 00:27:30.487
Certainly! You know so little
about this business.

00:27:30.512 --> 00:27:34.717
All you do is watch films in
an air-conditioned room and say.

00:27:34.742 --> 00:27:35.904
Rubbish!
- True.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.149
But, I never realised that
your fan following was so fragile.

00:27:39.906 --> 00:27:42.139
Otherwise, I'd never
have bothered you.

00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:46.162
Miss Sengupta, you will
make progress in life.

00:27:46.571 --> 00:27:47.579
I hope so.

00:27:48.448 --> 00:27:51.234
But I'll have to put in
a lot of hard work.

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:53.538
And what about us?

00:27:53.878 --> 00:27:57.898
We just lean back in our cosy chairs
and rise to the top, right?

00:27:58.179 --> 00:27:59.529
Maybe! Goodbye.

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:02.117
And you don't want
anything cold to drink?

00:28:02.142 --> 00:28:03.543
No. Thank you.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.174
What happened? Did he tell
you anything? - No.

00:28:13.886 --> 00:28:15.817
Oh my! Why not?

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.066
Do you know what they remind me of?
There are some plants

00:28:20.425 --> 00:28:24.388
that you need to keep
in green houses, or they die.

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:26.476
He is just like that.

00:28:27.687 --> 00:28:28.688
Satisfied?

00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:45.019
What's your name?
- Rita.

00:28:45.344 --> 00:28:47.219
Is that so?
- And yours?

00:28:47.907 --> 00:28:50.094
My name is Arindam Mukherjee.

00:28:50.738 --> 00:28:51.738
Sir.

00:28:54.687 --> 00:28:57.231
Mr Aghore Chatterjee
would like a word with you.

00:28:57.994 --> 00:28:58.994
Again? Why?

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.965
It's about the piece about you
in the newspaper today.

00:29:03.965 --> 00:29:06.860
What piece?
- About you going to Delhi!

00:29:07.464 --> 00:29:09.266
I see.
- Yes. If you please...

00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:10.291
Okay.

00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:24.012
Did you want to see me?

00:29:24.437 --> 00:29:28.079
So, you're going to Delhi
to receive an award.

00:29:28.163 --> 00:29:32.007
Yes, but that's because they don't
know the inside stories about us.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:33.239
Come inside.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.364
May I come in?
- Sit down.

00:29:41.527 --> 00:29:43.205
I'm afraid.
- Afraid of what?

00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:46.219
I have all kinds of vices.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.607
What if you get some infection
or something?

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.841
What vices?

00:29:52.515 --> 00:29:56.099
It is never too late to reform.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.309
Have a chocolate?
- No, thanks.

00:30:00.726 --> 00:30:02.428
Do you have a family?
- No.

00:30:03.263 --> 00:30:04.528
Didn't you get married?

00:30:07.122 --> 00:30:09.751
Are you talking
about legal marriage?

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:11.920
What other kind of marriage is there

00:30:12.037 --> 00:30:13.774
in the civilised society?

00:30:16.168 --> 00:30:18.616
No, sir. Then I'm a bachelor.

00:30:19.286 --> 00:30:21.633
And why do you
have to take to drink?

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:23.833
What do you get by drinking?

00:30:25.413 --> 00:30:28.878
If you've never tried it,
how can I explain it to you?

00:30:29.753 --> 00:30:31.150
I'm no good with words,

00:30:32.656 --> 00:30:35.988
but I can act it out for you.
- Look here, young man!

00:30:36.955 --> 00:30:40.045
Without moral sense,
no one becomes great.

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:42.668
Especially today, in India,

00:30:42.956 --> 00:30:46.105
we need to be strict
about such things.

00:30:46.186 --> 00:30:47.350
Oh my God!

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.537
I'll go, sir.
I have to see about an injection.

00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:52.006
An injection?

00:30:54.263 --> 00:30:56.179
Cocaine!
- What nonsense!

00:30:57.207 --> 00:30:58.362
Scoundrel!

00:30:59.569 --> 00:31:02.293
Have some.
- No, mom. Not now!

00:31:02.436 --> 00:31:04.139
Come on, take it.

00:31:06.126 --> 00:31:07.164
Have it.

00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:19.423
I never thought I'd
see you so up close.

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:28.539
I saw you at New Market the other
day. You were buying a shirt.

00:31:32.212 --> 00:31:33.271
That's possible.

00:31:35.818 --> 00:31:39.898
You must have a lot of trouble
walking on the streets.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.445
Yes, that is true.

00:31:46.495 --> 00:31:47.495
Mom!

00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:55.417
What can you do here?
Where's the imagination?

00:31:56.307 --> 00:32:00.416
In England, you can spend hours
in front of a shop window.

00:32:00.913 --> 00:32:02.561
What superb displays!

00:32:02.586 --> 00:32:04.663
Sir, West Bengal
is still not like that.

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:08.401
How many people appreciate
what's good?

00:32:09.142 --> 00:32:13.295
If we got a client like you,
why wouldn't we do good things?

00:32:13.939 --> 00:32:15.189
You know what I mean.

00:32:15.798 --> 00:32:18.036
I just don't think you can do it.

00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:20.679
I'm very fussy...

00:32:23.646 --> 00:32:27.710
Oh, my wife. Mr Bose.
- Have a seat.

00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:31.377
What would you like?

00:32:32.245 --> 00:32:33.496
Waiter!

00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:38.025
Do you help your
husband in his work?

00:32:39.032 --> 00:32:40.557
She is the perfect housewife.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.248
I see.

00:32:44.897 --> 00:32:47.462
These days, young girls
are working in every field.

00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:49.844
I think it's a good idea.

00:32:52.502 --> 00:32:56.084
Besides, women have
a natural sense of beauty.

00:32:57.175 --> 00:33:00.554
I think that could be very useful
for the advertising profession.

00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:03.458
Have you ever thought
of that, Mr Sarkar?

00:33:04.245 --> 00:33:05.759
No, I can't say I have.

00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:08.984
Don't you want to work?

00:33:12.217 --> 00:33:14.006
You do!
- Yes, I do.

00:33:16.205 --> 00:33:19.441
But you can't dare to say that
to your husband, right?

00:33:24.874 --> 00:33:29.027
Nowadays, Bengali women are
hunting tigers, flying aeroplanes,

00:33:29.552 --> 00:33:32.679
climbing mountains,
becoming barristers.

00:33:33.015 --> 00:33:35.920
Why won't you be able to work in
an ordinary advertising agency?

00:33:36.258 --> 00:33:38.502
That doesn't even make sense.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.698
Mr Sarkar, what do you say?

00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:13.412
'Shankar! Shankar! Help!'

00:39:13.848 --> 00:39:15.272
'Help, Shankar!'

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.596
What's the matter?

00:40:34.087 --> 00:40:35.493
Move from the way.

00:40:44.161 --> 00:40:45.673
I'm sorry, madam.

00:41:07.138 --> 00:41:09.371
Why did you leave?

00:41:09.874 --> 00:41:10.878
I felt like it.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.533
You felt like it!

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.469
Without a word of explanation!

00:41:16.164 --> 00:41:18.092
Don't you know why I left?
- Why?

00:41:18.923 --> 00:41:20.885
Didn't you notice the way
he was staring at me?

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.014
That's not an...

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:26.870
What's wrong if the man like you?

00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:30.727
Molly, it's almost in the bag.

00:41:30.913 --> 00:41:33.646
I just need your help.
- My help?

00:41:33.913 --> 00:41:38.137
Weren't you listening? He gave us
his address, invited us to tea.

00:41:38.894 --> 00:41:39.894
What about it?

00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:42.649
Don't you understand?
- No. You tell me.

00:41:44.493 --> 00:41:46.718
Molly, you have been
a stage actress.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.743
Now you have to act a bit
in real life. - Acting?

00:41:50.461 --> 00:41:52.768
All you have to be
is a little nice to him.

00:41:53.848 --> 00:41:55.937
Give him some company.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.837
Smile sweetly, talk softly.

00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:00.270
I see.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.575
Won't you do that much
for your husband?

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.210
Please don't misunderstand me,
Molly! For heaven's sake!

00:42:07.413 --> 00:42:08.954
I don't like all this.

00:42:10.092 --> 00:42:11.912
Why are you taking
this so seriously?

00:42:12.117 --> 00:42:16.248
Molly, this a kind of game.
A strategy! - I understand.

00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:19.641
What happened? Where are you going?

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.379
Molly! Molly!

00:42:34.647 --> 00:42:36.960
Molly!

00:42:38.047 --> 00:42:39.997
Molly!

00:42:44.861 --> 00:42:47.178
Molly!

00:43:18.945 --> 00:43:20.891
Hot tea!

00:43:21.442 --> 00:43:22.448
Give me some tea!

00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:41.148
Hot tea!

00:43:42.817 --> 00:43:46.192
Hot tea!

00:43:47.921 --> 00:43:49.334
Hot tea!

00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:23.259
I'll be safe if I sit with you.

00:44:24.315 --> 00:44:26.715
You have no interest
in my profession.

00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:35.061
Tell me.

00:44:37.818 --> 00:44:39.869
Do you know anything about dreams?

00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:42.817
Dreams?
- Yes.

00:44:44.367 --> 00:44:46.931
I know the usual things,
like anybody else.

00:44:47.546 --> 00:44:48.587
What?

00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:52.989
It is said that all your
sub-conscious desires,

00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:57.260
beliefs and fears

00:44:58.567 --> 00:45:00.747
often constitute dreams.

00:45:04.886 --> 00:45:07.661
Did you fall asleep
and dream about something?

00:45:10.817 --> 00:45:12.001
Yes, I did.

00:45:13.467 --> 00:45:14.474
I saw

00:45:15.906 --> 00:45:18.312
that I was sinking
into a pile of money.

00:45:20.243 --> 00:45:22.127
Shankar could have pulled me out.

00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:24.790
But he didn't.

00:45:26.788 --> 00:45:27.791
And...

00:45:29.284 --> 00:45:30.518
I...

00:45:39.248 --> 00:45:40.954
It was terrible.

00:45:45.825 --> 00:45:46.922
Who is Shankar?

00:45:48.386 --> 00:45:49.401
Some relative?

00:45:51.005 --> 00:45:52.069
No, he is

00:45:52.757 --> 00:45:54.568
a friend from my neighbourhood.

00:45:55.607 --> 00:45:59.400
He used to say, 'Do anything else,
but don't join the cinema.'

00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:01.538
Old fashioned?

00:46:02.338 --> 00:46:04.967
Not really, except
when it came to films.

00:46:06.114 --> 00:46:08.860
But he had a reason for that.

00:46:10.144 --> 00:46:13.848
We had a club in the neighbourhood
that performed plays.

00:46:14.496 --> 00:46:19.405
Shankar was the leading light,
a real director.

00:46:20.121 --> 00:46:22.037
But I was always the hero.

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:27.533
And all the while, you were
secretly planning to go into films?

00:46:28.377 --> 00:46:29.480
I was egged on.

00:46:29.505 --> 00:46:32.307
There was a boy called Jyoti.
Well, he's still there, my manager.

00:46:32.669 --> 00:46:35.452
He had connections
with people in films.

00:46:36.121 --> 00:46:38.502
Then one day, Jyoti
came to me with an offer.

00:46:39.342 --> 00:46:41.038
A film on 'Devi Chaudhurani'.

00:46:41.438 --> 00:46:44.150
Mukunda Lahiri was to play the
father and that's what attracted me.

00:46:44.342 --> 00:46:45.464
It was Durga Puja

00:46:45.489 --> 00:46:47.476
and we were rehearsing
like mad for a play.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:50.925
It was then that somebody went

00:46:51.587 --> 00:46:53.075
and complained to Shankar about me.

00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:55.912
'No, no! I want the truth!'

00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:00.128
'What's going on?
Is it some kind of joke?'

00:47:04.303 --> 00:47:06.786
'Get out! Get out, all of you!'

00:47:11.494 --> 00:47:12.494
'What?'

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:15.681
'Are you trying
to sabotage my play?'

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.700
'What are you trying to do?'

00:47:19.883 --> 00:47:21.803
'You're losing your temper
for nothing, Shankar.'

00:47:21.833 --> 00:47:23.502
'I'll decide that.'

00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:29.221
'So, you want to become a film star!
Or a comet with a tail!'

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.228
'You know everything already.'

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.840
'But you didn't tell me anything.
I want to hear it from you.'

00:47:34.496 --> 00:47:38.138
'Jyoti brought a film offer.'

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.702
'What film?'

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.459
'Devi Chaudhurani.
- What role?'

00:47:44.139 --> 00:47:45.141
'The lead role.'

00:47:45.825 --> 00:47:47.940
'Brajeshwar! That nonentity!'

00:47:48.506 --> 00:47:52.115
'Nothing is decided yet.
They just want a screen test.'

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:56.754
'What did you say?
- I haven't said anything yet.'

00:47:58.598 --> 00:47:59.712
'I'll tell you.'

00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:02.087
'You can't do it.'

00:48:02.837 --> 00:48:04.263
'I won't if you don't agree.'

00:48:05.138 --> 00:48:08.200
'Although, I wasn't planning on
jeopardising the play for the film.'

00:48:11.533 --> 00:48:12.930
'Listen, Arindam.'

00:48:13.496 --> 00:48:15.216
'I know there's a lot
of glamour in films, '

00:48:16.246 --> 00:48:19.474
'but they have no
connection with art.'

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.983
'An actor in films'

00:48:24.008 --> 00:48:27.872
'don't have an important
contribution. Impossible!'

00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:30.319
'I know this for certain.'

00:48:30.895 --> 00:48:32.597
'I've done a detailed study of it.'

00:48:37.497 --> 00:48:40.556
'A film actor is
nothing but a puppet.'

00:48:41.363 --> 00:48:42.479
'A doll.'

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.770
'A puppet in the
hands of the director, '

00:48:45.377 --> 00:48:47.017
'a puppet in the hands
of the cameraman, '

00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:49.254
'and the sound recordist.'

00:48:50.455 --> 00:48:53.061
'And the person, who edits
the film into its final form...'

00:48:53.211 --> 00:48:54.331
'A puppet in his hands too!'

00:48:56.529 --> 00:48:57.690
'And there's one more thing.'

00:48:58.119 --> 00:49:02.002
'The main source of inspiration
for an actor are the spectators.'

00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:08.391
'All those dark heads you see,
they give you the energy.'

00:49:08.908 --> 00:49:11.771
'You draw inspiration from them.
If you take that away, '

00:49:12.258 --> 00:49:15.048
'where's the real thrill of acting?

00:49:15.898 --> 00:49:17.154
'Is it there in films?'

00:49:19.413 --> 00:49:22.003
'What are you actually
looking for? Money?'

00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:26.250
'I'm not saying
that you won't be successful.'

00:49:26.925 --> 00:49:30.462
'You've got the looks, the voice,
you may become successful.'

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.912
'But there's one thing
you must know.'

00:49:41.958 --> 00:49:46.046
'There's a nasty side to films,
the business side, '

00:49:47.183 --> 00:49:49.334
'nothing but supply and demand.'

00:49:50.475 --> 00:49:54.696
'You have two hits in a row and
you'll find yourself at the top.'

00:49:55.413 --> 00:49:59.059
'Then when number three flops
and number four flops, '

00:49:59.765 --> 00:50:05.353
'you'll find the ladder you
climbed up has been taken away.'

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.628
'Then somebody gives you a push'

00:50:08.246 --> 00:50:11.948
'and you fall smack on your face.'

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.919
'Then you're finished
for all times.'

00:50:18.992 --> 00:50:21.847
That's who Shankar was.

00:50:23.797 --> 00:50:28.383
And he wasn't completely
wrong, either.

00:50:30.746 --> 00:50:33.868
But it doesn't apply
in your case, does it?

00:50:39.096 --> 00:50:43.186
On 'Ashtami' during Durga Puja
that year, we performed the play.

00:50:44.518 --> 00:50:48.960
Two days later, we were to
immerse the idol of the Goddess.

00:50:50.062 --> 00:50:53.603
Our image was
in the traditional style.

00:50:53.777 --> 00:50:57.133
Shankar used to say that
without proper decoration

00:50:57.623 --> 00:51:00.511
and those huge eyes,
one doesn't have the right feeling.

00:51:02.139 --> 00:51:05.036
'Glory to Goddess Durga!'

00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:07.267
'Glory to Goddess Durga!'

00:51:10.433 --> 00:51:14.056
'Move! Shankar!'

00:51:14.914 --> 00:51:16.843
'Shankar!'

00:51:17.663 --> 00:51:18.744
'Shankar!'

00:51:19.771 --> 00:51:21.718
'He is no more.'

00:51:27.301 --> 00:51:28.894
That young man

00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:30.912
dropped dead before my eyes.

00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:33.131
Thrombosis.

00:51:36.623 --> 00:51:38.490
I saw both my parents
die while I was a child.

00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:42.078
I had carried many dead bodies
of relatives and others.

00:51:43.353 --> 00:51:48.055
It had made me kind of
callous about death.

00:51:49.261 --> 00:51:52.395
But I wasn't able
to accept Shankar's death.

00:51:53.246 --> 00:51:55.111
He was so full of life!

00:51:56.019 --> 00:51:59.713
How could he die so suddenly?

00:52:02.205 --> 00:52:03.647
But do you know what's strange?

00:52:03.837 --> 00:52:07.063
When the dead body
was being cremated,

00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:12.935
I felt as if something was...
Something was changing within me.

00:52:13.561 --> 00:52:14.684
'Jyoti.'

00:52:15.956 --> 00:52:16.997
'Yes?'

00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:18.954
'Sit.'

00:52:21.182 --> 00:52:22.182
'What?'

00:52:22.455 --> 00:52:25.430
'Do you believe in reincarnation?
- Whose reincarnation?'

00:52:25.955 --> 00:52:28.661
'Human rebirth.
Yours, for instance.'

00:52:29.439 --> 00:52:32.230
'Even if I'm reborn, how
do I know it's me?'

00:52:32.538 --> 00:52:35.286
'Jyoti Banerjee won't be reborn
as Jyoti Banerjee.'

00:52:35.538 --> 00:52:37.492
'Not many can remember
their previous lives anyway.'

00:52:37.516 --> 00:52:40.221
'So, it's not about believing
or not believing.'

00:52:45.045 --> 00:52:48.135
'Exactly! - This is the age
of Marx and Freud.'

00:52:49.052 --> 00:52:52.085
'No rebirth, no providence.'

00:52:52.288 --> 00:52:56.704
'I know. One life, one chance...'

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.619
'What's on your mind?'

00:53:00.466 --> 00:53:01.501
'What are you thinking?'

00:53:03.064 --> 00:53:07.298
'Do you also believe
that film actors are all puppets?'

00:53:07.621 --> 00:53:13.244
'Brando, Bogart, Paul Muni...
Are they all puppets?'

00:53:14.981 --> 00:53:18.284
'As a man, you earn
350 rupees a month, '

00:53:18.809 --> 00:53:20.507
'with an annual
increment of ten rupees.'

00:53:21.638 --> 00:53:28.407
'But as a successful puppet,
you get 30,000 rupees per film.'

00:53:31.973 --> 00:53:35.483
'They've tested two boys,
but haven't taken them.'

00:53:40.404 --> 00:53:44.643
'No, Shankar must be wrong.
Must be wrong!'

00:53:46.525 --> 00:53:49.018
'If you agree,
I won't feel humiliated.'

00:53:55.594 --> 00:53:57.483
'If it was ancient times,
I'd be afraid.'

00:53:58.014 --> 00:53:59.022
'Afraid of what?'

00:54:02.775 --> 00:54:04.259
'Shankar's curse.'

00:54:08.273 --> 00:54:11.229
I decided then, on the spot.

00:54:21.183 --> 00:54:22.184
Wow!

00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:25.249
You look beautiful
without your glasses.

00:54:30.748 --> 00:54:32.499
You must be
a bit scared by all this.

00:54:33.205 --> 00:54:34.205
Why?

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:37.667
Right after his death, I...

00:54:39.996 --> 00:54:41.704
Well, that's real life for you.

00:54:43.038 --> 00:54:45.198
That's what Bengali films
don't have, according to you.

00:54:47.807 --> 00:54:48.809
Bardhaman.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.049
Perhaps, I shouldn't stay here.

00:55:08.189 --> 00:55:09.679
Why not?

00:55:12.062 --> 00:55:16.243
Well, at the station...
Look, they've recognised you.

00:55:17.715 --> 00:55:19.138
Is that so strange?

00:55:19.701 --> 00:55:21.482
No, but... again! Oh my God!

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.889
You know,
it's a red-letter day for them.

00:55:25.546 --> 00:55:26.550
I know.

00:55:27.006 --> 00:55:28.572
But I'm not used to all this.

00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:31.932
Do you know what they're thinking?

00:55:33.393 --> 00:55:38.125
They think that I'm shooting a film
and you're my co-actor. - Oh no!

00:55:38.981 --> 00:55:40.036
What are you saying?

00:55:40.106 --> 00:55:42.642
Why? Are you ashamed of my company?

00:55:43.188 --> 00:55:44.546
That is not it.

00:55:50.861 --> 00:55:53.969
Take the hand away from your face,
or they'll bother you more.

00:55:53.994 --> 00:55:56.617
Relax! Be normal!

00:55:57.017 --> 00:55:58.867
Keep talking.
- Impossible.

00:55:59.802 --> 00:56:01.657
Then, may I talk?
- Go on.

00:56:05.256 --> 00:56:06.580
Why haven't you got married?

00:56:09.843 --> 00:56:11.337
Have you ever done any acting?

00:56:13.674 --> 00:56:15.193
Would you like to go into films?

00:56:16.182 --> 00:56:17.182
You...

00:56:17.683 --> 00:56:19.024
Let me ask the questions.

00:56:20.038 --> 00:56:21.047
Go on.

00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:22.762
Do you...

00:56:24.507 --> 00:56:26.353
Do you remember
your first day's shooting?

00:56:30.538 --> 00:56:31.545
Who ever

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:34.477
forgets it?

00:56:37.746 --> 00:56:39.275
The one I am reminded of the most

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.374
is Mukunda Lahiri.

00:56:48.455 --> 00:56:50.078
'Who is it there?'

00:56:50.752 --> 00:56:53.054
'My name is Arindam Mukhopadhyay.'

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:56.283
'Oh! So you'll play Brajeshwar!'

00:56:56.767 --> 00:56:57.771
'Yes, sir.'

00:56:58.808 --> 00:57:01.500
'Is this your first film?
- Yes, sir.'

00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:07.825
'Do you mind if I call
you Brajeshwar? - No.'

00:57:09.788 --> 00:57:14.517
'It's a habit to call my co-actors
by their character names.'

00:57:14.954 --> 00:57:15.960
'I see.'

00:57:16.804 --> 00:57:18.644
'I think you'll find it
helpful because, '

00:57:19.706 --> 00:57:22.698
'when we do a scene, '

00:57:23.923 --> 00:57:27.388
'reactions will come more
naturally. - I understand.'

00:57:30.356 --> 00:57:34.232
'But don't you call me father.'

00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:36.698
'That'll be a bit too much.'

00:57:37.096 --> 00:57:38.098
'Okay?'

00:57:38.671 --> 00:57:41.982
'And smoking in front of me...
Hey! Idiot!'

00:57:42.151 --> 00:57:45.984
'You do that again and I'll
tear off your real moustache!'

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.786
'Did it hurt?
- Stiff neck.'

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:51.681
'I told the servant
to put the pillows in the sun.'

00:57:51.817 --> 00:57:53.245
'Would you like a massage?'

00:57:53.807 --> 00:57:56.107
'Massage?
- It'll get rid of your pain.'

00:57:58.968 --> 00:58:00.772
'Jack of all trades!'

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.653
'Not quite.
But this is one of them.'

00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:07.782
'How long will it take?
- Not long.'

00:58:08.532 --> 00:58:11.244
'Come on, we'll try the massage.'

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:15.738
I learnt it from Shankar.
It never failed.

00:58:31.163 --> 00:58:33.602
During the shooting,
I witnessed his terror.

00:58:34.246 --> 00:58:39.079
Everyone, including the director,
was scared of him.

00:58:39.321 --> 00:58:43.168
'Why is it so hot?
Who is standing before the fan?'

00:58:44.939 --> 00:58:46.399
'Remember, '

00:58:47.663 --> 00:58:52.424
'the actor is the only
indispensable person on the set.'

00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:57.257
'No one can replace him.'

00:58:57.807 --> 00:59:00.340
'There you are! Pick it up.'

00:59:00.663 --> 00:59:01.752
'Where's Brajeshwar?'

00:59:02.178 --> 00:59:03.946
'Brajeshwar!
- Here, sir.'

00:59:07.942 --> 00:59:09.069
'Listen, '

00:59:10.544 --> 00:59:12.803
'I don't learn lines
as they are written.'

00:59:13.909 --> 00:59:18.204
'Sometimes, I improvise, as
long as the sense remains the same.'

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:22.994
'You will have to watch
for the cues.'

00:59:23.125 --> 00:59:25.829
'Right, sir.
- Come on, let's start. One minute.'

00:59:27.107 --> 00:59:29.203
'This is your first position.
- Okay.'

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:32.994
'When I say action, you'll move
forward and address your father.'

00:59:33.215 --> 00:59:35.203
'Then he will react.
- Right.'

00:59:35.288 --> 00:59:37.688
'After that, you stand on the
chalk mark and touch his feet.'

00:59:37.871 --> 00:59:39.786
'Then you'll talk. Okay?'

00:59:39.811 --> 00:59:41.965
'Yes.
- Action. Monitor.'

00:59:42.022 --> 00:59:43.647
'Monitor! Come on!'

00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.356
'Sounds on!'

00:59:53.672 --> 00:59:54.736
'Ready, Mukunda?'

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.853
'Action!'

01:00:05.024 --> 01:00:06.032
'Father.'

01:00:08.283 --> 01:00:09.295
'Come in.'

01:00:14.371 --> 01:00:17.717
'Your delay was causing me
great anxiety.'

01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:21.377
'I had never imagined'

01:00:22.158 --> 01:00:24.865
'that in my old age, '

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:28.229
'I would face such tribulation.'

01:00:30.054 --> 01:00:34.959
'I can find no fault
with my actions.'

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:39.168
'I've thought a lot about it, '

01:00:40.268 --> 01:00:44.273
'but can't think of anything wrong
that I've done.'

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:47.004
'So, '

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:50.116
'how do I explain it'

01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:52.340
'if not as the fate mocking me?'

01:00:54.161 --> 01:00:56.481
'I suppose you know that
through the grace of Teri Singh, '

01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:01.210
'a warrant has been
issued for my arrest.'

01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:02.999
'I know.'

01:01:03.598 --> 01:01:05.344
'So, you realise, '

01:01:05.369 --> 01:01:10.185
'that money is
now the most pressing need.'

01:01:11.577 --> 01:01:15.319
'Have you done anything about it?'

01:01:16.937 --> 01:01:19.912
'Father-in-law won't
give anything, '

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:22.647
'but I've found another way.'

01:01:23.616 --> 01:01:25.082
'Is that a special style'

01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:28.143
'or is it copied from Hollywood?'

01:01:30.227 --> 01:01:31.387
'What are you muttering for?'

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.402
'Doesn't the situation'

01:01:34.052 --> 01:01:36.869
'call for a low voice?
- Low voice?'

01:01:38.356 --> 01:01:40.787
'Bankim wrote that in those days,
young men didn't raise'

01:01:41.537 --> 01:01:43.137
'their voices
in front of their fathers.'

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:46.389
'Maybe. But your way of speaking
must go with mine.'

01:01:47.298 --> 01:01:50.405
'If we speak in absolutely different
manners, how will they mix?'

01:01:51.352 --> 01:01:53.685
'You cannot ignore
voice modulations.'

01:01:54.383 --> 01:01:57.008
'You have worked on stage.
Haven't you learnt voice...'

01:01:57.070 --> 01:02:02.326
He didn't even hesitate to insult me
before so many people.

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:06.466
But he was a senior actor,
so I kept quiet.

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:11.920
Although, I knew that his style
of acting was wrong.

01:02:12.689 --> 01:02:16.758
It was old style.
It didn't work in modern times.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.242
Wow! You had
so much confidence even then!

01:02:22.154 --> 01:02:24.037
I had, but...

01:02:25.931 --> 01:02:28.643
I felt something was wrong
before the film was released.

01:02:32.344 --> 01:02:33.385
Wrong?

01:02:34.205 --> 01:02:35.751
Before then,

01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:39.153
I didn't have any bad habits.

01:02:40.471 --> 01:02:41.471
But

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.259
that day...

01:02:52.121 --> 01:02:53.125
'Here.'

01:02:54.231 --> 01:02:56.229
'Take it.
It will steady your nerves.'

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.416
'You know what?
- What?'

01:03:23.955 --> 01:03:25.251
'There's a reason'

01:03:27.139 --> 01:03:28.313
'for my nervousness.'

01:03:28.982 --> 01:03:31.833
'Don't I know it!
The film will release tomorrow.'

01:03:36.163 --> 01:03:37.167
'Then?'

01:03:40.663 --> 01:03:41.750
'My work is'

01:03:43.394 --> 01:03:44.394
'not good.'

01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:46.187
'Not good?'

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.329
'Wrong! Too many things went wrong.'

01:03:54.223 --> 01:03:57.229
'Haven't I seen the film?
Doesn't my opinion count?'

01:03:58.405 --> 01:03:59.586
'No, it doesn't.'

01:04:01.048 --> 01:04:03.287
'It is worth nothing.
- Nothing?'

01:04:04.663 --> 01:04:05.665
'Nothing!'

01:04:07.015 --> 01:04:09.018
'You don't understand.
You don't know.'

01:04:09.974 --> 01:04:11.406
'No one but me knows.'

01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:14.133
'An actor'

01:04:16.104 --> 01:04:17.110
'knows.'

01:04:17.455 --> 01:04:20.821
'When I was performing,
I felt I was going wrong.'

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:25.395
'The fault is not mine.'

01:04:26.793 --> 01:04:28.858
'And yet, in some way, it is.'

01:04:31.013 --> 01:04:33.419
'You don't understand.
You're blind.'

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:36.544
'All my scenes with Mukunda Lahiri
were spoiled.'

01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:38.745
'But that's only four scenes.'

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.476
'In the entire movie,
just four scenes!'

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:43.778
'But why even four?'

01:04:45.584 --> 01:04:47.560
'It could have been perfect,
my first film.'

01:04:48.163 --> 01:04:49.272
'But that man...'

01:04:51.085 --> 01:04:52.714
'That man tried to trip me over.'

01:04:55.212 --> 01:04:56.569
'You're being too fussy.'

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:00.196
'Do you know why he did that?'

01:05:02.054 --> 01:05:04.662
'He would've been caught
in the wrong otherwise.'

01:05:06.356 --> 01:05:09.883
'He had understood
that I had prepared for my role.'

01:05:11.746 --> 01:05:12.751
'And he couldn't'

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.443
'tolerate that.'

01:05:17.076 --> 01:05:18.978
'Do you know how these people are?'

01:05:19.428 --> 01:05:21.414
'They don't care about
the characters they play.'

01:05:21.663 --> 01:05:25.031
'Give him any part and he churns out
the same character.'

01:05:25.427 --> 01:05:28.583
'The same voice, same style
of acting, same mannerisms.'

01:05:29.913 --> 01:05:31.982
'And the public just laps it up.'

01:05:32.883 --> 01:05:36.062
'Mukunda Lahiri! What acting!
What a voice!'

01:05:36.363 --> 01:05:37.462
'No, no, no!'

01:05:38.496 --> 01:05:42.619
'This isn't right. Loud acting
doesn't work in front of camera.'

01:05:42.768 --> 01:05:45.088
'You overdo it just a bit
and it comes out 10 times worse.'

01:05:48.455 --> 01:05:52.486
'My style of acting would
have shown up his weaknesses.'

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:55.566
'He could see that.
And because I was new, '

01:05:55.923 --> 01:05:58.904
'he could shout at me
and shut me up.'

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:01.781
'Okay.'

01:06:05.871 --> 01:06:10.596
'Arindam, it's a good sign
that you're being so fastidious.'

01:06:11.154 --> 01:06:12.596
'It means you'll go a long way.'

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:17.057
'I will. I'll make sure of that.

01:06:18.063 --> 01:06:20.226
'I will go to the top!'

01:06:20.557 --> 01:06:22.520
'The top!'

01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:25.532
I went to see the first
showing of the film,

01:06:25.955 --> 01:06:26.955
and you know,

01:06:28.773 --> 01:06:32.153
I couldn't stand more
than half of it.

01:06:32.978 --> 01:06:35.597
But do you know how many autographs
I signed afterwards?

01:06:37.271 --> 01:06:39.225
Feels good, doesn't it?
- Marvellous!

01:06:43.112 --> 01:06:44.114
But tell me,

01:06:45.352 --> 01:06:47.686
up to now, haven't
any of your films...

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:52.945
Been a flop, you mean?
- Yes.

01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:56.776
No. Not yet.

01:06:59.757 --> 01:07:01.161
Then, what were you sighing about?

01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:05.822
You see, I know what can happen
if three films flop in a row.

01:07:07.339 --> 01:07:08.434
Who did it happen to?

01:07:11.431 --> 01:07:13.125
One day, three to four years ago,

01:07:13.861 --> 01:07:16.076
I was already famous.
I had just moved into my new house.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.240
11 o'clock at night,
I was going to

01:07:18.252 --> 01:07:20.403
bed, we were shooting
the next day.

01:07:20.908 --> 01:07:24.544
Suddenly, the butler informed me,
a gentleman wanted to see me.

01:07:25.086 --> 01:07:27.146
Very urgent.

01:07:28.384 --> 01:07:29.390
So I went.

01:07:36.445 --> 01:07:37.603
'Remember me?'

01:07:41.022 --> 01:07:42.343
'What are you saying, Mukunda?'

01:07:43.913 --> 01:07:45.246
'A lot of people'

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:47.978
'have forgotten me.'

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.738
'Well?'

01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.378
'Won't you offer me'

01:08:00.628 --> 01:08:02.028
'some of your...'

01:08:02.684 --> 01:08:03.787
'Ramsharan.'

01:08:05.017 --> 01:08:06.021
'Yes, sir?'

01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:08.820
'What will you have?'

01:08:09.101 --> 01:08:10.387
'I don't want anything.'

01:08:11.875 --> 01:08:13.111
'My soul does.'

01:08:13.981 --> 01:08:15.379
'What will your soul have?'

01:08:16.248 --> 01:08:17.254
'Whisky?'

01:08:19.665 --> 01:08:20.665
'Whisky.'

01:08:25.931 --> 01:08:27.073
'What about you?'

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.037
'I've got a shoot tomorrow.'

01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:32.248
'A shoot.'

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:35.150
'The word has a'

01:08:37.705 --> 01:08:38.852
'familiar ring.'

01:08:40.914 --> 01:08:42.645
'The hero...'

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:44.870
'Time to change.'

01:08:51.593 --> 01:08:52.977
'My first film.'

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.501
'Kapal Kundala.'

01:09:01.614 --> 01:09:05.164
'At first, I couldn't get my grip.'

01:09:06.608 --> 01:09:09.217
'Then came the talkies.'

01:09:11.464 --> 01:09:12.483
'Voice!'

01:09:15.222 --> 01:09:17.728
'I went to the summit.'

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:23.697
'Twenty years!'

01:09:26.113 --> 01:09:27.121
'Then, '

01:09:28.353 --> 01:09:29.826
'one day suddenly, '

01:09:32.508 --> 01:09:33.523
'I felt myself slipping.'

01:09:35.386 --> 01:09:36.392
'Slipping...'

01:09:38.585 --> 01:09:41.488
'I never understood
how it happened.'

01:09:44.838 --> 01:09:45.917
'Then I noticed, '

01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:49.109
'the throne is there.'

01:09:51.552 --> 01:09:53.450
'I have been overthrown.'

01:10:02.325 --> 01:10:03.694
'What are you working on now?'

01:10:06.374 --> 01:10:07.408
'The usual.'

01:10:08.423 --> 01:10:09.460
'Good whisky.'

01:10:11.943 --> 01:10:15.187
'Is the casting done?'

01:10:16.544 --> 01:10:17.558
'I don't know.'

01:10:18.577 --> 01:10:21.183
'Your word counts these days.'

01:10:21.683 --> 01:10:23.765
'Couldn't you find me anything?'

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.214
'Doorman... Anything!'

01:10:27.889 --> 01:10:30.520
'You could, couldn't you?'

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:39.528
'Such stagnation!'

01:10:43.044 --> 01:10:44.075
'I...'

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:48.798
'Four years, no work!'

01:10:52.528 --> 01:10:53.528
'I had two policies.'

01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:56.416
'Both lapsed.'

01:10:58.316 --> 01:10:59.797
'Will you be able to work?'

01:11:01.899 --> 01:11:03.755
'You don't look too well, Mukunda.'

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:06.665
'Voice!'

01:11:08.315 --> 01:11:09.321
'Voice...'

01:11:12.473 --> 01:11:15.532
'Just voice isn't enough.
You know that.'

01:11:19.496 --> 01:11:21.436
'So, isn't it true'

01:11:23.523 --> 01:11:26.031
'that men improve with age?'

01:12:01.353 --> 01:12:02.869
Did you help him get a role?

01:12:03.522 --> 01:12:04.684
How could I?

01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:09.446
The man took morphine all day.
How would he have acted?

01:12:10.749 --> 01:12:13.772
So, you had your revenge in the end.

01:12:15.878 --> 01:12:19.252
Could you forget
how he behaved on that first day?

01:12:25.121 --> 01:12:26.122
Wow!

01:12:27.703 --> 01:12:29.477
I see you're quite a
formidable young lady.

01:12:35.205 --> 01:12:37.701
The scenery has changed
after we crossed the Bengal border.

01:12:38.476 --> 01:12:40.894
Everything is dry in this part.

01:12:41.492 --> 01:12:43.001
Just like you.

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:45.832
Like me?

01:12:47.482 --> 01:12:50.203
Aren't you hard too?
Hard and ruthless?

01:12:50.848 --> 01:12:54.103
Didn't you sweep aside
everything that got in your way?

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:56.795
You know,

01:12:59.732 --> 01:13:05.715
the voice of conscience in plays?
That's the role for you.

01:13:07.667 --> 01:13:09.039
Is that bad?

01:13:11.789 --> 01:13:15.454
No, but a terrible nuisance.

01:13:16.279 --> 01:13:18.862
I wish I could sweep it away...
- What are you saying?

01:13:19.405 --> 01:13:22.874
Isn't that what makes you human?

01:13:25.643 --> 01:13:26.645
Yes, but...

01:13:27.874 --> 01:13:29.532
Do you know what's worse?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.370
When people very close to you...

01:13:35.393 --> 01:13:38.001
For example, Biresh...

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:44.343
Biresh and I studied together
for 10 years.

01:13:45.036 --> 01:13:47.034
We went to the same school
and college.

01:13:47.496 --> 01:13:49.637
He was in politics
and I was unemployed.

01:13:50.068 --> 01:13:51.437
So, I used to accompany him.

01:13:51.955 --> 01:13:55.164
'The company
is exploiting workers...'

01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:57.864
Biresh would deliver speeches
in front of the factory gates

01:13:57.889 --> 01:14:00.792
and I would stand away from him

01:14:00.817 --> 01:14:03.866
and memorise the dialogues
of my next play.

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.303
They were happy days
we had together.

01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:07.966
'Do you know why I bring you here?'

01:14:09.191 --> 01:14:11.603
'You bring me!
I come here because I want to.'

01:14:11.746 --> 01:14:14.424
'Right, but being here
isn't enough.'

01:14:14.996 --> 01:14:18.842
'I want you to be conscious
about a few things.'

01:14:19.328 --> 01:14:20.644
'The trouble with you'

01:14:20.996 --> 01:14:23.323
'is that your plays and theatre'

01:14:23.348 --> 01:14:25.484
'keep you in a world
of make-believe'

01:14:25.787 --> 01:14:28.793
'that doesn't allow you to know
the real world.'

01:14:29.052 --> 01:14:30.737
'Is that so?
- Yes.'

01:14:31.412 --> 01:14:35.539
'If you could feel these issues,
it would be better.'

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.093
'What do you mean by better?'

01:14:37.455 --> 01:14:41.837
'With your voice and personality,
if you could stand up and speak...'

01:14:41.886 --> 01:14:43.703
'In front of the factory gate?
- Yes.'

01:14:44.327 --> 01:14:48.450
'And you'd be a labour leader on
the stage. So, you'd be acting too.'

01:14:49.514 --> 01:14:51.070
'The play would be ruined.'

01:14:53.052 --> 01:14:55.787
'The company has fired
people illegally.'

01:14:56.026 --> 01:14:59.163
'As long as it doesn't
reinstate workers, '

01:14:59.308 --> 01:15:02.860
'we will...'
- Once, during a strike,

01:15:03.647 --> 01:15:07.849
Biresh was giving his usual speech
and I was pacing nearby.

01:15:08.031 --> 01:15:12.893
'Long live the worker's strike!'

01:15:13.017 --> 01:15:15.920
'Long live revolution!'

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.809
Suddenly, I heard something and
turned to see a group of people,

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:23.460
obviously, hired to cause damage,
were walking towards the meeting.

01:15:24.242 --> 01:15:26.260
A police van was right behind them.

01:15:27.154 --> 01:15:28.892
I knew that a chaos
was going to ensue.

01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:32.592
Usually, I don't like chaos.

01:15:33.294 --> 01:15:36.733
'Catch a fish without getting
your hands wet, ' That's my motto.

01:15:36.758 --> 01:15:39.181
But I don't know
what happened that day.

01:15:40.408 --> 01:15:44.491
I jumped into the crowd
because Biresh was in trouble.

01:15:45.828 --> 01:15:49.376
But then I was hit
on my head by a stone.

01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:52.244
Then there was a blackout!

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.815
Later, I found out
that Biresh was arrested.

01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:57.846
There was no clue
of him for 5 years.

01:15:58.709 --> 01:16:00.252
Meanwhile, I started
working in films

01:16:00.587 --> 01:16:03.071
and made a name for myself.
I even bought a flat in Ballygunge.

01:16:03.705 --> 01:16:05.012
It was a Sunday morning.

01:16:05.037 --> 01:16:08.338
A new film was about to be shot.
The tailor was taking measurements.

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:11.118
'He weaves stories.
- What's new?'

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.508
'The story of a few films...'

01:16:14.565 --> 01:16:15.640
'Yes!'

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:17.994
'When is the fitting?
- Wednesday evening.'

01:16:18.135 --> 01:16:19.953
'Why Wednesday?
Two days earlier...'

01:16:20.037 --> 01:16:21.041
'Who's that?'

01:16:23.493 --> 01:16:24.499
'Hey!'

01:16:26.205 --> 01:16:26.951
'Busy?'

01:16:26.976 --> 01:16:30.099
'No, not at all!
Come in and have a seat.'

01:16:30.456 --> 01:16:33.163
'Wait a minute. What should we do?
- Talk to him.'

01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:36.979
'If the clothes don't fit,
my acting suffers a lot.'

01:16:37.011 --> 01:16:40.357
'Don't worry. They'll fit.
- You can't work in Hindi films.'

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:42.482
'Go and wait
in the other room for a while.'

01:16:50.632 --> 01:16:52.494
'All right. What now?'

01:16:52.845 --> 01:16:54.576
'One more near the window...'

01:16:54.998 --> 01:16:56.151
'Come on, hurry up!'

01:16:56.907 --> 01:16:59.150
'Just turn, I want a profile.
- Take it.'

01:17:03.893 --> 01:17:05.529
'Finished? Now leave.'

01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:08.266
'It's all right. Go now.'

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:10.035
'Come here.'

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:12.664
'Jyoti, send a cup of tea in here.'

01:17:13.077 --> 01:17:14.081
'Come here and sit.'

01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:17.092
'Are these photos for your fans?
- What can I say?'

01:17:17.537 --> 01:17:20.123
'I can't displease them.
They're my public, after all.'

01:17:21.258 --> 01:17:22.317
'So, tell me.'

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:23.963
'How have you been?'

01:17:24.623 --> 01:17:25.627
'A cigarette?'

01:17:27.123 --> 01:17:28.328
'How long has it been?'

01:17:29.079 --> 01:17:31.547
'Almost five years, right?'

01:17:35.443 --> 01:17:36.448
'What?'

01:17:40.215 --> 01:17:42.876
'You've acquired
a kind of radiance.'

01:17:45.584 --> 01:17:47.078
'The glow of success!'

01:17:47.516 --> 01:17:48.812
'Who doesn't want success?'

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.203
'I haven't seen any of your films.
- You haven't missed much.'

01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:57.873
'You must be doing well.
- How about you?'

01:17:58.823 --> 01:17:59.894
'Same as always.'

01:18:00.399 --> 01:18:01.411
'No change?'

01:18:03.123 --> 01:18:04.614
'But you seem to be...'

01:18:05.852 --> 01:18:06.858
'Different?'

01:18:07.574 --> 01:18:08.577
'It seems so.'

01:18:09.505 --> 01:18:13.038
'Change is the only
constant in the world.'

01:18:13.932 --> 01:18:14.938
'Right?'

01:18:15.095 --> 01:18:17.969
'But I'm not sure about
the direction of the change.'

01:18:21.234 --> 01:18:24.694
'How does it matter?
Come, have some tea.'

01:18:32.729 --> 01:18:34.009
'You have a car now, don't you?'

01:18:34.806 --> 01:18:36.556
'A small car, not big.'

01:18:38.155 --> 01:18:40.471
'Why?
- Can you give me a ride?'

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:41.952
'Where to?'

01:18:44.773 --> 01:18:46.533
'You never used to ask
that question before.'

01:18:50.787 --> 01:18:51.862
'All right.'

01:19:02.555 --> 01:19:05.873
Even in the car, Biresh didn't
tell me where he was taking me.

01:19:06.505 --> 01:19:07.879
And I didn't ask.

01:19:08.364 --> 01:19:12.422
But after a few kilometres,
doubt formed in my mind.

01:19:14.203 --> 01:19:18.136
After a few moments, I realised
that I wasn't completely wrong.

01:19:18.172 --> 01:19:20.666
'Stop right here.'

01:19:27.608 --> 01:19:31.145
'Long live Arindam Mukherjee!'

01:19:31.181 --> 01:19:34.137
'Long live Arindam Mukherjee!'

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.661
'Come out.'

01:19:36.232 --> 01:19:38.287
'What happened?
- What are you planning?'

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:43.395
'Nothing. Just get down, stand in
front of them and say a few words.'

01:19:43.939 --> 01:19:47.484
'Why?
- It'll cheer them up to see you.'

01:19:47.877 --> 01:19:49.352
'They've been on strike
for 24 days.'

01:19:49.502 --> 01:19:53.750
'They've been expecting you.
They're also your public.'

01:19:54.097 --> 01:19:56.703
'Impossible! - What do you
mean impossible? Come on.'

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.494
'You don't get it! I can't be
involved in this. It's too risky.'

01:20:01.871 --> 01:20:04.346
'Why can't you
understand my position?'

01:20:04.703 --> 01:20:06.975
'Nonsense! What on earth
are you so afraid of?'

01:20:07.494 --> 01:20:10.107
'If you want money, I can
give it to you. Any amount!'

01:20:10.215 --> 01:20:14.227
'But this is impossible. Don't you
know I'm not what I used to be?'

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:17.940
'I can see you're not what you
used to be. - I just... I can't.'

01:20:17.965 --> 01:20:20.089
'Don't you have any feelings
for these people?'

01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:22.420
'How do feelings come into it?'

01:20:22.455 --> 01:20:23.882
'I'm telling you,
if you want money,

01:20:23.894 --> 01:20:25.216
I'll give it to you.
Any amount!'

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:28.392
'Anonymously, right?

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:32.537
'I know you have a lot of money.'

01:20:33.027 --> 01:20:36.224
'Okay, I'll see you again if needed.
- I'm leaving.'

01:20:44.104 --> 01:20:46.736
I couldn't do what Biresh wanted.

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.688
Why I couldn't...

01:20:49.214 --> 01:20:52.227
What was I afraid of...
I can't really say.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.971
But I understood that Biresh
didn't respect me anymore.

01:21:02.089 --> 01:21:04.078
Do you know what I feel sometimes?

01:21:07.871 --> 01:21:09.357
I wish,

01:21:10.694 --> 01:21:12.520
I hadn't changed so much.

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:14.778
Why do you say that?

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.847
After all, you're giving pleasure
to so many people.

01:21:21.972 --> 01:21:23.533
That's a big thing,

01:21:24.158 --> 01:21:26.301
A good thing. Isn't it?

01:21:27.765 --> 01:21:29.340
You couldn't have done this earlier.

01:21:30.259 --> 01:21:33.861
It ought to give you satisfaction.

01:21:37.342 --> 01:21:38.526
Yes, it does.

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:42.956
This isn't just a profession.

01:21:44.167 --> 01:21:45.167
It's like an addiction.

01:21:46.086 --> 01:21:47.136
Well, that's fine.

01:21:47.811 --> 01:21:49.232
So long as the work goes all right,

01:21:50.318 --> 01:21:51.974
you have nothing to worry about.

01:21:54.552 --> 01:21:57.779
What makes you think I might
have something to worry about?

01:21:59.537 --> 01:22:03.386
You have spoken about losing
your fan following so many times!

01:22:07.398 --> 01:22:09.274
That's just a bad habit of ours.

01:22:10.674 --> 01:22:12.231
Do you know what the trouble is?

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:16.938
Fan following is
a very volatile situation.

01:22:17.842 --> 01:22:20.319
And yet they've made
you what you are.

01:22:21.506 --> 01:22:23.412
I'm no match for you in an argument.

01:22:25.162 --> 01:22:26.745
Because I'm not speaking dialogues.

01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:29.933
Well, I'll leave you to
your work now and go.

01:23:07.767 --> 01:23:08.873
Would you like some toffee?

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.420
Excuse me.

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:11.333
Aren't you sleepy?

01:24:19.190 --> 01:24:20.322
Your fever has gone down.

01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:25.118
Does your mother know?

01:24:41.648 --> 01:24:42.657
Are you sick too?

01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:47.457
These are sleeping pills.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.462
But you've already been to sleep.

01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:54.639
I want to sleep again.

01:24:57.287 --> 01:24:58.873
Can't you sleep without pills?

01:25:02.455 --> 01:25:03.719
What if I don't?

01:25:06.549 --> 01:25:08.108
I'm not taking the risk.

01:25:27.368 --> 01:25:29.029
'I want to be a film actress.'

01:25:30.266 --> 01:25:31.272
'I see.'

01:25:31.955 --> 01:25:35.438
'Since I'm here, you realise,
I really need it.'

01:25:36.552 --> 01:25:37.561
'Maybe.'

01:25:38.646 --> 01:25:40.249
'You're working in
'Maner Manush', right?

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:42.756
'Yes, I think so.'

01:25:46.505 --> 01:25:48.253
'Can I have the female lead?'

01:25:50.318 --> 01:25:51.758
'But the female lead
has been found.'

01:25:53.008 --> 01:25:54.021
'I know.'

01:25:54.658 --> 01:25:55.667
'Then?'

01:25:58.386 --> 01:25:59.656
'Wouldn't I do?'

01:26:01.681 --> 01:26:05.036
'The question does not arise now.
- Don't you have a say?'

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:06.763
'I do have a say.'

01:26:08.213 --> 01:26:09.215
'Please have a seat.'

01:26:09.808 --> 01:26:10.821
'No, thanks.'

01:26:11.809 --> 01:26:15.787
'It's already been decided.
- Couldn't you just try?'

01:26:16.013 --> 01:26:18.787
'Why should I? There should be
some reason for trying.'

01:26:18.871 --> 01:26:22.868
'Why would I do that suddenly?
The actress has been chosen...'

01:26:22.912 --> 01:26:25.218
'I have talent and ambition.'

01:26:25.899 --> 01:26:29.982
'You know no one wants to give
a chance to newcomers.

01:26:32.696 --> 01:26:33.816
'Is that why you are here?'

01:26:34.885 --> 01:26:35.887
'Yes.'

01:26:47.246 --> 01:26:49.046
'Are you trying to see
if I'll suit the role?'

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:50.812
'Are you'

01:26:51.944 --> 01:26:52.944
'married?'

01:27:10.424 --> 01:27:11.428
'Hey...'

01:27:12.236 --> 01:27:14.332
'What happened? What's the matter?'

01:27:18.208 --> 01:27:19.215
'What's this?'

01:27:21.283 --> 01:27:22.284
'Acting!'

01:27:25.304 --> 01:27:26.604
'No need for glycerine.'

01:27:29.235 --> 01:27:30.416
'I've read the book.'

01:27:31.411 --> 01:27:33.465
'I think the part suits
me better than Mandira.'

01:27:34.418 --> 01:27:36.223
'I think you can see that too.'

01:27:38.529 --> 01:27:39.953
'May I know your name?'

01:27:41.114 --> 01:27:43.703
'Why just the name?
The address and phone number...'

01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:46.950
'That's not necessary.
- Why?'

01:27:47.481 --> 01:27:49.619
'Just the name. I'm intrigued.'

01:27:50.275 --> 01:27:53.367
'I must include this curious episode
in my autobiography.'

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.330
'Promila.
- Promila what?'

01:27:57.443 --> 01:27:58.445
'Chatterjee.'

01:27:59.470 --> 01:28:01.359
'Miss.
- I see.'

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:05.716
'Good bye.'

01:28:06.436 --> 01:28:07.476
'It was nice meeting you.'

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.060
'What's the matter now?'

01:28:13.419 --> 01:28:14.419
'You know, '

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.117
'you've made so many films
with so many love scenes, '

01:28:18.387 --> 01:28:21.049
'but when a woman comes to see you
at your house, you're nervous!'

01:28:21.143 --> 01:28:23.598
'Nervous?
- Certainly.'

01:28:24.598 --> 01:28:26.888
'On the contrary,
self controlled, civilised'

01:28:27.662 --> 01:28:28.663
'and well bred.'

01:28:29.949 --> 01:28:32.408
'You look much better
off the screen.'

01:28:34.695 --> 01:28:37.482
'I think you use too much make-up.
- Listen, Miss Chatterjee, '

01:28:38.162 --> 01:28:39.908
'I'm not used to staying up
this late.'

01:28:40.764 --> 01:28:41.764
'I am.'

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.463
'But why should I do'

01:28:45.919 --> 01:28:47.090
'what you wish?'

01:28:49.014 --> 01:28:50.414
'Why don't you come back tomorrow?'

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:53.124
'Tomorrow night?'

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:12.408
Wow! You're a terrific player,
Mr Bose.

01:29:14.456 --> 01:29:16.243
I used to be quite good.

01:29:18.905 --> 01:29:21.148
I studied master games and all that.

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:24.336
Now I'm out of practice.

01:29:27.309 --> 01:29:29.874
If that's out of practice,

01:29:30.492 --> 01:29:33.245
what do you think of the rest of us?

01:29:35.141 --> 01:29:38.192
Alekhine, Capablanca,

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:40.586
Botvinnik...

01:29:42.758 --> 01:29:46.287
I suppose you know that the game
was invented in India.

01:29:46.936 --> 01:29:51.625
Then you must admit,
India does have some...

01:29:52.287 --> 01:29:55.925
Not now, nothing at all.
Nothing at all.

01:29:58.481 --> 01:30:01.456
The queen in the charming white!

01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:06.739
Where has she gone?
- Who? Molly?

01:30:10.663 --> 01:30:13.275
Molly, Jolly,

01:30:13.464 --> 01:30:14.796
Polly, Golly!

01:30:16.792 --> 01:30:20.298
By Golly, you are lucky,
Mr Banerjee.

01:30:20.991 --> 01:30:21.995
No, it's Sarkar.

01:30:22.871 --> 01:30:25.747
Nice. Sarkar. You're lucky.

01:30:26.997 --> 01:30:28.121
That's why, I'm losing.

01:30:32.022 --> 01:30:36.267
You are slow,
Mr Spectrum Advertising. - No!

01:30:37.043 --> 01:30:39.125
Not that one. It would be checkmate.

01:30:39.275 --> 01:30:40.513
Mate?

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:45.635
Your mate is great!

01:30:59.376 --> 01:31:02.327
'Where is Brajeshwar? Brajeshwar!'

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.082
'Where is Brajeshwar? Brajeshwar!'

01:31:13.014 --> 01:31:14.036
'Action!'

01:31:15.433 --> 01:31:19.622
'Long live the worker's union!'

01:31:20.023 --> 01:31:23.847
'Long live the worker's union!'

01:31:24.219 --> 01:31:28.462
'Long live the worker's union!'

01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:31.177
'Long live the worker's union!'

01:31:32.348 --> 01:31:34.167
'Long live the worker's union!'

01:31:34.363 --> 01:31:36.863
'Long live the worker's union!'

01:31:36.888 --> 01:31:39.202
'The train will leave
from platform number 8'

01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:42.081
'at 12:35 pm.'

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.628
'Arindam!'

01:33:20.954 --> 01:33:21.954
'Promila!'

01:33:29.202 --> 01:33:30.209
'Promila!'

01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:34.576
'Promila!'

01:33:36.807 --> 01:33:38.456
'Are you looking for my wife?'

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:41.037
'Your wife?'

01:33:45.159 --> 01:33:48.369
'Don't you know? Who do you think
you're fooling, scoundrel?'

01:33:54.037 --> 01:33:55.657
'Cut!'

01:34:05.002 --> 01:34:07.328
What happened to you?
Are you feeling well?

01:34:29.649 --> 01:34:30.881
Your dinner is here, sir.

01:34:51.493 --> 01:34:52.502
Mr Mukherjee,

01:34:56.561 --> 01:34:58.349
I have a small request.

01:35:00.521 --> 01:35:01.521
Yes?

01:35:02.383 --> 01:35:03.879
I want to work in films.

01:35:04.523 --> 01:35:05.817
Can you help me?

01:35:09.241 --> 01:35:12.959
I used to act in school plays.
I can sing and dance.

01:35:17.246 --> 01:35:19.162
You're travelling with your husband,
aren't you?

01:35:21.664 --> 01:35:23.135
Aren't you?
- I am.

01:35:24.535 --> 01:35:27.181
Tell him I want to see him.
Then we'll see.

01:35:28.337 --> 01:35:29.343
All right?

01:35:36.662 --> 01:35:38.710
Where have you been all this time?

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:43.376
I was just...
- I was just telling your husband

01:35:44.170 --> 01:35:47.423
you must come and see us in Delhi.

01:35:49.285 --> 01:35:51.987
You ought to mix more with people,
don't you think?

01:35:52.486 --> 01:35:54.056
Maybe. Excuse me.

01:36:01.039 --> 01:36:02.048
Sir?

01:36:03.242 --> 01:36:05.642
I'll think about your proposal.

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.170
I can't commit myself just now.

01:36:08.851 --> 01:36:10.326
I'll let you know later.

01:36:11.287 --> 01:36:12.289
Okay, sir...

01:36:33.757 --> 01:36:35.157
Won't you have your dinner now?

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:41.023
Shall I ask them to send it?
- No.

01:36:42.605 --> 01:36:44.132
Molly, you misunderstand me.

01:36:45.601 --> 01:36:47.709
I want to make an
arrangement with you.

01:36:48.705 --> 01:36:49.709
What arrangement?

01:36:50.746 --> 01:36:52.320
I'll do what you want.

01:36:52.995 --> 01:36:55.695
I'll be nice to him.
If that helps you, fine.

01:36:56.642 --> 01:36:59.099
But you must do something for me
in exchange.

01:37:01.213 --> 01:37:02.277
What?

01:37:03.446 --> 01:37:05.111
Tell Arindam Mukherjee that you

01:37:06.117 --> 01:37:08.411
don't object to my being in films.

01:37:09.302 --> 01:37:12.190
You'll have your business
and I'll have my job.

01:37:16.786 --> 01:37:17.792
You want to

01:37:18.767 --> 01:37:19.769
be in films!

01:37:20.942 --> 01:37:21.957
Yes, I do.

01:37:26.583 --> 01:37:27.589
Impossible!

01:38:13.409 --> 01:38:14.496
Hello, there!

01:38:20.349 --> 01:38:21.848
Did you call, sir?

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:24.445
What do you

01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:28.715
call that coach? Sitting...?

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.571
Chair car, sir?
- That's right. Chair car.

01:38:32.796 --> 01:38:34.328
Miss Sengupta,

01:38:35.444 --> 01:38:37.300
fair complexion, glasses

01:38:37.749 --> 01:38:39.905
and a pen

01:38:40.673 --> 01:38:43.439
in her blouse here.

01:38:43.949 --> 01:38:44.956
Do you understand?

01:38:46.102 --> 01:38:47.108
What do you understand?

01:38:47.752 --> 01:38:50.202
Miss Sengupta, fair complexion...
- Yes.

01:38:52.178 --> 01:38:53.185
Glasses...
- Yes.

01:38:55.411 --> 01:38:56.411
And?

01:38:56.477 --> 01:38:58.601
And a fountain pen...
- Where?

01:39:00.987 --> 01:39:04.031
Tucked into her blouse, sir.
- Good, good.

01:39:04.996 --> 01:39:08.097
Tell her that I want to see her.

01:39:20.936 --> 01:39:22.951
Hey! Hey there!

01:39:31.336 --> 01:39:34.393
"Oh, tell me, sweetheart!"

01:39:35.902 --> 01:39:39.338
"Why must we stay apart?"

01:41:39.072 --> 01:41:40.215
Sir!

01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:42.134
Miss Sengupta.

01:41:44.422 --> 01:41:45.778
I see.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.362
You see, I'm...

01:42:00.004 --> 01:42:01.315
I'm drunk.

01:42:08.376 --> 01:42:09.421
I want to

01:42:10.165 --> 01:42:11.970
ask you some questions.

01:42:14.706 --> 01:42:15.707
Go ahead.

01:42:17.734 --> 01:42:18.749
There's something

01:42:19.599 --> 01:42:21.861
about me in the newspapers today.

01:42:23.542 --> 01:42:24.551
Did you know?

01:42:25.874 --> 01:42:26.876
I know.

01:42:29.367 --> 01:42:30.894
Do you know what was behind it?

01:42:32.889 --> 01:42:33.894
No.

01:42:36.476 --> 01:42:37.482
Don't you want to know?

01:42:38.188 --> 01:42:39.195
Why should I?

01:42:40.689 --> 01:42:41.689
But your

01:42:42.417 --> 01:42:44.684
interview won't
be complete without it.

01:42:45.018 --> 01:42:48.345
It doesn't matter.
- But I...

01:43:01.974 --> 01:43:03.236
I must tell you.

01:43:05.644 --> 01:43:06.644
There was

01:43:07.388 --> 01:43:10.100
a marriage... - There's no
need to tell me, Arindam.

01:43:10.362 --> 01:43:12.869
What do you mean no need?
I feel the need.

01:43:13.649 --> 01:43:14.657
What need?

01:43:20.164 --> 01:43:22.291
It's all piled up

01:43:23.604 --> 01:43:24.679
in here.

01:43:29.445 --> 01:43:30.970
There's nobody

01:43:32.464 --> 01:43:33.733
I can tell it all to.

01:43:41.689 --> 01:43:43.082
All those who flock around me now,

01:43:44.295 --> 01:43:45.414
you know...

01:43:46.214 --> 01:43:50.453
The moment I start slipping,
those bastards...

01:44:06.238 --> 01:44:08.153
Let's take it that
you've told me everything.

01:44:08.712 --> 01:44:10.228
I know all there is to know.

01:44:12.936 --> 01:44:15.717
How could you know?
- I can guess.

01:44:21.131 --> 01:44:22.152
Can you

01:44:23.071 --> 01:44:25.032
guess everything?

01:44:25.287 --> 01:44:26.308
Why not?

01:44:27.287 --> 01:44:30.494
Can you guess why my new film

01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:32.461
is going to flop?

01:44:33.583 --> 01:44:34.583
Perhaps I can.

01:44:37.236 --> 01:44:38.311
Then tell me why.

01:44:39.904 --> 01:44:42.870
Since your heart wasn't in it,
you didn't do things properly.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:44.801
Isn't that the reason?

01:44:47.518 --> 01:44:48.564
Wow!

01:44:51.061 --> 01:44:52.219
You're formidable!

01:44:58.155 --> 01:44:59.232
Now do you see

01:45:00.114 --> 01:45:03.343
the God-like hero...

01:45:04.899 --> 01:45:05.902
I have.

01:45:07.171 --> 01:45:08.184
That's it, then.

01:45:09.852 --> 01:45:10.943
You can go now.

01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:13.148
What about you?

01:45:14.148 --> 01:45:15.937
You go first. Then I'll go.

01:45:28.302 --> 01:45:29.307
And...

01:45:30.494 --> 01:45:31.509
You may

01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:35.254
write whatever you like.

01:45:36.102 --> 01:45:38.083
Anything! I don't care!

01:45:38.901 --> 01:45:41.262
Understand, Miss Modern Woman?

01:46:08.466 --> 01:46:09.562
Please...

01:46:11.237 --> 01:46:13.082
Forgive me.

01:46:15.187 --> 01:46:16.231
I'm not feeling well.

01:47:43.781 --> 01:47:46.024
Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:47:51.496 --> 01:47:53.758
Aligarh?
- Nearly there.

01:47:58.416 --> 01:48:00.778
Big headache?
- Yes.

01:48:02.284 --> 01:48:03.284
Big headache?

01:48:04.971 --> 01:48:06.360
You're in advertising, aren't you?

01:48:09.823 --> 01:48:11.295
Yes, up to now.

01:48:13.168 --> 01:48:14.933
Do you take on
religious organisations?

01:48:17.083 --> 01:48:18.244
Religious organisations?

01:48:18.886 --> 01:48:20.351
Advertising?
- Yes.

01:48:27.899 --> 01:48:30.112
Have you heard of WWWW?

01:48:33.906 --> 01:48:36.343
W-W... What are you saying...?
All those Ws...

01:48:36.368 --> 01:48:37.950
Not so many. Just four.

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.044
World Wide Will Workers.

01:48:42.432 --> 01:48:43.878
What workers?
- Will!

01:48:44.428 --> 01:48:48.056
Don't you understand will force?

01:48:48.621 --> 01:48:49.717
I see.

01:48:52.611 --> 01:48:53.774
Here you are, read it.

01:48:55.108 --> 01:48:56.752
Read this.
- I don't have my glasses on.

01:48:56.777 --> 01:48:58.283
I'll read it later.
- I'm sorry.

01:48:58.733 --> 01:49:00.804
Where there is will, there is way.

01:49:01.054 --> 01:49:04.335
Be prognostic and prevent
all calamities and catastrophes.

01:49:05.152 --> 01:49:06.158
Okay?

01:49:08.667 --> 01:49:11.426
We believe that if a
large number of people

01:49:11.777 --> 01:49:14.074
come together and with
full concentration,

01:49:14.387 --> 01:49:17.653
if they will something to happen,
it certainly will.

01:49:18.639 --> 01:49:23.924
Wars, epidemics, famines, anything
can be prognosed and prevented.

01:49:26.518 --> 01:49:28.757
We have branches
in all the big cities of India.

01:49:29.749 --> 01:49:33.224
Now our plan is to further explore
and expand.

01:49:34.121 --> 01:49:37.209
But before that,
we want some publicity

01:49:37.761 --> 01:49:38.811
and an emblem.

01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:40.983
WWWW.

01:49:47.583 --> 01:49:48.677
Have you prepared a budget?

01:49:49.615 --> 01:49:51.337
Budget? Yes.

01:49:52.537 --> 01:49:53.550
Rs 30,000.

01:49:56.724 --> 01:49:57.724
Rs 30,000.

01:49:59.024 --> 01:50:00.024
I see.

01:50:04.021 --> 01:50:05.597
I want to discuss that with you.

01:50:08.017 --> 01:50:09.019
You're going to Delhi,

01:50:11.588 --> 01:50:12.702
aren't you?

01:50:14.155 --> 01:50:15.355
Will you give me your address?

01:50:17.099 --> 01:50:19.263
Let me get down first.
My head is still...

01:50:19.288 --> 01:50:21.615
Let me get down.
- Sure.

01:50:41.931 --> 01:50:42.946
Good morning.

01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:45.846
What?
- Good morning.

01:50:46.327 --> 01:50:47.441
Yes. Good morning.

01:50:50.217 --> 01:50:51.869
My God, so late already!

01:50:52.027 --> 01:50:55.150
I was just thinking
of waking you up.

01:50:56.342 --> 01:50:57.342
Yes, yesterday,

01:50:58.561 --> 01:51:00.143
I couldn't sleep so...

01:51:01.542 --> 01:51:02.544
Oh! Are you hurt?

01:51:03.437 --> 01:51:05.156
Are you hurt?
- No.

01:51:05.975 --> 01:51:07.162
How is she now?

01:51:08.735 --> 01:51:10.164
Temperature is down this morning.

01:51:10.752 --> 01:51:13.108
She thinks it's due to
your magic presence.

01:51:13.372 --> 01:51:15.798
Oh my! I didn't know

01:51:16.685 --> 01:51:18.045
that I had such powers of healing.

01:51:25.978 --> 01:51:27.886
There's something
she wants from you.

01:51:33.142 --> 01:51:34.148
What?

01:51:34.805 --> 01:51:35.928
An autograph.

01:51:40.121 --> 01:51:41.412
Have you got a notebook?

01:51:44.068 --> 01:51:45.068
No?

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.086
Okay, wait.

01:52:05.423 --> 01:52:06.798
May I just borrow your pen?

01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:12.693
Thank you.

01:52:16.223 --> 01:52:17.229
What's your name?

01:52:19.173 --> 01:52:20.197
Sairinidhri.

01:52:24.115 --> 01:52:25.121
Bulbul.

01:52:56.783 --> 01:52:57.810
How are you?

01:53:05.193 --> 01:53:06.227
You know everything.

01:53:07.671 --> 01:53:08.677
You tell me.

01:53:10.283 --> 01:53:11.298
Fine.

01:53:15.537 --> 01:53:16.542
Why not?

01:53:19.818 --> 01:53:22.146
I feel ass if

01:53:23.692 --> 01:53:25.331
there is some void.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.607
I'm missing something.

01:53:29.427 --> 01:53:31.343
Really? Why?

01:53:35.142 --> 01:53:36.615
I don't suppose we'll meet again.

01:53:40.287 --> 01:53:41.893
And you are not
likely to get into films.

01:53:42.294 --> 01:53:44.834
No. You live in a different world.

01:53:46.102 --> 01:53:49.369
We're out on the streets,
in trams and buses.

01:53:50.714 --> 01:53:52.360
If three of my films flop in a row,

01:53:54.391 --> 01:53:56.006
I might go back into that world.

01:53:56.806 --> 01:53:57.833
Don't say that.

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:01.252
I'm sure you'll stay right where
you are, for a long time yet.

01:54:02.373 --> 01:54:04.713
I'm sure you'll have
a huge fan following.

01:54:09.574 --> 01:54:11.328
Your interview...

01:54:20.825 --> 01:54:22.199
Why did you tear it up?

01:54:32.458 --> 01:54:33.790
Will you write from memory?

01:54:38.324 --> 01:54:40.073
I'll keep it in my memory.

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.594
I'll leave now.

01:54:48.412 --> 01:54:49.419
Goodbye.

01:55:37.085 --> 01:55:39.354
'The train to Amritsar...'

01:55:41.848 --> 01:55:44.079
'At 12:50...'
