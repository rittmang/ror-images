WEBVTT

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.874
Is it ready?

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.624
When did I ask for it?

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:20.874
Almost done.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:22.874
Come back.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.624
Get back here right now.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.999
I'll slog all day
and you'll have fun.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.333
What is it?

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:34.832
I asked for some chips.
Why can't you get it?

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:39.374
Why can't you answer?

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:44.249
You slut! I'll bring home the money
and you'll enjoy it.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.457
Are you tired of me?

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.291
Say it... Say it...

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.125
Let Mom go.

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:56.000
Dad, let go of Mom.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.541
Bloody hell! All I wanted was some chips.

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.750
Leave Mom alone.

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.624
I'm beating my wife.
What's your problem?

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.417
Go study.

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:10.916
I've been trying to concentrate
for a long time but I can't.

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:12.457
This has been happening
for a long time.

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:15.332
- Please stop. Will you stop now, please?
- Get out.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.999
Go to your room.
Nothing is going on here.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.541
Your dad will cool down in some time.

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:23.832
- Then the three of us...
- Will go out for dinner.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:26.416
It's your birthday at midnight.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:30.958
Listen to your mother for once.
Go to your room.

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:38.707
Finish your homework.
I'll finish... Anyway...

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:42.166
Did you give birth to this thing?
This bastard?

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:44.249
He can't be mine.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.249
He's so disobedient.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.374
He can't be my son.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.541
- Who else did you sleep with?
- Let Mom go.

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:55.125
Let Mom go, you rascal!

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:10.000
Did you not hear me, idiot?
Let Mom go.

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.249
Say it again.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.750
Let Mom go, rascal.

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:25.542
- Say it again.
- Let Mom go, rascal.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.792
- Say it again.
- Let Mom go, rascal.

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:36.583
- Say it again.
- Let Mom go, rascal.

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.958
I'll beat you to a pulp.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.458
Get lost.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.582
Don't forget that I'm the one who pays
for stuff around here.

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:55.082
You've taught him to misbehave like this.

00:03:55.083 --> 00:04:00.541
Who else did you sleep with?
Is he my son? Tell me.

00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:02.832
I'll kill you.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:05.082
Answer me.

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:09.375
Or I'll thrash answers out of you.

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:47.958
Hello, Bhowanipore Police Station?

00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:51.958
There has been a murder.

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:56.499
I've murdered my father
just moments back.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.332
The address is
105, Harish Mukherjee Road.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:05.958
Once you cross the park,
it's the third house on the right.

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:12.208
Yes... Please come fast.
Okay.

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:03.833
Happy birthday to me.

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:13.707
<i>This is my father,
Debiprasad Bhowmik.</i>

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:17.458
<i>And this little boy is me.</i>

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.541
<i>I'll give you a brief introduction.</i>

00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:21.916
<i>Then I'll be able to tell you
the actual story properly.</i>

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:25.749
<i>Otherwise, we'll spend
all our time... Anyway.</i>

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.624
<i>My father was a serious makeup artist.</i>

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.957
<i>It was a form of worship for him.</i>

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.249
<i>He didn't care about anyone.</i>

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.042
<i>Once he scolded an actor for chatting
in the middle of the makeup session.</i>

00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:43.792
<i>After that everyone fell in line.</i>

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:45.917
<i>Anyway...</i>

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:48.542
<i>My mother left us when I was very young.</i>

00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:50.333
<i>My father meant the world to me.</i>

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:53.999
<i>I followed in his footstep
and started a career in makeup.</i>

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.542
<i>I started studying it.</i>

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.332
<i>Father taught me as well.</i>

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.250
<i>I started learning with all my heart.</i>

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:04.957
<i>I started going to the
neighbourhood library.</i>

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.250
<i>I began devouring all the books on makeup
I could get my hands on.</i>

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:14.833
<i>Then with the access to the internet,
I was unstoppable.</i>

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:19.166
<i>Not just makeup, I started delving into
prosthetics, special effects...</i>

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:25.291
<i>plastic surgery, colours, drawing, art etc.</i>

00:07:25.292 --> 00:07:28.082
<i>National and international artistes...
Oh, yeah...</i>

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:31.000
<i>I completely forgot to tell you...
That's where I got my name...</i>

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:35.332
Van Gogh is the real deal, bro.
He is a true artiste.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.207
He was never appreciated
during his life.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.624
He never sold a painting in his lifetime.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.332
But now the entire world
is crazy about his work.

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:46.249
Actually, he was much ahead
of his time.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.250
Genius!

00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:49.541
- He had enough support.
- What do you mean?

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:54.332
He was nothing without the support
of his brother Theo and friend Ganguin.

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.499
- What are you saying?
- Basically, he was mad.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.768
Just because he cut off his ear
doesn't make him a genius.

00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:03.958
You can call Picasso or Dali genius.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.749
- They brought in a newness in their art.
- That Van Gogh did too.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.124
Please, no point saying that, buddy.

00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:12.457
You can say Van Gogh's strokes
had newness in them.

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.374
Otherwise, it's all Monet and Manet.

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:15.791
They're all amateurs.

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:18.417
- What?
- Excuse me.

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:24.167
Everyone is an amateur
compared to Leonardo.

00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:27.375
The names you just mentioned
were just painters.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.624
But if there is true genius
then it has to be Leonardo da Vinci.

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:34.208
He wasn't only an artiste
but a scientist too.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.957
According to you, Van Gogh, Picasso,
Rembrandt, Dali are all amateurs.

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.582
- Absolutely!
- Are you kidding me?

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:42.916
Why would I?

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:45.082
If you want to argue,
you must study about it.

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:51.749
The only artiste who might come close
is probably Michelangelo.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.874
But Leo is Leo.

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:56.375
- Have you been smoking up?
- Tell us how?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.958
- How?
- Yes.

00:08:58.125 --> 00:08:59.957
I'll explain it to you.

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.582
One must do some research
into the subject.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:03.542
Watch your mouth.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:10.250
Da Vinci was the first to prove to the world
that art is science and science is art.

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.457
Forget the paintings.

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:16.791
The sculptures, the designs for helicopters
and other machines...

00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:21.874
Blueprints of different weapons, the hydraulics,
the pulley and so many other works.

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:25.791
Tell me who else has been able to do it.

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:28.957
Has anyone come close to his achievements?

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:29.958
Give me one name.

00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:35.333
He is a Da Vinci fanboy.

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:41.708
So what's your name?
Da Vinci's fan, Vinci Da?

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:47.333
<i>Whatever my name was...</i>

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:53.667
<i>but the name given by those two
intellectuals that day became popular.</i>

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.208
<i>That name stuck with me.</i>

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:58.250
<i>Yes, I'm Vinci Da.</i>

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:00.208
<i>And this is my story.</i>

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.957
I am happy to announce
that the honourable court...

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.833
has been pleased to rule in favour of
my client Mr. Shyamsundar Jaiswal.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.457
He has been awarded unconditional acquittal
with all damages included.

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:16.332
Due to lack of any substantial evidence
against him.

00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:18.792
Mr. Jaiswal, your reaction on your release?

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:21.291
I am very happy.

00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:23.582
I've been acquitted.
I knew I was innocent.

00:10:23.583 --> 00:10:25.059
And the court said the same thing today.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.374
So, are you saying the Rs. 2500 crore scam
didn't happen?

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.458
Please don't harass my client. Enough.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.542
- No more questions.
- Let me take this.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.707
See, the scam did happen.

00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:36.207
And someone has done it.

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:39.958
But High Court just said
that that person is not me.

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:42.082
Mr. Jaiswal, one last question.

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.624
The company, the hotel,
the resort is all yours.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:45.832
Then, who did the scam?

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:50.583
Just blame it
on the legendary criminal Nando Ghosh.

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:56.875
Hail Lord Vishnu!

00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.917
Hail Lord Vishnu!

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:04.750
Put this on his head, heart and feet.

00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:07.957
<i>The person whose shadow
I've been under...</i>

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.250
<i>The person I learnt my craft from...</i>

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:13.708
<i>The person who never let me feel
the absence of a mother...</i>

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:16.292
<i>That person left me alone one day.</i>

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:20.000
<i>I wanted to remember
his living, smiling face.</i>

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:23.042
<i>Not the stone cold dead face.</i>

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:26.958
<i>I avoided looking at his face
while performing the last rites.</i>

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:30.042
<i>But finally when I saw his face...</i>

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:33.917
<i>I couldn't bear looking at it.</i>

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.125
Sir, where are you going?

00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:53.958
- He's gone crazy.
- He just lost his dad.

00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.625
He used to love his father a lot.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.583
What are you doing?

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.333
Have you lost your mind?

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:16.458
Can't you see his face
is looking so lifeless?

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.625
My father was an artiste.

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:22.791
He should look good for his farewell.

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:24.833
Just these flowers won't do justice.

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.666
What is he talking about?

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:29.792
He's gone bonkers.

00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:38.583
<i>Makeup was done.</i>

00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:40.958
<i>My father entered the set.</i>

00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:45.208
<i>And we waited quietly
for the shot to be over.</i>

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:50.125
<i>I met one of Father's friends
from the film industry.</i>

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:53.375
<i>He said time for experimenting
and studying is over.</i>

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:55.832
<i>I must earn a living now.</i>

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:59.917
<i>I'll never be famous
if I don't get my act together.</i>

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:03.708
<i>He gave me the contact
of a famous director.</i>

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:06.292
<i>He asked me to meet for work.</i>

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:16.125
<i>I forgot to tell you about Jaya.</i>

00:13:16.208 --> 00:13:18.667
<i>She is very sweet girl
from my neighbourhood.</i>

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:24.208
<i>I used to like her a lot.</i>

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:28.208
<i>I was very serious about her, I swear.</i>

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:30.375
<i>You can call it love.</i>

00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:33.666
<i>She was by my side through the ups
and downs, even from a distance.</i>

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:37.167
<i>She was my inspiration
to do great work.</i>

00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:40.625
<i>It was my plan to do something great
for her.</i>

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.375
<i>But it was difficult to meet her
or talk to her.</i>

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:46.041
<i>Her father was very strict.</i>

00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:47.999
And what did you do after that?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.458
I drove the car back, sir.

00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:54.624
But the accused left the hotel lobby
with his girlfriend, Ms. Gupta.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.249
Where did you join them?

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.332
Boss had called me.

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.291
So, I met them on the way.

00:14:00.292 --> 00:14:02.541
And I took the keys.

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:05.667
So, were you driving the car
when the accident happened?

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:10.499
Yes, sir.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:16.458
And your boss's girlfriend
was sitting with you instead of him?

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:17.625
Yes, sir.

00:14:17.626 --> 00:14:19.042
Sure?

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.457
Yes, sir.

00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:24.416
So, when the car hit the divider,
killing Ms. Gupta on the spot...

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:26.917
you were driving the car,
not your boss?

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.375
Yes, sir.

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:35.416
And before the crash, the car ran over
five people sleeping on the pavement...

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.374
you were driving the car,
not your boss?

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:42.917
They constantly want fresh blood.
Is this a blood bank?

00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.542
Sir, Debiprasad's son is here.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.332
Send him here.

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:49.416
- Here he comes.
- Who?

00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:50.333
Come here.

00:14:50.334 --> 00:14:53.208
Are you talking about Debi Bhowmik?

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.207
Isn't he from the Ice Ages?

00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:57.417
He passed away recently.

00:14:57.667 --> 00:15:03.083
A common friend asked me to meet his son
to give him work.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.667
Hello, sir.

00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:09.375
Abhijeet told me about you.

00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:14.042
Do you have any skills or are you
using your father's name to get work?

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:16.083
I am good at what I do.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.250
Great.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.582
Why did you leave Sujit's shoot?

00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:23.875
What?

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.583
I felt insulted that's why.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.042
Why?

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:35.125
He told me before the shoot started
that we have to compete with Bombay.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.207
I was doing the prosthetic makeup.

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:40.500
A man who had been in a blast.

00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:44.125
I had spent four and a half hours
to get the actor ready.

00:15:44.417 --> 00:15:47.708
Sujit said it was excellent work.

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:50.125
But then he said...

00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:54.875
The prosthetic makeup was so realistic,
the blood, the skin...

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:59.042
that the Censor Board
would chop that scene off.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:03.749
If that was the case,
why did he push me so hard?

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.542
That's why I quit.

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:09.167
You want to surpass
the Bombay film industry, right?

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:11.167
I don't want to.
I can.

00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:15.582
And I can do it in half the budget.

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.667
Got it.

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:20.250
Hey, come here.

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:25.666
Call Vikram and push the call time
by an hour.

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:26.250
Okay.

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:29.124
Take him to the actress
and explain the character to him.

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:29.542
Okay.

00:16:29.543 --> 00:16:30.833
Go with him.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.582
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:36.458
I want to see your work.

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:39.583
Fresh blood.

00:16:41.708 --> 00:16:44.582
- You are unneccesarily tensed.
- It's not about that.

00:16:44.583 --> 00:16:47.249
- It's nothing. Nothing will happen.
- Things are getting worse.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.457
It's not about confidence. It's okay.
Nothing to worry about.

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:52.082
These people again.

00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:54.374
No comments. No comments.

00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:56.666
You'll get to know anyway.
Please move out of the way.

00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:58.541
- Please give way.
- Excuse me. Excuse us.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:00.958
Please... No comments...

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.417
He got the acquittal after all.

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.166
He was supposed to get it anyway.

00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:10.707
The last judge got transferred.

00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:13.083
The one before him died mysteriously.

00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:15.583
Who will take this kind of pressure?

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:17.458
What happened to the girl?

00:17:17.542 --> 00:17:18.582
What else?

00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:20.624
If she has money, she'll appeal again.

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:21.916
Next, it'll go to the Supreme Court.

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:25.374
The person who was raped will have to
prove that she was raped yet again.

00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:26.917
Ridiculous!

00:17:27.042 --> 00:17:29.082
He is very perverted.

00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:30.957
He has a distorted mind.

00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.917
He is very experimental.

00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:34.792
And he films himself in the act.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.417
Hey!

00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:38.332
What have you done?

00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:40.583
Didn't my assistant brief you?

00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:42.749
He just told me about the character.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.499
I found out about the entire story
and today's scene.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.208
I did this makeup after I figured out
the flow of the scene.

00:17:50.875 --> 00:17:55.833
After so much effort, you came up
with this ugly, realistic makeup?

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:58.791
Don't you understand gloss at all?

00:17:58.792 --> 00:18:00.832
What is the problem with beauty?

00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:02.791
Sir, the character is starving
for 10 days.

00:18:02.792 --> 00:18:03.708
She's struggling.

00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:08.666
If she looks like a glamourous model,
will we be doing justice to the audience?

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:10.707
This is an urban mainstream film.

00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:14.457
People will be watching the heroine
and her acting not your makeup.

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:15.791
Makeup is a part of acting.

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:16.832
So is the camera's angle.

00:18:16.833 --> 00:18:20.291
The writer's dialogue is as much a part of
the acting as is the production design.

00:18:20.292 --> 00:18:22.999
We don't need you right now.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.125
If there's something in the future
projects, we'll call you. Good bye.

00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:30.917
What is so funny?

00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:36.083
Sir, you asked me if I was using
my father's name to get work.

00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.792
Sir, I'm not doing it but...

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:44.625
I can see you're using your late uncle's
legacy to get work in the industry.

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:47.957
The first film was good.
But I couldn't sit through the next four.

00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.166
Horrible makeup, horrible costume.

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:52.291
The most horrible thing was the art.

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:54.166
Absolutely no research on props, right?

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.542
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:58.250
Nobody.

00:18:59.917 --> 00:19:05.249
I'm one of the technicians who you haven't
paid despite having a lot of black money.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.125
Hey.

00:19:06.126 --> 00:19:11.917
You will not get a job here
or anywhere else in the country.

00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:13.333
I know.

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:17.167
That's why I want to tell you something
before I leave.

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:24.166
It's just your luck that even after being
such a bad actor, you're still a super star.

00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:25.499
And you know that very well.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.750
So don't show your expertise
about makeup.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.541
Makeup is an art.

00:19:29.542 --> 00:19:31.500
Your thick brain can't handle it.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.542
Bloody swine!

00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:56.542
You didn't get the job?

00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:58.542
Nope.

00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:02.583
They abused me and threw me out,
bloody idiots.

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:07.000
Forget about them.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.875
You'll find another job.

00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:12.042
Like hell, I will.

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.167
They're very powerful people.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.583
They'll not let me work
in the film industry anymore.

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:22.833
That's okay.

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:26.083
You can... find some other work...

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:33.958
You have time.

00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:39.917
Because I stammer...

00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:44.042
they can't find a groom for me...

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.833
We'll get married, right?

00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:59.667
During the rituals,
you'll have to chant Sanskrit words...

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:03.292
How will you utter those?

00:21:05.083 --> 00:21:06.125
I've thought about it.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.333
I'm quite stressed about it.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.417
- The priest from the neighbourhood...
- Bonomali...

00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:23.167
I've learnt the important part.

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:25.292
I'll just say that.

00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.583
Repeatedly...
What will you say?

00:21:29.292 --> 00:21:30.542
You know...

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:35.542
"May my heart be yours.

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:42.208
- May your heart...
- May your heart...

00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:51.542
Catch that man!
Pickpocket!

00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:17.042
Thank you, brother.

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:19.000
Thank you.

00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:21.416
So, where are you going right now?

00:22:21.417 --> 00:22:22.857
We have to go to the police station.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.583
What?

00:22:23.584 --> 00:22:25.292
Yeah, you broke the law.

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:26.768
Now we have to put it back together.

00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:28.072
- What do you mean?
- You'll see.

00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:51.208
<i>I lied a little while ago.</i>

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.333
<i>This is the first time in my boring life
I've got a chance to be the hero.</i>

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.250
<i>That's why I couldn't help myself.</i>

00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.375
<i>This is not just my story.</i>

00:23:01.417 --> 00:23:02.958
<i>It's his story too.</i>

00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:06.458
<i>He was a little screwed
up since he was a kid.</i>

00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:09.583
<i>He has a sharp mind.
He's very well read.</i>

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:12.583
<i>And he's crazy about Law.</i>

00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:16.125
<i>He wanted to be a criminal lawyer.</i>

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.208
<i>He loved his mother.</i>

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:21.208
<i>His father was a drunk scum.</i>

00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.750
<i>And that's where the trouble started.</i>

00:23:24.208 --> 00:23:27.707
<i>He killed his father exactly half an hour
before he turned 18...</i>

00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:29.042
<i>and escaped the death penalty.</i>

00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:32.167
Oh, you're here?

00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.583
I'm ready to go.

00:23:36.417 --> 00:23:37.708
Let's go.

00:23:39.708 --> 00:23:40.917
Do you want some chips?

00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:46.167
<i>He freed his mother from
that horrible life.</i>

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.375
<i>But strangely, his mother got scared.</i>

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.583
<i>She thought he was crazy
and left him alone.</i>

00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:55.499
<i>He killed his father.
His mother left him.</i>

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.916
<i>For the lack of opportunity,
situation, time and money...</i>

00:23:58.917 --> 00:24:00.958
<i>He couldn't become a criminal lawyer.</i>

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.750
<i>Instead, he got a criminal record.</i>

00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:09.083
<i>But he was not one to give up.</i>

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.542
<i>He continued studying Law
even inside the asylum.</i>

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.583
<i>He would feel very unsettled
if he was not close to the Law.</i>

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.417
<i>So, he started going to the court
after being released from the asylum.</i>

00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:27.458
<i>He started taking notes
on the difficult cases.</i>

00:24:27.917 --> 00:24:31.167
<i>Then he set up his own office
outside the courtroom.</i>

00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:35.792
<i>Experienced lawyers would drop by
to take his advice on cases.</i>

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.041
<i>He earned a lot of money.</i>

00:24:38.042 --> 00:24:43.542
<i>But by that time, Adi Bose
had completely lost his mind.</i>

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:51.250
Mukherjee, of all the police stations
under me...

00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:54.750
yours is the most efficient.

00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:56.893
So, see to it,
this doesn't happen again.

00:24:56.917 --> 00:24:58.000
It won't, sir.

00:24:58.042 --> 00:25:00.124
If we get a high profile case.

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:01.958
Involving ministers, businessmen etc...

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.268
- Then we'll need your help.
- Of course, I'll look into it.

00:25:04.292 --> 00:25:06.374
- You can't go in.
- It's urgent.

00:25:06.375 --> 00:25:08.124
Sorry, sir.
He just barged in.

00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:10.458
Wait. Yes, tell me.

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:13.042
There's a pickpocket in my car.

00:25:13.583 --> 00:25:15.625
He was beaten very badly by a mob.
He's dying.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.750
Please look into it.

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:21.000
Take a look.
Give him the keys.

00:25:21.167 --> 00:25:22.500
The car is not locked.

00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:25.916
Where did you find him?

00:25:25.917 --> 00:25:27.292
I was on my way to the court.

00:25:27.417 --> 00:25:29.292
Saw him... Brought him here.

00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:30.917
I'm a lawyer, sir.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.792
Where do you practice?
Alipore Court?

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.666
No... Actually, I don't...

00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:38.875
I haven't started yet.
About to start my practice.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.083
- Civil?
- No.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.833
Criminal.

00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:45.833
Sir?

00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:47.833
He is in a very bad state.

00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:49.844
We've to take him to the
hospital right now.

00:25:51.042 --> 00:25:52.333
Then, take him.

00:25:54.708 --> 00:25:56.518
Why didn't you take him to the hospital?
What if he died?

00:25:56.542 --> 00:25:57.708
But, sir, the Law?

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.071
Law comes before everything else.

00:25:59.208 --> 00:26:01.333
Life and death are secondary.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.500
Okay.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:07.583
Actually, the Law is our living, Mr...

00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:09.625
- Adi Bose.
- Adi Bose.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.167
The thing is, if the criminal dies...

00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:18.042
we can't follow him into
the pyre to cuff him.

00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:21.375
But Law's hands are not that long.

00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:23.458
That's why you need a hook like me.

00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:26.833
Like picking a fruit from the tree.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.180
Sir, what sections will you
book him under?

00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:38.374
Normal ones...
Whatever is applicable for pickpocketing.

00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:41.250
There are no provisions for pickpocketing
in the Indian Penal Code.

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.601
You'll have to book him under theft.

00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:44.291
378 and 379.

00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:46.476
And there's mental trauma caused
to the person he stole from.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.940
That amounts to voluntary harassment, so you
can charge him under Section 323, as well.

00:26:51.542 --> 00:26:52.625
Good bye.

00:26:57.083 --> 00:26:58.083
What was his name?

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:39.458
Are you done?

00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:45.791
How much longer?

00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:49.500
You have to wait.
You're too restless.

00:27:49.708 --> 00:27:53.750
Sit quietly. Don't move.
And don't blink at all.

00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:59.167
Irritating me all the time.

00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:26.500
Hey, what's the matter with you?

00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:32.250
- Do you want some tea, Uncle?
- Yeah.

00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:36.124
I left town for a few days...

00:28:36.125 --> 00:28:38.750
and you've screwed things up
in the meantime.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.667
Got it.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.291
What have I done wrong this time?

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:51.124
What? Don't you want to work
in the industry anymore?

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:54.375
You've picked a fight again in the studio.

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:57.542
They've complained to you, right?

00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:01.750
They were saying a lot of mean
things to me. I kept quiet.

00:29:01.917 --> 00:29:04.541
They said whatever they felt like.

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:08.667
I'm a self-respecting artiste.
How can I tolerate such nonsense?

00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:12.166
Apparently, I use my dad's name to get work
and I don't have any makeup skills.

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:15.499
Those bloody idiots.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.416
I work from the heart.

00:29:17.417 --> 00:29:21.500
And the director criticising my work
just runs an assembly line factory.

00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:24.292
All he wants is to earn money.
He is not interested in films at all.

00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:26.249
- I'm the only one who says...
- Why don't you adjust a bit.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.332
Absolutely not.

00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:29.875
Am I a newbie that I'll keep my head down?

00:29:30.958 --> 00:29:34.500
I'm poor but I'm proud of my work.
I am happy.

00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:38.208
I heard you're doing makeup for the
kids' plays and brides to earn money.

00:29:38.292 --> 00:29:43.875
- An artiste like you...
- An artiste doesn't differentiate...

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:49.917
The ordinary girl I dress up
on her wedding day...

00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:52.975
the happiness on her face
is nothing less than the National Award.

00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.417
It's difficult work.

00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:59.792
And you were talking about the kids' play?
Damn right, I do them.

00:30:00.042 --> 00:30:01.518
They are more honest
than the film people.

00:30:01.542 --> 00:30:04.332
The honesty with which they perform...

00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:08.207
the big directors and so called actors
from the industry will soil their pants.

00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:09.707
They'll feel ashamed.

00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:12.250
So you will not change, right?

00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:14.833
Will you have some biscuits?

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:42.374
<i>I delve into your mind
but find only masks</i>

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:49.958
<i>Like a hunter waiting to kill
You hide</i>

00:30:51.042 --> 00:30:58.666
<i>I look into your eyes
I'm lost in your train of thoughts</i>

00:30:58.667 --> 00:31:06.167
<i>The sore wounds don't stop bleeding</i>

00:31:07.125 --> 00:31:13.874
<i>The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real</i>

00:31:13.875 --> 00:31:17.624
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:21.417
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:25.374
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:29.416
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:31.750
<i>Every day</i>

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:46.000
<i>The stench of burning flesh
Comes from your room</i>

00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:54.125
<i>Darkness grabs me</i>

00:31:54.917 --> 00:32:02.582
<i>Your heart cages the gods</i>

00:32:02.583 --> 00:32:10.125
<i>Mankind creeps towards extinction</i>

00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:17.874
<i>The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real</i>

00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:21.582
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:25.542
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:32:25.583 --> 00:32:29.416
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:32:29.417 --> 00:32:33.958
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:41.457
Does Mr. Vinci live here?

00:32:41.458 --> 00:32:43.249
Da... It's Vinci Da.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.250
Tell me.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.208
I wanted to talk to you about a film.

00:32:48.125 --> 00:32:49.832
Film...

00:32:49.833 --> 00:32:51.958
Please take a seat.
Please sit.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.292
Give me a minute.

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.500
Sorry... The house is a mess...

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.583
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

00:33:05.708 --> 00:33:08.083
- There's a film being made.
- Oh, okay.

00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:12.333
Shyamsundar Jaiswal, the businessman.

00:33:13.542 --> 00:33:17.125
- Shyamsundar was in...
- Jail but not anymore.

00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:20.000
It's based on his life.
He's had a very interesting life.

00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:24.417
Biopic... Bumba, the superstar
will play his character.

00:33:24.542 --> 00:33:25.500
Okay.

00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:27.792
We were trying out prosthetic makeup.

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.083
We spoke to some people in Bombay.

00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:31.500
Dates are clashing.

00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:33.167
And the cost is very high.

00:33:33.375 --> 00:33:34.750
Really high.

00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:37.750
That's why we decided to get someone
from Kolkata.

00:33:37.917 --> 00:33:41.250
Everyone in the industry vouched for you.

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:44.292
Are you interested?

00:33:46.042 --> 00:33:47.042
What?

00:33:50.667 --> 00:33:53.625
It's a huge offer.

00:33:53.792 --> 00:33:56.125
Such a great opportunity.

00:33:56.917 --> 00:33:59.500
Actually, I've been doing
it for a long time.

00:33:59.708 --> 00:34:03.083
I've been doing research
for the last 10 years.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.874
But there's not much prosthetic work...

00:34:06.875 --> 00:34:07.500
I know.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.500
Yeah...

00:34:08.833 --> 00:34:11.500
But I've been carrying on with my work.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.625
So, I can do it.

00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:17.041
But prosthetics are expensive.

00:34:17.042 --> 00:34:18.166
That's alright.

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:19.207
But how would it be?

00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:21.957
Will it be like a mask?

00:34:21.958 --> 00:34:26.707
It'll be very real.
You won't be able to tell the difference.

00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:27.749
- You get it?
- I get it?

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.832
The person whose face we'll be copying...

00:34:29.833 --> 00:34:34.542
the colour of his skin,
each wrinkle...

00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:35.791
the colour of his eyes...

00:34:35.792 --> 00:34:36.708
- Will it match?
- Absolutely...

00:34:36.709 --> 00:34:38.792
You won't be able to tell them apart.

00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:40.707
- I'll match it exactly.
- That's exactly what I want.

00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:45.541
For a perfect fit,
I'll have to measure Bumba's face.

00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:48.999
The mask has to be fixed
on his face.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.934
- You get it?
- You'll have to make a sample first.

00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:53.500
Make one according to my face.

00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:54.875
Let me show it to them.

00:34:55.042 --> 00:34:56.708
Let them see it.

00:34:57.042 --> 00:35:01.375
If it's approved you can go
and take Bumba's measurement.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.332
We're in a hurry.

00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:05.167
It'll be done on time.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.417
I'll have to buy the chemicals
and materials.

00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:14.000
- So, if you can give some advance...
- Of course... Here you go.

00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:14.792
What's this?

00:35:14.793 --> 00:35:20.250
This has Jaiswal's photos and videos
for your reference.

00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:23.791
There's a difference in their heights
and body structures...

00:35:23.792 --> 00:35:25.166
- There won't be an issue...
- Are you sure?

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:28.875
I can make him fatter with a body suit.

00:35:29.375 --> 00:35:32.082
- I can make him wear heels...
- Won't be too different, right?

00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:34.250
It would be exact.
No one will be able to tell.

00:35:34.542 --> 00:35:36.708
Great! You get to work.
When should I come?

00:35:37.417 --> 00:35:41.499
<i>Some events alter our lives
so much that...</i>

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.625
<i>you think while drinking...</i>

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:48.292
<i>What would my life be
if that event didn't happen?</i>

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.208
<i>What would happen to me?</i>

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:52.375
<i>Would I then...</i>

00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:57.542
<i>Yes, meeting Adi Bose
was that life altering event for me.</i>

00:35:58.083 --> 00:36:03.333
<i>It was very difficult to ignore
the part of my brain that he had tickled.</i>

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.625
<i>Art, my friend, art.</i>

00:36:07.375 --> 00:36:11.666
<i>Asking me to do a complicated
and difficult makeup was like...</i>

00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:17.458
<i>asking a starving tiger to taste a deer.</i>

00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:19.917
<i>And you know what?</i>

00:36:20.625 --> 00:36:24.499
<i>The relationship between an artiste
and the blank canvas is like...</i>

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.833
<i>lovers' naked bodies.</i>

00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:31.875
<i>Do you remember the feeling
of touching your lover for the first time?</i>

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.875
<i>I felt the same way.</i>

00:36:35.167 --> 00:36:38.750
<i>I felt a spark
when I touched his face for the first time.</i>

00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:42.250
<i>This canvas will make
me paint a masterpiece.</i>

00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:44.417
<i>And that's what happened.</i>

00:36:44.833 --> 00:36:47.000
<i>Standing in front of the mirror...</i>

00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:49.207
<i>the duet between my hand and his face...</i>

00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:52.875
<i>had resulted in something like
a Vitruvian Man.</i>

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.749
<i>I delve into your mind
but find only masks</i>

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:23.333
<i>Like a hunter waiting to kill
You hide</i>

00:37:24.417 --> 00:37:32.041
<i>I look into your eyes
I'm lost in your train of thoughts</i>

00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:39.083
<i>The sore wounds don't stop bleeding</i>

00:37:40.292 --> 00:37:47.291
<i>The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real</i>

00:37:47.292 --> 00:37:51.041
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:37:51.042 --> 00:37:54.833
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:37:55.083 --> 00:37:59.166
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:37:59.167 --> 00:38:03.082
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:38:03.083 --> 00:38:06.875
<i>Every day</i>

00:38:11.792 --> 00:38:19.457
<i>The stench of burning flesh
Comes from your room</i>

00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:25.875
<i>Darkness grabs me</i>

00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:36.041
<i>Your heart cages the gods</i>

00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:43.250
<i>Mankind creeps towards extinction</i>

00:38:44.417 --> 00:38:51.249
<i>The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real</i>

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.999
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.792
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.749
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.916
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:39:06.917 --> 00:39:09.625
<i>Every day</i>

00:39:38.958 --> 00:39:46.541
<i>What's burning in that head of yours?</i>

00:39:46.542 --> 00:39:53.792
<i>Let it burn
But the beehive doesn't break</i>

00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:03.041
<i>You have the fever
without a cure</i>

00:40:03.042 --> 00:40:11.042
<i>This everlasting fear doesn't let go</i>

00:40:11.292 --> 00:40:18.291
<i>The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real</i>

00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:22.249
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:26.124
<i>He hears the dead scream</i>

00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:30.500
<i>He lives in a lonely corner</i>

00:40:32.583 --> 00:40:34.999
<i>This bank has been robbed
in broad daylight.</i>

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.707
<i>The person behind this crime is famous
businessman, Shyamshundar Jaiswal.</i>

00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:45.458
<i>He can be clearly spotted on
the bank's CCTV footage and phone videos.</i>

00:40:58.417 --> 00:41:01.457
<i>He pointed his gun at us
and took all the money.</i>

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:04.541
<i>There was a scuffle with
the security guard.</i>

00:41:04.542 --> 00:41:06.207
<i>Then he shot the man.</i>

00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:10.458
<i>I still have shivers down my spine.</i>

00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:16.541
<i>I have seen with my own eyes
that it was Shyamsundar Jaiswal.</i>

00:41:16.542 --> 00:41:19.041
<i>The guy who was involved
in the scam.</i>

00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:21.457
<i>He came in
and threatened everyone.</i>

00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:25.624
<i>He pointed his gun at everyone
and took all the money.</i>

00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:27.791
<i>He even got into a scuffle
with the security guard.</i>

00:41:27.792 --> 00:41:29.791
<i>He shot the security guard.</i>

00:41:29.792 --> 00:41:33.417
<i>He's missing since morning.
Police are looking into it.</i>

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:35.167
<i>We've started the investigation.</i>

00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:37.292
<i>The area has been cordoned off.</i>

00:41:37.958 --> 00:41:41.458
<i>You'll get to know if we discover
any new information.</i>

00:41:41.542 --> 00:41:43.292
<i>Till then please wait outside.
Thank you.</i>

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:45.874
<i>No one is being allowed inside the bank.</i>

00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:50.167
<i>Even DCDD Bijoy Poddar
has no further comments.</i>

00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:55.042
Hello, Rajdeep.

00:41:55.083 --> 00:41:56.792
Yes, I had kept my phone switched off.

00:41:56.833 --> 00:41:59.333
You know that I have my appointment
with Pinky.

00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:00.582
What should I do now?

00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:02.749
What the heck is this?
I don't understand.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.000
The media will say anything, Rajdeep.

00:42:05.083 --> 00:42:05.708
Bail?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.625
What do you think?
I'll murder someone for petty cash?

00:42:08.667 --> 00:42:11.207
Okay, I'm canceling everything
and heading to the farmhouse.

00:42:11.208 --> 00:42:12.250
But for how many days?

00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:14.207
Any other number? SMS?

00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:15.458
Take me to the farmhouse.

00:42:29.208 --> 00:42:32.541
<i>We're standing in front
of Shyamsundar Jaiswal's house.</i>

00:42:32.542 --> 00:42:36.207
<i>He's missing since the bank robbery
in the morning.</i>

00:42:36.208 --> 00:42:39.832
<i>We've been trying to reach him
since morning but he remains at large.</i>

00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:43.667
<i>But according to his office colleagues
he is out of the city.</i>

00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:48.207
<i>He's the same guy involved
in the scam.</i>

00:42:48.208 --> 00:42:49.832
<i>I saw him with my own eyes.</i>

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:53.333
<i>His lawyer just told us
he is not in the city.</i>

00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:57.082
<i>My client had mentioned
that he'll be going out of Kolkata today.</i>

00:42:57.083 --> 00:42:58.624
<i>And I know it's true.</i>

00:42:58.625 --> 00:43:00.332
<i>I'm sure my client is innocent.</i>

00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:02.625
<i>Then who robbed the bank?</i>

00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:05.000
I really don't know where he is.

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:07.875
He never tells me anything.

00:43:07.958 --> 00:43:09.833
I can understand but...

00:43:10.583 --> 00:43:11.417
you must know something.

00:43:11.418 --> 00:43:15.375
I've already told you that he had gone
towards Singur to look at some land.

00:43:15.625 --> 00:43:17.250
He even called me.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.792
Since then, I don't know his whereabouts.

00:43:20.333 --> 00:43:21.917
His phone is switched off too.

00:43:24.708 --> 00:43:26.333
Sorry but I must say this.

00:43:27.417 --> 00:43:29.500
There's the CCTV footage
from the bank.

00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:33.208
Plus some phone videos of the robbery
and the murder.

00:43:33.458 --> 00:43:34.708
And then, there's you.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.500
And you are Jaiswal's right hand man.

00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:41.375
A phone call that you received
that no one else heard.

00:43:42.458 --> 00:43:44.542
Do you really consider it an alibi?

00:43:45.292 --> 00:43:46.457
Please check my call list.

00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:48.625
I don't doubt that he called you.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:52.208
He could have called you after the robbery
from highway while he was fleeing.

00:43:52.792 --> 00:43:54.207
I don't know what you spoke about.

00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:57.625
Why are you harassing us, sir?

00:43:58.292 --> 00:43:59.542
Why would he do it?

00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:04.999
If he wants he can buy
six of those banks...

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.375
The thing is...

00:44:06.542 --> 00:44:09.042
There's a difference between six banks
and one police station.

00:44:09.208 --> 00:44:13.125
The man who has died was newly wed
and his father is unwell.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.791
One more word from you
and I'll slap you hard...

00:44:15.792 --> 00:44:18.167
And my alibi will be I
was with your mother.

00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:19.833
Bloody idiot!

00:44:20.417 --> 00:44:21.417
What's the number?

00:44:21.917 --> 00:44:22.583
Whose?

00:44:22.584 --> 00:44:23.958
Not your mother's.

00:44:24.542 --> 00:44:27.417
- Shyamsundar's...
- 9830033344.

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:29.208
Do I look like a rookie?

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:30.833
I have this number.

00:44:31.958 --> 00:44:35.542
Give me his driver's number.
We'll use it for geotracking.

00:44:36.583 --> 00:44:37.667
<i>Who did this?</i>

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:40.708
Who said it?

00:44:43.417 --> 00:44:46.083
I want an answer now.

00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:48.667
Rohit started it, sir.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.499
Is that true, Rohit?

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.042
It was all over the internet, sir.

00:44:53.208 --> 00:44:56.500
- It's true. Disha's dad has killed someone.
- Shut up!

00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:58.375
Just shut up.

00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:03.792
Three of you go back to your classes.
Three of you stay back.

00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:07.333
And Disha, I think,
you should be going home.

00:45:17.792 --> 00:45:20.458
Move... Move... Quick.
This way.

00:45:20.542 --> 00:45:22.375
- Sir...
- Follow me.

00:45:24.333 --> 00:45:25.333
Follow me.

00:45:25.334 --> 00:45:26.624
Go to the first floor. Quick.

00:45:26.625 --> 00:45:28.083
You go to the bedroom.

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:30.874
- Come with me.
- What are you doing here?

00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:32.416
- Cover it from all sides.
- From the front...

00:45:32.417 --> 00:45:34.541
- I'm approaching the back.
- There he is...

00:45:34.542 --> 00:45:36.249
- Bapi, this way...
- Sir, he has a gun.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.666
Cover me, I'm going in.

00:45:37.667 --> 00:45:38.957
- Kick the door open.
- Watch the left side.

00:45:38.958 --> 00:45:40.167
Break the door.
Kick it in.

00:45:41.917 --> 00:45:43.583
Who are you people?

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:48.417
- What are you doing?
- Put him in the van...

00:45:48.542 --> 00:45:50.166
- Why are doing this?
- Shut up.

00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:52.500
- Bapi, hurry up...
- Let me go.

00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:54.249
Come on... Let's go...

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.041
Let me talk to my lawyer.

00:45:56.042 --> 00:45:58.750
Do you know who I am?

00:45:59.875 --> 00:46:01.875
Robbing a bank, killing a security guard...

00:46:02.042 --> 00:46:04.542
Carrying a gun without license,
shooting a cop...

00:46:05.542 --> 00:46:06.916
Of course, I know who you are.

00:46:06.917 --> 00:46:08.207
Get in the car.

00:46:08.208 --> 00:46:11.041
- Let's go.
- Believe me, I haven't done anything.

00:46:11.042 --> 00:46:14.083
Get in. Let's go.

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:18.708
- I haven't done anything...
- Shut up.

00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:23.207
<i>Shyamsundar Jaiswal is being presented
in court today.</i>

00:46:23.208 --> 00:46:25.499
<i>DCDD Poddar is also present.</i>

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.124
<i>The police said he was arrested
from his farmhouse last night.</i>

00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:35.083
<i>Along with the robbery, he is also accused
of murdering a security guard.</i>

00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:45.416
<i>His 10-year-old daughter
tried to commit suicide.</i>

00:46:45.417 --> 00:46:47.749
<i>His lawyer still insists he's innocent.</i>

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.916
<i>And that he was out of the city
at the time of the crime.</i>

00:46:49.917 --> 00:46:52.416
<i>The police has arrested him
from his farmhouse, right?</i>

00:46:52.417 --> 00:46:57.125
<i>How can one man be in two places
at the same time?</i>

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.624
<i>And we'll prove that in court.</i>

00:46:59.625 --> 00:47:00.625
<i>My client is innocent.</i>

00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:01.458
Watching the news?

00:47:01.459 --> 00:47:03.666
<i>He's being framed.
There's a conspiracy...</i>

00:47:03.667 --> 00:47:05.249
What's all this?

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:06.250
<i>Please, wait...</i>

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:08.708
Isn't it great?

00:47:09.042 --> 00:47:10.500
Why are you laughing?

00:47:11.125 --> 00:47:12.457
What is so funny?

00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:16.582
What are they showing on TV?
You told me it's for a film.

00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:19.541
Bumba the superstar...

00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:21.791
- Shyamsundar in my prosthetic...
- I'll tell you everything.

00:47:21.792 --> 00:47:23.333
I did my job.

00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:26.541
But they're saying the same person
is in both places.

00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:29.416
- Yeah...
- Tell me something...

00:47:29.417 --> 00:47:31.582
I've seen that face on TV.

00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:33.916
That prosthetic, that makeup...

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.499
Did I do it?

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.332
- And that man?
- That's me.

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:38.667
You couldn't tell?

00:47:39.208 --> 00:47:40.917
What can I say?

00:47:43.625 --> 00:47:45.458
- You robbed a bank?
- Yes.

00:47:47.917 --> 00:47:50.167
- You killed the guard?
- Yeah...

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:54.207
- You shot the cop?
- That I didn't...

00:47:54.208 --> 00:47:55.875
I didn't shoot the cop.

00:47:55.958 --> 00:48:00.458
Shyamsundar had a panic attack
and shot him.

00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.708
But I did everything in the bank.

00:48:04.958 --> 00:48:07.457
But why?

00:48:07.458 --> 00:48:09.708
I'll tell you
but first some tea.

00:48:10.625 --> 00:48:13.625
Please make some strong tea
with ginger.

00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:15.583
I'll tell you everything.

00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:38.875
Thank you.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.875
You see Vinci Da,
I'm a serial lawyer.

00:48:47.875 --> 00:48:49.250
What do you mean?

00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:56.750
According to normal definitions,
I'm a serial killer.

00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:02.000
Apparently, I'm mentally disturbed.

00:49:02.208 --> 00:49:06.167
I choose my victims according to a pattern
stuck in my mind.

00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:09.082
Victim's pattern?

00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:10.999
Yeah, that's it.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.041
Say Shyamsundar,
my so-called victim.

00:49:14.042 --> 00:49:15.917
Am I killing him?

00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:18.625
Am I killing him?

00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.957
No, I'm not.

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.833
He's the killer.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:28.291
He's swindled so much money.

00:49:28.292 --> 00:49:32.416
He's stealing poor people's savings.

00:49:32.417 --> 00:49:36.541
So many people are suffering,
committing suicide.

00:49:36.542 --> 00:49:39.458
It was a Rs. 2500 crore scam.
Didn't you read in the papers?

00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:43.750
But he got away with it
because he is powerful.

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:48.625
I committed a crime like him
and gave him up to the law.

00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:54.458
Crime like him?

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:58.375
Crime... If you think of it as crime.

00:49:59.292 --> 00:50:01.874
Then you're a criminal.
I'm a criminal.

00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:03.749
We're partners in crime.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:06.042
- Right?
- What?

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.875
You might think like that.
But I think you are an artiste.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.249
He's robbed the common man
and I've robbed the bank.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.166
It's the same thing.
Isn't it?

00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:20.917
Bank robberies are a thing of the past now.

00:50:22.042 --> 00:50:25.792
Next time, we should do something smart.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.417
The crime and the criminal
should be at par.

00:50:29.958 --> 00:50:31.582
Have to match it.

00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:35.541
- Next time?
- Of course...

00:50:35.542 --> 00:50:37.792
Otherwise, what's the
point of the word serial?

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.083
Serial lawyer.
Not serial killer though.

00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:47.708
Are you... Are you really a lawyer?

00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:56.542
I really wanted to be a lawyer
but it didn't work out.

00:50:57.667 --> 00:51:03.624
I have loved the Law
since I was a kid.

00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:05.957
I've been reading law books as a boy.

00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:10.582
<i>While listening to his life story, I
realised that the man was absolutely crazy.</i>

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:15.541
<i>And I've unknowingly involved myself
in a crime with a criminal.</i>

00:51:15.542 --> 00:51:18.416
<i>Because no matter how much he argued
in defense of his mission...</i>

00:51:18.417 --> 00:51:22.792
<i>or he tried to prove what monsters
his chosen victims were...</i>

00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:26.417
<i>I couldn't forget,
even if I took everything else away...</i>

00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:29.708
<i>the innocent security guard.</i>

00:51:31.083 --> 00:51:33.417
Anyway, that's my story.

00:51:33.875 --> 00:51:35.958
No, I get it.

00:51:37.458 --> 00:51:42.291
But a lot of innocent people are affected
because of what you're doing.

00:51:42.292 --> 00:51:45.249
- It's not their fault...
- That's collateral damage.

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.083
There's some in every war.

00:51:48.708 --> 00:51:52.292
In any big war...
If you want to achieve something big...

00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:56.625
Happens all the time.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.249
It's an unrelated accident.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:04.583
Believe me, the guard,
the daughter's attempted suicide...

00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:08.542
These were absolutely unplanned surprises.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.292
But Shyamsundar is in jail.

00:52:13.708 --> 00:52:17.625
He's been destroying so many lives...

00:52:18.167 --> 00:52:20.167
Now, he can't anymore.

00:52:20.708 --> 00:52:21.708
Clear?

00:52:24.917 --> 00:52:26.250
Got it.

00:52:26.958 --> 00:52:28.958
But I don't know.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.708
I'm just an ordinary artiste.

00:52:32.083 --> 00:52:36.250
- I don't want to play God...
- You don't need to be God to punish Evil.

00:52:37.667 --> 00:52:39.458
You need Ubermenschen.

00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:44.542
When God is dead,
they fix things.

00:52:44.583 --> 00:52:47.083
What's right, what's wrong?

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:49.958
What's just, what's unjust?

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:53.458
Have you heard of Nietzsche?

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.083
Is he an international lawyer?

00:52:56.292 --> 00:52:58.000
Neither a lawyer nor an artiste.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.875
A philosopher.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.208
He came up with the term "Ubermensch".

00:53:04.375 --> 00:53:12.375
It means a powerful, talented,
sharp Superman...

00:53:14.083 --> 00:53:16.792
Man-made laws, rules, society...

00:53:17.917 --> 00:53:19.833
He's above it all.

00:53:20.083 --> 00:53:23.167
He decides he wants to commit a crime.

00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:26.332
No one will be able to catch him.

00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:27.458
He's so sharp.

00:53:29.583 --> 00:53:30.917
Just like me.

00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:38.000
You can do it too.

00:53:39.458 --> 00:53:44.666
But you'll have to perform your duties as a
talented artiste and a responsible citizen.

00:53:44.667 --> 00:53:46.042
Let's see who's next?

00:53:47.542 --> 00:53:49.917
<i>Manas Saha, minister's son.</i>

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.167
<i>He's killed people while driving drunk.</i>

00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:53.833
Who's going to match it?

00:53:54.458 --> 00:53:56.375
The artiste will match it.

00:53:57.375 --> 00:54:00.000
This is going to be Vinci Da's "Mona Lisa".

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.250
Ready?

00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:28.083
<i>But I'm an artiste.</i>

00:54:28.125 --> 00:54:31.207
<i>If my work benefits someone, great.</i>

00:54:31.208 --> 00:54:33.250
<i>But why should it harm someone?</i>

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.083
The Nobel Prize for peace...

00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:47.458
Do you know where Alfred Nobel
got that money from?

00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:53.250
By selling dynamite. Bombs. Explosive.

00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:57.125
What does that have to do with the artiste?

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.292
Let's start with your idol.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:06.625
Have you seen Leonardo's
designs of weapons?

00:55:06.958 --> 00:55:11.250
Those designs can annihilate millions
of people in seconds.

00:55:11.833 --> 00:55:13.833
Isn't that art?

00:55:14.542 --> 00:55:16.125
Isn't that science?

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:21.083
At least, the work you're doing
is helping a lot of people.

00:55:22.292 --> 00:55:24.875
It's hurting a few.

00:55:53.625 --> 00:56:01.250
Darling, what's wrong?

00:56:05.917 --> 00:56:09.041
What are you worried about?

00:56:09.042 --> 00:56:12.624
I think I'm trapped, Jaya.

00:56:12.625 --> 00:56:20.625
I don't know what I should do.
I've no idea.

00:56:22.708 --> 00:56:24.708
What happened?

00:56:27.375 --> 00:56:28.917
Tell me.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.457
I know that as a person you'll do the
right thing even if it's difficult.

00:56:40.458 --> 00:56:43.292
And as an artiste?

00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:52.083
- I don't get it. How is it different?
- It is different. Completely different.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:04.999
The rules of morality are not applicable
on artistes.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.666
Some famous artistes, writers, singers...

00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:13.666
Whatever their personal life might be...

00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:15.457
that's not people's concern.

00:57:15.458 --> 00:57:17.749
Ultimately, it's their work
that people remember.

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.166
That's what remains, Jaya.
Isn't it?

00:57:20.167 --> 00:57:22.291
Which singer is a wife-beater?

00:57:22.292 --> 00:57:24.832
Which bloody cricketer has taken bribes?

00:57:24.833 --> 00:57:26.749
Which actor is a womaniser?

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:29.207
No one remembers.

00:57:29.208 --> 00:57:33.832
No one wants to remember.

00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:36.041
What's the point?

00:57:36.042 --> 00:57:39.499
What are you talking about?

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.499
I can't understand anything.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:47.332
Before this, no one else
had given me such a huge opportunity.

00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:48.791
You know.

00:57:48.792 --> 00:57:53.541
It's not just the money
but the work is challenging.

00:57:53.542 --> 00:57:59.041
He's challenged the artiste within me.
No one has done that before.

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:02.249
This man gave me the opportunity
that the entire film industry couldn't.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:08.333
My makeup, my prosthetics, Jaya...

00:58:08.625 --> 00:58:11.333
How can I let that go?

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:18.624
He didn't do it on purpose.

00:58:18.625 --> 00:58:22.875
Actually, he was in such a rush...

00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:27.874
Even we make mistakes in a hurry.

00:58:27.875 --> 00:58:33.417
Maybe, he pulled the trigger by mistake.

00:58:34.042 --> 00:58:36.500
And the man just got in the way.

00:58:37.542 --> 00:58:45.542
Yeah, got it?
He didn't do it on purpose.

00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:13.958
I'll be with you,
no matter what you do.

00:59:30.542 --> 00:59:38.542
I'm very worried about something.

00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:42.124
What do you have to worry about?

00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:50.125
- If one of the parents...
- Stammer.

00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:57.375
- Will the child...
- Stammer too?

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:03.458
What?

01:00:06.208 --> 01:00:14.208
- I... Love... You...
- I love...

01:00:20.667 --> 01:00:24.208
Me too.

01:00:35.167 --> 01:00:42.458
<i>The gas balloons have floated away
The blue salons look away</i>

01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:47.792
<i>Tell me where should I go</i>

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:57.500
<i>I have lost my sleep
Maybe I should take some pills</i>

01:00:57.625 --> 01:01:02.792
<i>Tell me what should I do</i>

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:12.832
<i>Hug my craziness
Adorn the tramlines with poetry</i>

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:20.833
<i>My blunt sword lies in the pocket
Or empty it out at the next sale</i>

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:29.582
<i>Every time I am in your neighbourhood</i>

01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:36.208
<i>I gulp my discomfort down my throat</i>

01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:44.625
<i>As I walk down the steps of your dreams</i>

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:51.042
<i>That short, stout man stands in my way</i>

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:56.917
<i>You are chasing a dream.
There's no one like that.</i>

01:01:57.583 --> 01:01:59.083
<i>You've met all the girls.</i>

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.500
<i>I'm the only one left.</i>

01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:04.917
<i>You can look me up too.</i>

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:08.417
<i>It's not a dream, it's reality.</i>

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:49.458
<i>Candle lit dinners celebrating power cuts</i>

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:54.875
<i>Tell me should I come back for more</i>

01:02:57.125 --> 01:03:04.582
<i>The food is burning on the stove
Our drinks are fizzling out</i>

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:10.333
<i>Tell me which one we should save first</i>

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:19.749
<i>Hug my craziness
Adorn the tramlines with poetry</i>

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:27.374
<i>My blunt sword lies in the pocket
Or empty it out at the next sale</i>

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:34.500
<i>Every time I am in your neighbourhood</i>

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:43.125
<i>I gulp my discomfort down my throat</i>

01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:51.542
<i>As I walk down the steps of your dreams</i>

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:57.958
<i>That short, stout man stands in my way</i>

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:07.917
<i>The gas balloons have floated away
The blue salons look away</i>

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:16.083
<i>Tell me where should I go</i>

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:23.624
- Where's your driver, bro?
- I didn't call him.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:25.167
Hey, wait, wait, wait...

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:28.416
You said you're calling your driver.
Why did you cancel?

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:31.000
- Please don't drive.
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

01:04:32.292 --> 01:04:35.792
I can drive with one hand...

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:37.999
In fact, I drive better when I'm drunk.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.500
- Bro, it's already happened once...
- Get out of my way.

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:44.500
Why are you looking for trouble, bro?

01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:45.750
What did you just say?

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:49.207
Nothing... Why don't you give me the keys?

01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:50.875
I'll drop you home.

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:53.042
Why are you doing this?

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:57.417
Have you forgotten my name and my surname?

01:04:58.417 --> 01:05:00.250
Nothing ever happens to me.

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:01.708
What does that mean?

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:03.458
Nothing can happen to me.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.916
Bro, I have the best intentions in mind.

01:05:05.917 --> 01:05:08.916
Those girls are waiting for you.
Go ahead.

01:05:08.917 --> 01:05:12.583
Drive carefully, bro.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:15.375
- I'll drop you.
- Just shut up.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.000
Bro...

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:20.833
Bro, be careful...

01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:29.792
What the...

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:11.292
Hello, sir!
Sir?

01:06:13.167 --> 01:06:14.917
- Sir?
- Yeah.

01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:16.500
Do you need some help?

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:20.083
Yeah... Please come here.

01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:21.833
Please, please...

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:25.916
Thank you...
Bloody irresponsible people...

01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:28.042
- Wonder who does these...
- Very irresponsible...

01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:53.833
The party is not over yet.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:58.042
The party has just started...

01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:11.667
<i>It's the time to disco...</i>

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.208
Were you sleeping?

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:34.542
How did it go?

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:36.542
<i>It went according to the plan.</i>

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.167
<i>It was a good thing
you did the makeup on hands.</i>

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:41.333
<i>He was wearing a half sleeves shirt.</i>

01:09:42.958 --> 01:09:45.125
<i>This prosthetic thing...</i>

01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:47.417
<i>Even I don't know what happens to me.</i>

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.625
<i>I become a different person.</i>

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:51.833
<i>Your work is something else!</i>

01:09:52.542 --> 01:09:54.625
<i>Everything else was fine.</i>

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:57.000
Absolutely perfect.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:59.542
It's a such huge job,
there will be some hiccups.

01:09:59.625 --> 01:10:02.707
There could have been a big accident while
I was trying to drive into the divider.

01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:04.125
I could have died.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.875
I just drove over...

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:07.917
<i>He is a big guy.</i>

01:10:07.918 --> 01:10:11.625
I hurt my back, lifting him up.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.958
But that's okay.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:15.042
I had to block the road with bricks.

01:10:15.333 --> 01:10:16.750
It was a lot of hard work.

01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:20.457
The weight made it difficult.
I have a bad back.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:22.082
Otherwise, everything else was fine.

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:24.084
Wiping off the finger print
is a very tedious task.

01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:26.458
<i>I did that properly.</i>

01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:32.542
<i>The handles, the seats,
the steering wheel, the entire car...</i>

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
<i>I wiped everything down carefully.</i>

01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:38.333
<i>No one wears gloves while driving.</i>

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:41.958
<i>And the gloves will be
visible on the CCTV too.</i>

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.833
<i>It would have been a disaster.</i>

01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:45.958
<i>A complete disaster.</i>

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:53.542
Here's your advance for the next job.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.917
Buy the materials you need.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.458
I'll brief you in some
time about the next job.

01:10:57.542 --> 01:11:00.375
Hope the net wasn't visible.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:02.541
After all you've been through...

01:11:02.542 --> 01:11:04.541
Hopefully, the blending didn't come off.

01:11:04.542 --> 01:11:05.999
I used very good adhesive.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.208
That I don't know.

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:10.750
We'll get to know when the police watch
the CCTV footage on the big screen.

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:14.292
I just concentrated on the acting.

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:20.167
Hope no one was harmed this time.

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:24.292
Only one person was harmed.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.874
- Manas...
- Who's asking?

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:33.375
- Manas.
- Yeah.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:37.957
You have to wake up now, Manas.

01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:39.417
Who are you?

01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:44.542
I'm Poddar.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:46.542
DCDD Poddar.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.125
Sorry... Sorry, Inspector.

01:11:58.625 --> 01:11:59.833
Why am I here?

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.042
How did I get here?

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:09.166
You have run over five people while
driving under the influence of alcohol.

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:11.625
Then you passed out
after hitting a divider.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:15.125
Then some responsible citizens
dropped you off here.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.250
Actually, they didn't want to.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:19.292
They wanted to lynch you to death.

01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:21.458
My men rescued you.

01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:23.374
What the hell are you saying?

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:27.000
I couldn't have driven the car.
I was unconscious.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:33.208
A man... put a cloth on my mouth...

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.542
Believe me, I had to get off the car once.

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:46.625
How do you surround yourself
with criminals all the time?

01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:52.958
Last time, apparently your driver
ran over those people.

01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:58.542
This time some stranger had put you out...
You're really something!

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.583
You don't believe me.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.750
I need a lawyer
and I need him right now.

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:09.332
Of course.

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:11.124
We will call the lawyer
once you're conscious.

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:12.874
But I'm already in my senses.

01:13:12.875 --> 01:13:15.333
You're conscious now
but won't be 15 minutes later.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.625
Absolutely perfect.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.916
The way you got away with it last time...

01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:25.125
there's no guarantee that you won't get
away again, thanks to money and power.

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:27.833
But this time the evidence against you
is strong.

01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:30.375
There was a camera at the traffic signal.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:31.750
Camera?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Yes.

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:40.250
It might take time in court
to prove that the footage is not fake.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.167
That's why we're taking care of you now.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:45.542
You can't do this.

01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:47.583
You cannot...

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.083
Hey!

01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:51.625
Sit down!

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.583
You are...

01:14:01.875 --> 01:14:04.125
Have you read Aesop's Fables?

01:14:05.042 --> 01:14:07.208
Or have you only watched porn?

01:14:07.792 --> 01:14:11.375
Remember the boy who cried wolf?

01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:15.292
The shepherd...
who bluffed over and over again.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.708
Remember the end?

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.041
<i>This is the scene of a gruesome accident.</i>

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:27.332
<i>Five people sleeping on the pavement
have been run over.</i>

01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.249
<i>Police have cordorned off this area.</i>

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.416
<i>The bodies have been removed.</i>

01:14:31.417 --> 01:14:33.541
<i>An in depth investigation
is going on.</i>

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:38.416
<i>The CCTV footage from the traffic camera
is also being looked at.</i>

01:14:38.417 --> 01:14:42.499
<i>This is the CCTV footage
where Manas Saha can be clearly seen.</i>

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.875
<i>Common people have taken to the streets
in protest against this heinous incident.</i>

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.499
<i>He can't do whatever he wants
just because he's a politician's son.</i>

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.500
<i>We demand justice!</i>

01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:51.166
<i>This man should rot in jail.</i>

01:14:51.167 --> 01:14:53.749
<i>He got away with it last time.</i>

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.249
<i>He should be punished.</i>

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:57.917
<i>Down with Manas Saha!
We want justice!</i>

01:14:58.125 --> 01:15:00.916
<i>MLA Mrinmoy Saha insists
his son is innocent.</i>

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:02.542
<i>Here's what he had to say.</i>

01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:05.416
<i>- Your son has been accused before?
- He was proven innocent.</i>

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:06.582
<i>He'll be proved innocent again.</i>

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:09.166
<i>We have CCTV footage
that shows he is guilty.</i>

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:10.000
<i>It's fake.</i>

01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:14.457
<i>Even though, MLA Saha disagrees,
his son can be seen on the CCTV footage.</i>

01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:18.750
<i>Manas Saha got away last time
for the lack of evidence.</i>

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:21.333
<i>We have very strong evidence this time.</i>

01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:23.625
<i>That's why it'll be difficult for him.</i>

01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:25.124
<i>Easily IPC Section...</i>

<i>We're charging him
under all these sections.</i>

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.500
Good.

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:53.458
<i>Manas Saha is involved in a hit and
run case that killed five people.</i>

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:58.708
<i>He even tried to destroy
the traffic camera.</i>

01:15:58.958 --> 01:16:03.833
<i>Common people are protesting
the deaths of the poor people.</i>

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:06.457
<i>The police have blocked the area.</i>

01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:11.957
<i>The cyber forensic team is verifying
the authenticity of the CCTV footage.</i>

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:16.333
<i>This is the second time Manas Saha
is involved in a hit and run case.</i>

01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:20.958
<i>Manas Saha has been arrested.</i>

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:23.832
<i>He's being held for questioning
for the last 24 hours.</i>

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:28.625
<i>DCDD Poddar was unavailable
for comments.</i>

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:04.208
Sir, please buy some incense sticks.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.833
Please, sir.

01:17:07.042 --> 01:17:08.416
I don't want.

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:11.708
This is not a market.
This is an accident site.

01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:14.250
It's very cheap.
Please buy one.

01:17:16.458 --> 01:17:19.292
- How much is it for?
- Rs. 10.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.125
Take it.

01:17:42.292 --> 01:17:44.708
I bought your incense stick.
Why are you crying?

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:52.999
Someone drove a car over my father.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.417
It was really hot.
So, he had come to sleep here.

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:07.250
Hey, wait.

01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:15.208
Keep this.

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:19.333
Take this money.

01:18:20.167 --> 01:18:23.250
- Please take it.
- I don't want it. I don't need it.

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:25.708
Where do you live?

01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:39.083
Mom, this gentleman wanted to meet you.

01:18:43.792 --> 01:18:45.167
I...

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:49.917
Wanted to give him...

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.250
some money...

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:57.167
But he didn't want to take it.

01:18:58.792 --> 01:19:03.541
I wanted to give it to you...

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:04.667
Why?

01:19:04.792 --> 01:19:11.666
Because of the accident...

01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:14.500
I wanted to help...

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.292
We don't need your money.

01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:19.875
Please take some incense sticks
if you want.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.708
You can't say no.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.583
This is the last one.

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:51.500
We'll be done after that.

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:55.833
You have to work really hard
on this Saturday's makeup.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:01.542
- No.
- Look at you being all pricey.

01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:04.000
I know you're a great artiste.

01:20:04.542 --> 01:20:06.208
What do you want?

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:07.417
More money.

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:12.167
I don't want any money.
I'm not an artiste. I want nothing!

01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:18.291
How strange! The great Vinci Da is saying
he's not an artiste.

01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:20.292
What's wrong with you?

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:25.083
I can't kill any more.

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:32.542
Why are you so stressed out?

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:34.917
You're not the one kiling them.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.375
I'm killing them.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:42.333
Do you have a problem when an animal
is sacrificed at the altar of God?

01:20:45.167 --> 01:20:46.750
That's what this is.

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:48.875
This is sacrifice.

01:20:49.125 --> 01:20:53.625
How will we pacify the God of Law
without sacrifice?

01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:00.750
You are crazy.

01:21:01.542 --> 01:21:02.542
You are sick.

01:21:02.543 --> 01:21:04.750
You are mad!

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:09.832
Yes but there's a method
to the madness.

01:21:09.833 --> 01:21:12.916
If you continue your drama...

01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:17.208
I'll tell the cops that you're the
mastermind behind these crimes.

01:21:17.917 --> 01:21:19.832
It's a high profile case.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:23.250
My victims will be more than happy
to get a witness.

01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:27.416
There are no videos of me wearing
or taking off the masks.

01:21:27.417 --> 01:21:31.583
<i>But you're in videos making Shyamsundar
and Manas' masks.</i>

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:34.500
I have lots of videos.

01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:44.791
What's my fault?
Please let me go.

01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:46.666
Please let me go.

01:21:46.667 --> 01:21:52.542
I haven't harmed you.
Why are you doing this to me?

01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:56.833
This is the last case.

01:21:57.625 --> 01:21:59.458
That's it.

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:05.208
Time for "The Last Supper".

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:13.792
Please don't betray me
at the last moment like Judas.

01:22:14.042 --> 01:22:15.792
Please...

01:22:16.042 --> 01:22:19.083
After the job is done
I'll give you the videos.

01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:22.333
You can watch it on your day off.

01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:28.917
Reference.

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:32.458
<i>Sunny Sen, page three
celebrity, known rapist.</i>

01:22:39.917 --> 01:22:44.624
<i>Have you ever seen the eyes
of a listless, trapped mouse?</i>

01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:52.625
<i>It knows the moment the mouse trap
is opened like a reverse guillotine...</i>

01:22:53.458 --> 01:23:00.750
<i>Hundreds of crows will swoop in and relish
it's entrails like cheap roadside snack.</i>

01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:03.833
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:06.542
<i>There was nowhere to run.</i>

01:23:06.792 --> 01:23:11.375
<i>Either the cops will get me
or the crazy Adi Bose will kill me.</i>

01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:17.750
<i>Or I'll kill myself, guilty of having
innocent blood on my hands.</i>

01:23:18.083 --> 01:23:19.792
<i>But still...</i>

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:23.792
<i>Even though I'm telling the story
in this deep, sombre voice...</i>

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:27.542
<i>the story was being
written by someone else.</i>

01:23:28.083 --> 01:23:29.958
<i>The one who writes all the stories.</i>

01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:32.833
<i>The person sitting up above.</i>

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:36.249
Who are you?

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:39.125
Go away... Go away!

01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:41.457
Leave me alone...
I haven't done anything.

01:24:41.458 --> 01:24:43.999
Get out of here.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.791
I haven't killed anyone.
Why is there so much blood?

01:24:45.792 --> 01:24:49.917
Go away...
Get out!!!

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:52.250
I haven't killed anyone.

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:19.333
<i>How long has it been circulating?</i>

01:25:19.625 --> 01:25:20.957
Since yesterday.

01:25:20.958 --> 01:25:22.582
Have you searched Sunny Sen's home?

01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:23.750
Yes, sir.

01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:25.875
We've found a lot of discriminating videos.

01:25:26.083 --> 01:25:30.291
He has filmed himself too.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.707
The man is mentally disturbed.
He's psychotic.

01:25:32.708 --> 01:25:34.417
He's disgusting.

01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:37.792
Bring it to me on a pen drive.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.917
Go on.

01:25:42.583 --> 01:25:46.000
Sir... I have it.

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:50.000
Someone forwarded it.
Would you like to take a look?

01:26:05.375 --> 01:26:06.875
Who sent it to you?

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:14.375
One of my college friends...

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.792
Ask the bugger to come here.

01:26:22.917 --> 01:26:25.542
Let me introduce him to the Cyber cell.

01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:30.208
And please don't call disgusting people
like these your friends.

01:26:31.125 --> 01:26:34.458
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble too.
Understood?

01:26:35.417 --> 01:26:36.791
Understood?

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:40.250
- Yes, sir.
- Get out. Get out!

01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:46.416
And delete that video!

01:26:46.417 --> 01:26:49.957
<i>I heard Sunny Sen got very badly beaten up
in the lock up.</i>

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:55.167
<i>Apparently, some of his nerves
were permanently damaged.</i>

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.417
<i>But he got out on bail.
Thanks to his contacts.</i>

01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:04.000
<i>Although, by then his personal life
was already falling apart.</i>

01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:07.333
<i>Sunny's father-in-law
was a very influential man.</i>

01:27:07.375 --> 01:27:13.458
<i>Sunny's wife filed for divorce
and took full custody of his children.</i>

01:27:14.292 --> 01:27:16.417
<i>This case was pending already.</i>

01:27:16.792 --> 01:27:21.249
<i>Although, his lawyer tried to prove
that the videos were fake...</i>

01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:23.166
<i>forensics found no proof
in support of the claim.</i>

01:27:23.167 --> 01:27:27.375
<i>Adi Bose destroyed Sunny Sen's life.</i>

01:27:27.917 --> 01:27:33.417
<i>Unknowingly, he had destroyed another life.</i>

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.917
<i>Mine.</i>

01:27:38.333 --> 01:27:42.917
I'm so happy that you've finally come home.

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:48.208
You don't look like someone
who parties a lot.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:52.083
An occasional drink for the artiste.
That's it.

01:27:53.292 --> 01:27:56.582
I don't go out much.

01:27:56.583 --> 01:27:58.167
Work keeps me busy.

01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:00.667
But it's a special occasion.

01:28:00.917 --> 01:28:03.083
- And your list...
- No formalities, please...

01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:07.333
Right... Your list is done.

01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:09.750
And I'm done too.

01:28:09.958 --> 01:28:13.083
It's over...
All the work.

01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:16.500
So, I was saying...

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.958
- So?
- That...

01:28:19.417 --> 01:28:23.417
If I can get the videos and photos...

01:28:24.292 --> 01:28:26.375
I mean...

01:28:27.625 --> 01:28:31.208
You know I thought about it a lot.

01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:34.250
It's safe with me.

01:28:37.417 --> 01:28:41.833
I'll keep it like a memento.

01:28:46.875 --> 01:28:50.125
Only the prosthetic list is over.

01:28:50.375 --> 01:28:53.000
But the list of criminals is long.

01:28:53.292 --> 01:28:54.916
There's so much more to do.

01:28:54.917 --> 01:28:57.249
You're done but I'm not.

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:59.417
There's so much more to do.

01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:02.792
The laws...

01:29:04.542 --> 01:29:09.125
So many people are breaking the law
and getting away with it.

01:29:09.458 --> 01:29:11.957
Let's say you suddenly get mad at me.

01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:14.708
And you take a trip to the police station.

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:21.708
And one story might lead to another...

01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:27.500
Then, my "Clean Society Mission"
will be in danger.

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:29.083
So, let it be with me.

01:29:31.292 --> 01:29:32.500
What's this?

01:29:38.292 --> 01:29:40.083
Like you said...

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:41.750
Memento.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:49.458
I bought it from a little boy
on the streets.

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:52.166
You burn incense while drinking?

01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:55.542
Is that some strange artiste's ritual?

01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:06.375
That girl who...

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.041
Did you know her?

01:30:08.042 --> 01:30:11.375
No, random.
I picked up the first girl I saw.

01:30:12.458 --> 01:30:14.917
Not someone I knew.

01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:23.375
Collateral damage...
I told you.

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:27.167
- Collateral...
- Yeah, collateral damage.

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:32.125
What about Sunny Sen's lawyer?

01:30:32.208 --> 01:30:37.374
What if he orders for medical tests?

01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:40.500
The marks are still there.

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:44.707
He can prove that it wasn't Sunny Sen.

01:30:44.708 --> 01:30:45.500
What happens then?

01:30:45.501 --> 01:30:48.667
There'll be a lot of trouble.

01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:55.500
I use gloves when I murder someone.

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:59.249
I used a condom when I raped the girl.

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:00.958
Condom?

01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:06.167
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:07.917
Are you okay?

01:31:09.083 --> 01:31:10.375
Okay?

01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:16.666
My drink is a little too stiff.
Can I get some water?

01:31:16.667 --> 01:31:19.750
- Water?
- It's over.

01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:21.917
I'll get it right away.

01:31:33.083 --> 01:31:35.542
Why did you ask me to meet here?

01:31:36.708 --> 01:31:38.625
What are you doing?

01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:42.750
What's that?

01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:46.917
Have you lost your mind?

01:31:47.417 --> 01:31:51.125
What do you want me to see?

01:31:51.458 --> 01:31:53.000
What do you have on your mobile...

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:19.750
This is an accident.

01:32:20.125 --> 01:32:23.541
How is it your fault?

01:32:23.542 --> 01:32:26.750
Accidents happen.

01:32:30.167 --> 01:32:33.749
Jaya, this is not your fault.

01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:37.000
This video is an accident, Jaya.

01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:41.041
This is an accident!

01:32:41.042 --> 01:32:48.583
Then why are people blaming me?
Everyone...

01:32:50.708 --> 01:32:52.416
What am I going to do now?

01:32:52.417 --> 01:32:53.817
Why are you giving them importance?

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.500
You don't have to pay attention
to what people say.

01:33:00.167 --> 01:33:03.374
They're idiots
if they think it's your fault.

01:33:03.375 --> 01:33:08.417
If anyone looks at you,
I'll blind them.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.374
Please calm down.

01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:13.833
Where are you going?

01:33:14.417 --> 01:33:15.707
I'm asking you to stop.

01:33:15.708 --> 01:33:18.667
Stop! What are you doing?

01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:22.249
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:23.833
What was in your hand?

01:33:24.458 --> 01:33:26.417
Jaya!

01:33:27.542 --> 01:33:32.375
I don't want to live anymore.

01:33:32.875 --> 01:33:35.957
I want to die...

01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:39.708
Have you gone mad?
Why do you want to die?

01:33:40.167 --> 01:33:43.042
People don't remember these things.
They forget.

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:47.708
It's just going to be you and me.
Just us.

01:33:48.208 --> 01:33:53.500
We'll live with our heads held high, Jaya.

01:33:53.708 --> 01:33:58.874
I will always respect you.

01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:04.333
Your body has nothing
to do with your honour.

01:34:04.542 --> 01:34:08.125
We'll go somewhere far away.

01:34:09.292 --> 01:34:12.832
Why should you cry?
Why should you be ashamed?

01:34:12.833 --> 01:34:16.082
Why should you pay for the crime
you didn't commit?

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:21.458
The criminal will be punished.

01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:52.542
Sir, this is an open and shut case.

01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:54.916
That's what the video evidence is saying.

01:35:54.917 --> 01:35:58.167
- He had a criminal record, right?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:59.375 --> 01:36:03.750
He was psychologically damaged.
Murdered his father as a boy.

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:10.375
There are fingerprints on the glass.
His laptop is at the cyber forensic cell.

01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:18.167
- Everything is okay but...
- But what, sir?

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:21.667
I've seen this man before.

01:36:22.333 --> 01:36:23.917
He looks familiar.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:25.791
- Where?
- At the police station.

01:36:25.792 --> 01:36:27.625
At the police station?

01:36:30.042 --> 01:36:34.416
Oh! I remember now!

01:36:34.417 --> 01:36:39.083
I met him at your station.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.666
- Bapi, you were there too.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:48.125
That... Pickpocket...
Beaten up by the mob...

01:36:48.375 --> 01:36:49.167
Remember, Bapi?

01:36:49.168 --> 01:36:50.291
Yes, sir.

01:36:50.292 --> 01:36:51.958
Right, sir. He was there.

01:36:52.417 --> 01:36:58.875
He went on about Law
like a mad man.

01:36:59.417 --> 01:37:01.083
Mad man.

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:04.375
But Law comes before everyone, sir.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.208
Life and death are secondary.

01:37:06.583 --> 01:37:10.250
The confession confirms the mental illness.

01:37:12.417 --> 01:37:14.750
Something isn't adding up.

01:37:16.208 --> 01:37:18.917
Something is out of place.

01:37:24.667 --> 01:37:26.124
What's wrong with you?

01:37:26.125 --> 01:37:27.583
Is everything okay?

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:30.042
Okay?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.207
My drink is a little too stiff.
Can I get some water?

01:37:36.208 --> 01:37:39.125
- Water?
- Yeah, it's over.

01:37:39.833 --> 01:37:41.500
I'll get it right away.

01:38:16.875 --> 01:38:23.208
Vinci Da, don't know what I would do
without you.

01:38:24.083 --> 01:38:26.875
I wouldn't be able to become
a successful lawyer.

01:38:28.667 --> 01:38:32.707
- Lawyer?
- Yes, lawyer.

01:38:32.708 --> 01:38:34.500
What do lawyers do?

01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:40.875
Lawyers bring criminals to justice.

01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:43.625
That's what I do.

01:38:45.083 --> 01:38:48.833
My friends used to play cops and crooks.

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:51.500
I went a step further.

01:38:52.042 --> 01:38:57.125
Crooks... Cops...
Lawyer.

01:38:58.708 --> 01:39:02.000
Needless to say,
I would play the lawyer.

01:39:02.833 --> 01:39:05.832
Everything must be taken to court.

01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:07.500
We used to play a game too.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.125
Crooks and cops?

01:39:11.208 --> 01:39:13.042
A little more than that.

01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:16.667
Crooks, cops and lawyer?

01:39:17.792 --> 01:39:22.125
Ubermenschen think alike.

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:24.375
A little more.

01:39:29.667 --> 01:39:31.125
What's that?

01:39:32.292 --> 01:39:35.207
Crooks, cops, lawyer...

01:39:35.208 --> 01:39:38.000
Judge and Executioner.

01:39:41.917 --> 01:39:45.042
- Which character did you play?
- Double role.

01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:48.542
Judge and Executioner.

01:41:03.875 --> 01:41:05.833
I am Adi Bose.

01:41:07.833 --> 01:41:10.042
In sound mind...

01:41:10.792 --> 01:41:13.042
Without any provocation from anyone...

01:41:14.583 --> 01:41:16.917
is committing suicide.

01:41:20.083 --> 01:41:25.917
The only one responsible
for my death is me...

01:41:27.333 --> 01:41:29.958
and my guilt.

01:41:33.375 --> 01:41:38.000
I've always been unhappy.

01:41:38.958 --> 01:41:44.000
That's why I wanted everyone else
to be unhappy too.

01:41:45.875 --> 01:41:48.375
I've killed many people.

01:41:49.917 --> 01:41:51.792
I've tortured many more.

01:41:52.417 --> 01:41:54.333
I didn't even spare my father.

01:41:57.125 --> 01:42:01.625
I'm mentally ill.

01:42:04.125 --> 01:42:06.833
I'm a threat to the society.

01:42:09.042 --> 01:42:10.917
That's why...

01:42:12.667 --> 01:42:14.750
I'll get going now.

01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:24.250
<i>Gold's price is increasing.</i>

01:44:24.251 --> 01:44:30.582
<i>And to talk about it
we have the "Golden Man of India".</i>

01:44:30.583 --> 01:44:34.083
<i>What can I say about myself?</i>

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:35.582
I'm Adi Bose.

01:44:35.583 --> 01:44:36.167
Adi Bose.

01:44:36.168 --> 01:44:39.624
<i>She took them home...</i>

01:44:39.625 --> 01:44:40.625
The voice.

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:44.750
- It's the voice... The voice...
- What, sir?

01:44:46.625 --> 01:44:47.749
- Bapi?
- Yes, sir?

01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:51.125
- Have you scanned the victim's laptop?
- In process.

01:44:52.875 --> 01:44:54.832
Turn the car around!

01:44:54.833 --> 01:44:57.375
- Hurry up.
- Now!

01:44:59.917 --> 01:45:04.499
Hello, have you traced the chip?

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.124
I need the IP address.

01:45:07.125 --> 01:45:12.417
Yes, the mobile's IP address.
Keep me updated.

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:26.624
- Bapi, take a print of this.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:26.625 --> 01:45:28.082
Make a poster
and put it up all across the city.

01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:31.083
- Get it done now!
- Okay, sir.

01:45:44.417 --> 01:45:45.917
Can I see your ticket?

01:45:52.167 --> 01:45:53.375
Tickets?

01:45:55.458 --> 01:45:57.792
Ma'am, show me your ticket.

01:46:06.292 --> 01:46:08.125
Where are you going?

01:46:11.542 --> 01:46:13.958
Jabbalpur.

01:46:14.917 --> 01:46:21.417
<i>Stop fidgeting and look at me</i>

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:26.875
<i>What do you feel like doing?
What do you want?</i>

01:46:28.583 --> 01:46:35.167
<i>Tell me about your experiences</i>

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:41.874
<i>What has life taught you?</i>

01:46:41.875 --> 01:46:48.833
<i>The colours of the grass is bursting
The smell of the wet earth is calling</i>

01:46:49.167 --> 01:46:57.167
<i>Close your eyes and breathe it all in</i>

01:46:58.125 --> 01:47:06.125
<i>Calm down, calm down, calm down</i>

01:47:41.042 --> 01:47:47.583
<i>Stand under the piercing sunlight</i>

01:47:47.875 --> 01:47:54.125
<i>Only silence all around</i>

01:47:54.708 --> 01:48:00.792
<i>Your identity melts away in thin air</i>

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:08.000
<i>But don't lose your self</i>

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:14.833
<i>People who have written your epitaph</i>

01:48:15.250 --> 01:48:21.667
<i>They don't know the whole story</i>

01:48:22.083 --> 01:48:28.208
<i>When you hear the call of the skies</i>

01:48:28.667 --> 01:48:36.667
<i>Don't give it all away</i>

01:48:39.250 --> 01:48:47.250
<i>Calm down, calm down, calm down</i>

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:28.250
<i>Stop fidgeting and look at me</i>

01:49:28.583 --> 01:49:35.208
<i>What do you feel like doing?
What do you want?</i>

01:49:35.458 --> 01:49:42.416
<i>The colours of the grass is bursting
The smell of the wet earth is calling</i>

01:49:42.417 --> 01:49:50.417
<i>Close your eyes and breathe it all in</i>

01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:59.250
<i>Calm down, calm down, calm down</i>
