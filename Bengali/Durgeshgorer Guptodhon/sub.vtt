WEBVTT

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:12.124
April 15, 1756.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:16.500
Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah
ascended the throne of Bengal.

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:21.458
In Murshidabad, the air was thick
with conspiracy.

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:23.875
A cloud of distrust loomed large.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:28.833
The prime conspirator was his
commander-in-chief, Mir Jafar Ali Khan.

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:37.041
Siraj had the support of Jagat Seth,
Bengal's richest businessman.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.624
But calamity struck when Siraj,
in a fit of rage

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.916
slapped Jagat Seth in open court.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:49.875
The enraged Jagat Seth decided
to join the conspirator's camp.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.499
He convinced them

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.999
to bring about a major change,
they needed

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.250
his insightful and intelligent friend,
Krishna Chandra Roy.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:05.625
Maharaja Krishna Chandra Roy
was the ruler of Krishnanagar.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:13.041
To avenge his friend,
he agreed to be a discreet adviser.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:22.291
June 23, 1757.
The battlefield of Plassey.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.916
Lord Clive defeated Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah.

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:56.583
Jagat Seth rewarded Krishna Chandra
with gold and precious stones.

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.749
Mir Jafar ascended
the throne of Bengal.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.040
In 1760, Mir Jafar's son-in-law, Mir Qasim
succeeded him on the throne.

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:12.583
Mir Qasim chanced upon a few letters
that Jagat Seth had written to Clive.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:19.291
Mir Qasim suspected a conspiracy brewing
against him.

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:21.040
To secure his position

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:27.375
he murdered Jagat Seth
by throwing him in the Ganges.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.125
Krishna Chandra was alarmed.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.125
The wealth that he had received
from Jagat Seth

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:41.333
he distributed it amongst his close friends
for safekeeping.

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:44.833
As expected, Krishna Chandra
was taken prisoner.

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:47.750
Lord Clive intervened.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:54.000
Mir Qasim had to release Krishna Chandra
under Clive's pressure.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.749
Once released, Krishna Chandra
was a transformed soul.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.290
Under him Bengal witnessed
a cultural revolution.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:14.249
The righteous king never looked back

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.125
at his hidden treasures.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:25.458
And with passing time, the hidden treasures
of Krishna Chandra were forgotten forever.

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:36.083
THE HIDDEN TREASURE
OF DURGESHGARH

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:54.791
Keep it carefully.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.208
Are you from Bonpukuriya?

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.000
Let's go. Not that way.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:38.500
This way.

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:06.375
Help me up.
This way...

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.041
Run.

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:32.708
Run!

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:16.125
Happy birthday, Jhinuk.

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.666
- Thank you, Sona'da.
- Welcome.

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:19.750
You are here as well?

00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:21.832
Yeah, he told me it was urgent.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.374
He asked me to drop everything
and come.

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:24.791
So where is...

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:28.208
Right here, Sona'da.
Jhinuk.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:35.125
Aabir Lal Roy is not just a man of words
but a man of deeds too.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.875
Follow me.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.791
Wait... What are you doing, Aabir?

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:47.083
Aabir, what are you up to?
Just look at him.

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:50.791
What's going on?

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.458
Aabir!

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:00.290
Aabir, don't do this.
You can't swim.

00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:01.666
Don't do it.

00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:03.166
Aabir, please.

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:07.000
Sona'da! Aabir!

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.875
Hello...

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.291
He's outdone himself.

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:27.375
On your birthday, there can't be
a better surprise gift.

00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:30.625
You knew about this?

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:32.916
Who me?

00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.333
Well done, my boy! Great job!
Now get out of the pool.

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:43.833
Thank you.

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:47.833
Happy?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.082
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:51.291
Surprise.

00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:53.083
Happy birthday!

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:54.416
Thank you.

00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:57.125
Too many calories burned.

00:08:57.208 --> 00:08:59.125
Now some calories to be earned.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.458
Didn't I promise you, I'll learn to swim
after we got back from Manikantapur.

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:10.250
Did you come here
to swim or to eat?

00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:12.684
Do you know how many calories are burnt
while swimming?

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:15.625
Swimming is for physical strength
and food is for mental strength.

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:19.500
So much for snacks?

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:22.124
Are you skipping her birthday dinner?

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:23.874
That's dinner.
This is just a snack.

00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:25.208
Jhinuk...

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:26.750
Your tea.

00:09:26.751 --> 00:09:27.957
Inspector Sarkar?

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.500
- From Manikantapur?
- Yes.

00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:33.833
Hello. Of course, I recognise you.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:34.958
How are you?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.832
Sweet memories rush back...

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:38.875
Tell me.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.249
Any problem?

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.333
- What's the problem?
- Quiet... Yeah.

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:50.540
I'll be at Aabir's place
in the evening.

00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:51.582
- Ask him to come.
- Tonight?

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:53.125
Why don't you join us?

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.416
Everyone will be there.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.291
Today is Jhinuk's birthday.

00:09:57.583 --> 00:09:59.916
I'll text you the address.
Okay.

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:03.333
It's just us.
Don't worry about confidentiality.

00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:06.083
Confidential!

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.750
Let's talk when we meet.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:11.832
Confidential information is shared
with someone you're confident with.

00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:12.953
- Isn't it, Aabir?
- Exactly!

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Brutus!

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.833
Sona'da, you didn't ask
about Semonti Sarkar?

00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:19.957
How's the research on Islamic history?

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.415
Have the spellings improved?

00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:25.332
Inspector Sarkar had called to show me
an important and confidential object.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.083
That's it.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:29.457
"Maybe the thought of marriage
has crossed your mind?"

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:32.666
That's why you've invited her dad
for dinner.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.208
What are you doing?

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:41.290
Guess who Sona'da has invited?

00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:42.291
- Who?
- Who?

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.415
Inspector Sarkar.

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:47.332
Has he been transferred to Calcutta
from Manikantapur?

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.666
He had called.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.458
He wants to share something confidential
with Sona'da.

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.040
Aabir, is it another mystery?

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:55.958
There's mystery in History.

00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:58.624
Mystery in History?

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:02.915
Isn't Sarkar's daughter
Sona's student from Oxford?

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.207
Semonti Sarkar.

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:07.791
Great student. Good handwriting.
Horrible spelling mistakes.

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:11.665
- Welcome, Professor Sen.
- Please come in.

00:11:11.666 --> 00:11:16.125
- Welcome, Mr. Sarkar. Please come in.
- Hello. Please sit.

00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:19.040
- How are you?
- I am well.

00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:22.083
Brother, your son is becoming
a nitwit.

00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:24.915
Sona'da, what book did you get me?

00:11:24.916 --> 00:11:26.166
What a greedy girl!

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:28.540
Who asks for a birthday gift like this?

00:11:28.541 --> 00:11:33.166
Since, the custom of gifting books
has almost been done away with...

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.665
Being greedy in this case is a good thing.

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:35.874
That's right.

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:38.833
But first a special birthday gift.

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:40.083
Wow!

00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.000
Okay, happy birthday
to you once again.

00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:46.642
- How many gifts did you get?
- Wow!

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:47.946
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.790
'Parbani'?

00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:51.351
It's the first children's
festive periodical.

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:53.082
Created by the pioneer Rabindranath Tagore.

00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:55.624
Really? I had no idea.
Come, sit here.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:59.000
In 1918, Tagore asked his son-in-law
to start the magazine.

00:11:59.041 --> 00:11:59.583
Alright!

00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:02.665
- So, it's been 100 years.
- That means this is an antique.

00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:03.874
Wow!

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.790
Jhinuk, many happy returns
of the day.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:07.874
- More gifts?
- Thank you!

00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:09.083
That's a book too.

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:11.250
I've made up my mind.

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:19.375
I'll ask all the guests to gift only books
on Aabir and Jhinuk's wedding.

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:23.993
Please attach a list of books
with the invitation card.

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:25.541
So that there are no repeats.

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:28.915
Let's cut the cake.

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.207
Then we will take.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.416
Jyotsna, is the food ready?

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:37.499
Everything from the appetizers
to dessert is ready.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.666
I'll serve the moment you're ready.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.708
The cake is ready too.

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:48.708
Jyostna, this is the best life!

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:51.375
Sit down.

00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.125
My name is Kalnemi Kundu.

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:56.125
It was a difficult robbery.

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.726
How can you leave that dagger behind?

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.250
How could you just drop it?

00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:02.083
Stealing is an art.

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:03.957
You've learnt nothing.

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.791
You have no dedication
towards your work.

00:13:05.875 --> 00:13:09.374
- Kalu, that's very cold.
- Isn't it?

00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:14.916
- I want you to feel the chill.
- No, please don't...

00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:23.083
Hello, sir.
What are you saying?

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:26.916
Where do we have to go?
We'll be right there. Okay, sir.

00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:30.958
Lyata, listen carefully.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.874
We have to go to Ballygunge now.

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:34.333
That policeman is headed there.

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.749
The dagger is in the brown bag
he's carrying.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.875
Our boss has an informer
in the police too.

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:48.874
Happy birthday to you!

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:52.583
Happy birthday, dear Jhinuk!

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.999
Happy birthday to you!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.874
Jhinuk, cake is a delicious food item,
not a face cream.

00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:00.875
Is that so?

00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:02.791
Dad...

00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:10.500
You'll get it.

00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:11.750
- Sona'da...
- No, no, no...

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.457
His face looks like a volcano
ready to erupt.

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:14.375
Give it to him first.

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:16.000
Want some cake, Aabir?

00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:18.458
Well done!

00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:20.915
Jhinuk, you're still such a child!

00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:23.332
It's okay.
Just a few more days.

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.249
No time to be a child anymore
after she gets married.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.457
- Really, Aunty?
- Please explain.

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.434
I won't be able behave like a kid
after I'm married?

00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:30.165
- Aabir, then the wedding is cancelled.
- Oh, no! What?

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:31.832
No, not at all.

00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:32.833
Rai...

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.540
Please stay the way you are.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.040
Mom, don't say like that.

00:14:37.041 --> 00:14:38.249
The wedding menu is already fixed.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.059
If the wedding is cancelled,
who'll eat all the food?

00:14:40.083 --> 00:14:44.375
Nephew, are you getting married
so you can eat?

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:45.208
Yeah...

00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:46.833
Here, have some cake.

00:14:53.083 --> 00:14:54.083
Want an icecream?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.250
Wow! This is an antique!

00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:00.832
Might belong to royalty.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.333
- Can I see the cover?
- Of course.

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:05.250
The design is on the surface.

00:15:05.251 --> 00:15:06.290
What's inside?

00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:08.708
The way Jhinuk writes her name
on her books

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:12.915
in those days, kings would inscribe
their names inside the cover.

00:15:12.916 --> 00:15:17.083
Mehtab Chand, 1165.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.540
- 1165?
- 12th century?

00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:21.833
I think it's 1165 Hijri.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:26.082
So, it'll be 1756.

00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:28.207
18th century...
That's no less antique.

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:30.875
I see another name... here.

00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:34.166
Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:39.666
I secured this after tracking
a smuggling network for a while.

00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:42.374
I suspect there's a big racket
working behind it.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:45.749
Fill your own pockets by selling
nation's heritage.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.749
This kind of negligence
can only be seen in our country.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.790
What can I say?

00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:52.124
Such royalty won't suit you people.

00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:53.541
- Let me see it.
- Here goes...

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.875
Mehtab Chand.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.499
Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.124
One dagger, two owners.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.000
Careful.

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:04.540
Sona, why two names?

00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:07.291
I think the dagger belonged
to Mehtab Chand.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:11.040
Either he gave it to Durgagoti
or Durgagoti Deb Roy...

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:12.625
Nabbed it?

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:18.541
The name Mehtab Chand
sounds very familiar.

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:19.832
But Durgagoti...

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:23.457
That's exactly why
I brought it to you.

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.207
Only you'll understand
the true value of this.

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:26.291
I'll try.

00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:28.750
- Aabir, let me take a photo of you.
- Here, take it.

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:32.875
- Careful...
- With the dagger.

00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:34.583
Stand properly.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.125
- What happened?
- What's all this?

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:43.250
Head towards the dining table everyone!

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:44.874
We'll have a candelit dinner tonight!

00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:47.499
Aunty, I love you!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.541
Sona, what did I say?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:56.625
Some of us behave like a child
even after 25 years of marriage.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.916
We're keeping an eye, sir.

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:00.333
Yes.

00:17:00.916 --> 00:17:02.516
We'll follow him
the moment he comes out.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.291
Brown bag, right?
Yes, sir.

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:06.875
Photo?

00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:10.166
Okay, sir... Okay...
I'll check.

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:15.625
Thank God!
I don't have night duty today.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.082
Aabir, hope you're enjoying the meal.

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:20.083
Sona'da, please...

00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:21.166
- Finish eating.
- Actually...

00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:24.832
Mom and Jyotsna might feel
they've cooked in vain if I don't finish.

00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:27.750
Hey, no one will feel bad.
Enough eating. Get up now!

00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:30.916
Looks like he is starting dinner
all over again.

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.083
Can't I get some more...

00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:33.375
Whose birthday is it?

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:36.249
You showed us something
priceless today!

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.010
I'm sure you'll begin
your investigation now.

00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:40.958
Yes... Will have to search through reports
of missing artefacts.

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:43.375
- It'll be in police custody now.
- Absolutely.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.458
- Goodbye.
- Good night.

00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:46.333
Thank you for the treat.

00:17:46.334 --> 00:17:48.750
- Sona, please see him off.
- Of course.

00:17:49.041 --> 00:17:50.250
Take care.

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:52.625
Kalu...

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.000
Lets go.

00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:02.708
Let's go.

00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.541
- Be here on time tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:10.041
Hey! Hey! Stop! Police!
Force! Police! Force! Hey!

00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:18.458
It's not there?

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:23.041
It's not in the bag.
We checked thoroughly, sir.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.625
It'll be in police custody
for two days?

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.958
Syata? But he works with the police.

00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:35.375
Oh, he's your part-time informer?

00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.541
Bishtu Karmakar?

00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:39.208
Oh!

00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:41.500
We'll get it done.
Please send me the photo.

00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:44.125
Okay, sir.

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:47.790
Boss is a genius!

00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.582
Guess what boss said right now?

00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:52.999
He is planning to replace
the original dagger with a fake one.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.040
Can you imagine?

00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:57.165
People become smarter
once they've been abroad.

00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:59.000
- Want to go abroad?
- No, too cold.

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:18.291
- Bishtu?
- What?

00:20:20.708 --> 00:20:22.332
Need it in two days.

00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:25.250
This? In two days?

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:26.458
Boss' orders.

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:31.083
Otherwise, the consequences
will be fatal.

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:35.083
We'll be back in two days.
Two days.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.458
Tell me.

00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:54.750
What? When did it happen?

00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:56.458
Yes...

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:00.665
Oh thank God!

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:05.916
Mr. Sarkar, you should make arrangements
to send it to the museum.

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:10.290
The director himself is on leave?

00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:17.333
What else?
Please keep it safely with you.

00:21:17.541 --> 00:21:20.791
No, it's alright.
Okay, good night.

00:21:33.541 --> 00:21:35.332
Maharaja Krishna Chandra Roy.

00:21:35.333 --> 00:21:37.207
What makes him a famous king?

00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:38.790
His famous court consisting
of nine wise men.

00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:41.125
- Just like King Vikramaditya's court.
- Correct.

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:43.957
Sir, he was the patron
of great poet, Bharat Chandra Roy.

00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:45.790
- 'Annada Mangal Kavya'.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:48.124
Sir, he had a dark side too.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:51.332
In the Battle of Plassey,
he stood for Robert Clive and not Siraj.

00:21:51.333 --> 00:21:53.332
This topic warrants discussion.

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:57.124
While I'm discussing the history
of Bengal's famous Durga festival

00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:00.333
why are we remembering
Krishna Chandra Roy?

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:02.957
Many believe that

00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:07.040
although Bengal's Durga festival was started
by Raja Jagat Ram Roy in the 14th century

00:22:07.041 --> 00:22:11.374
it was Maharaja Krishna Chandra Roy
who started the present version of it.

00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:12.767
What do you mean by present version, sir?

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:15.624
Define the form and structure
of the Durga idol as you know.

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:17.499
Goddess Durga in the middle.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.749
Laxmi and Ganesha on her right
and Saraswati and Kartik on her left.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.665
- The entire family appears together.
- Right.

00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:25.083
The form was not like this before.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.625
It used to be only Goddess Durga's
demon slaying avatar.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.415
The family structure got added
to the demon slaying story.

00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:38.707
This format of the Durga festival was
popularized in Bengal by Krishna Chandra Roy.

00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:39.874
Sir, did you know

00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:44.082
Krishna Chandra visited
Dumble's ancestral home?

00:22:44.083 --> 00:22:46.040
- Tell him...
- Really?

00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:48.458
The elders in the family talk about it.

00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:51.000
- Where's your ancestral home?
- Bonpukuriya.

00:22:58.083 --> 00:23:00.375
- Your bag.
- Just one second, sir, please.

00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:05.750
- Sir, please come for the festival!
- Quiet.

00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:07.290
Sir, I'm serious.
Please come.

00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:08.499
You'll love the Durga festival
at my ancestral home.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.416
Bonpukuriya?

00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:11.582
It's not too far.
Just a three hour drive.

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.708
It sounds very tempting.

00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:17.082
- But I won't be travelling alone...
- Jhinuk and Aabir will come too?

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:17.958
That's great, sir!

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:20.375
You know them too?

00:23:20.416 --> 00:23:21.707
Of course, I do.

00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:23.499
Who can forget the trio's discovery
of Shah Shuja's hidden treasure?

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.415
It's decided then.
It'll be a lot of fun.

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:26.624
Okay, let me plan it out.

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:29.957
I was just thinking about
your elaborate name...

00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:31.582
Domburopani Deb Roy.

00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:34.499
Why such a serious name?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.290
Since we celebrate the festival at home...

00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:38.708
We're all named after Goddess Durga
or Lord Shiva.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.708
Please explain.

00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:43.333
My elder brother is Dr. Pinakpani Deb Roy.

00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:45.833
My second brother's name
is Trishulpani Deb Roy.

00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:49.041
He lives in the US.
He'll be here during the festival.

00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:51.291
Deb Roy?

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:52.999
Dumble, if you don't mind...

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.958
Is Durgagoti Deb Roy related
to your family?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.833
Yes, sir! How did you know?

00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:59.332
He's one of my forefathers.

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:01.249
We call him "Buro Thakurda Moshai",
Old Grandpa.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.207
Krishna Chandra had visited
during his time.

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.625
That's when the festival started.

00:24:04.666 --> 00:24:09.041
In fact, many say, Krishna Chandra
insisted Old Grandpa to start the festival.

00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:10.707
- Can I show you something, sir?
- Let's see.

00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:12.250
There's news about my family.

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:17.708
Old Grandpa's dagger
has been stolen from our home.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.125
Inspector Sarkar?

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:20.790
I have good news.

00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:23.500
I found Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.541
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:27.332
It's purely coincidental.

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:30.750
One of my students is
his direct descendent.

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:32.791
The rest is easy.

00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:38.291
They can bring some proof
and take the dagger back.

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:41.375
Okay, yes. Thank you.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.290
Let me choose your outfit.

00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:01.457
Try a sea green jeans
and a pink top.

00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:02.208
It'll look good on you.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:03.833
Impossible!

00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:05.208
Follow me.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.250
Plassey... Plassey... Plassey...

00:25:44.708 --> 00:25:49.500
JAGAT SETH MEHTAB CHAND'S DECREE

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:03.332
Goddess Laxmi's beauty
and Goddess Saraswati's virtue.

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:05.082
It's nice but not festive...

00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:10.000
It's great! Now try these.

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:16.166
Some requests are meaningless, yet...

00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:28.333
Yes, Sona'da.

00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:31.791
Wait for me at your chamber.
I'll be there by 8 o'clock.

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:33.999
Call Jhinuk too.
Need to discuss something important.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.541
Festival planning.

00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:36.957
Why meet at my chamber
when we can go to China?

00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:37.625
Where?

00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:39.499
Mainland China, the restaurant.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.541
Jhinuk has been craving
Chinese food.

00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:43.416
She hardly ever asks for anything.

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:45.025
You didn't go to work today either?

00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.291
No, I'm at chamber only.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:48.750
Aabir...

00:26:49.791 --> 00:26:52.958
No, actually, couldn't escape
the mundane festival shopping.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.958
Okay, I get it.

00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:57.915
Mainland China, then.

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.291
Sharp at 8 p.m. Done.

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:10.708
He's deciding on the menu.

00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:12.540
- Sona'da!
- There you are.

00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:15.040
- So, done with shopping?
- Yes.

00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:18.208
- Yeah, it was Jhinuk's idea.
- What?

00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:20.708
I understand, Nephew.
Now, sit.

00:27:21.208 --> 00:27:22.832
- Let's start with a soup?
- Yes.

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.291
Excuse me!

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:27.207
The reason I asked you to come here...

00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:28.333
Thank you.

00:27:29.208 --> 00:27:31.332
Mehtab Chand and Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:32.624
I have information on both.

00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:33.915
- Really?
- Thank you.

00:27:33.916 --> 00:27:36.165
The person whom we know in history
as Jagat Seth

00:27:36.166 --> 00:27:37.916
his real name is Mehtab Chand.

00:27:38.083 --> 00:27:40.165
And Jagat Seth is not a name,
it's a title.

00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:41.540
Jagat Seth?

00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:44.874
The one who betrayed Siraj ud-Daulah.

00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:46.040
Correct.

00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:48.958
The richest banker
of 18th century Bengal.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:52.249
Apparently, even the Delhi court
was funded by Jagat Seth.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.999
And it is believed

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.374
that he was richer than
all the banks in England put together.

00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:00.791
Are you serious, Sona'da?

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.333
That was just 250 years ago.

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:07.707
Bengal had the richest treasures.

00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:08.915
Unbelievable!

00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:10.791
And now, about the owner number two.

00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:12.666
- Durgagoti Deb Roy.
- Yes.

00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:17.541
He was the Zamindar of a place
called Bonpukuriya in Bengal.

00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:20.082
And a close friend
of King Krishna Chandra Roy of Nadia.

00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:22.749
So the dagger was passed on
from Jagat Seth

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.040
to Krishna Chandra Roy.

00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:27.208
Then he gifted it to his friend,
Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:31.041
That's where the dagger was stolen from.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.375
How did you know?

00:28:32.376 --> 00:28:35.333
One of my students is the youngest son
of the Deb Roy family.

00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:37.791
- Domburopani Deb Roy.
- What? What?

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:40.583
And we will be in Bonpukuriya
during the festival.

00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.708
What a name? Bonpukuriya.

00:28:43.875 --> 00:28:45.207
- I told you.
- What?

00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:47.457
How I can I wear these western outfits
during the festival?

00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:48.166
No, never.

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:50.625
I'll wear only sarees
during the festival.

00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:54.750
Two sarees a day.
So, ten sarees in total.

00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:58.625
Poor boy... Some water please!

00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:07.583
Bishtu!

00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.790
You've crafted a masterpiece.

00:29:13.791 --> 00:29:16.833
Let me send a photo to boss.
Hold it, Lyata.

00:29:17.333 --> 00:29:19.207
Wow!

00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:21.458
You're blessed as an artiste!

00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:23.791
Lyata...

00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:28.708
Inform Syata that we're ready
to meet Inspector Sarkar.

00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:30.791
Boss will be there too.

00:29:32.416 --> 00:29:34.249
- Syata?
- Yes, sir.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.665
- Any new information for me?
- Nothing new, sir.

00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:39.000
Sir, there's someone here to meet you.

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.374
This is Mr. Bonbihari Giri.

00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:42.415
Hello.

00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:46.165
Could you show him
that antique dagger you recovered?

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:47.875
He's just returned from abroad.

00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:51.250
The way I bring information to you,
sometimes I help him too.

00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:55.125
I tell you who is smuggling
and I tell him what is being smuggled.

00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:59.291
He's a very serious art collector.

00:30:00.375 --> 00:30:01.666
I can vouch for him.

00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:03.750
If you could show us...

00:30:04.083 --> 00:30:06.958
You have Syata's word, sir.
You can trust him.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.041
Okay. Bring him in.
Please come in.

00:30:38.333 --> 00:30:38.958
Hello.

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:40.707
You awake? Nephew...

00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:42.832
Inform Jhinuk.

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:45.499
Tomorrow, after your swimming session

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.749
we'll reveal a new mystery.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.083
What's in the dagger?

00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:53.666
Wow! What's in the dagger?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.041
Aabir Lal Roy Bahadur!

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.041
Do you recognise this?

00:30:59.041 --> 00:30:59.708
Wow!

00:30:59.708 --> 00:31:00.625
Thank you.

00:31:00.626 --> 00:31:01.915
Now, see the magic.

00:31:01.916 --> 00:31:03.958
This is when the lights were on.

00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:06.565
And now see the magic of candlelight
when the lights went off.

00:31:07.916 --> 00:31:10.082
- Wow, Sona'da!
- Looks like Urdu.

00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:12.499
There was no Urdu in the 18th century.
This is Arabic.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.583
- Am I right, Sona'da?
- Please learn from her.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.165
Read it now.

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:18.874
Hope you know it's Arabic
and not Bengali.

00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:20.249
Not as simple as A for apple.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.457
Sona'da, it's written in Bengali.

00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:24.707
The same style of calligraphy
that Abindranath Tagore used.

00:31:24.708 --> 00:31:26.332
You're correct.

00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:30.250
(gibberish)

00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:32.915
Now do we have to learn Arabic?

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:34.874
Do you know how to read Arabic?

00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:36.040
Of course, I do.

00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:38.540
Most languages are read from left to right.
For Arabic, it's right to left.

00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:40.290
Bravo, Abir!
Just amazing!

00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:42.375
So read it...
Right to left.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.083
"This immense wealth of the world
That cannot be counted"

00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:53.165
"In many rituals,
performances and festivities"

00:31:53.166 --> 00:31:55.999
"If you have the correct insight
The treasure of the world will be yours."

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.333
- Sona'da! Hidden treasure!
- Keep your voice low. Control. Sorry.

00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:05.332
"This immense wealth of the world
That cannot be counted"

00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:07.332
Sona'da, it says wealth.
Another treasure hunt?

00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:10.290
Yes but it doesn't mean wealth
of the world.

00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:12.851
'World' here points to the man, Jagat Seth, one
of world's richest businessmen of the time.

00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:19.875
He had so much wealth that one could build
a dam over Ganges with it.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:24.125
The British could never find the extent
of his wealth.

00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:26.833
The dagger is still
with Inspector Sarkar.

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:28.707
Can we see it again?

00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:30.375
Yes, please, Sona'da.

00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:32.833
Please come in.

00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.250
Extremely sorry to disturb you.

00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:36.833
No problem at all.

00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:38.874
Can we see that royal dagger again?

00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:40.124
Certainly!

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.374
But first, what will you eat?

00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:44.665
- Fish fry?
- No, no...

00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:47.457
Please don't order for any food.
We are very full, right, Jhinuk?

00:32:47.458 --> 00:32:49.291
Sure. Please sit.

00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:52.000
What's wrong?

00:32:55.875 --> 00:32:57.000
What happened?

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.541
Sit quietly.
What are you doing?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.540
- Sona'da?
- Quiet.

00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:03.249
- Semonti Sarkar.
- He can hear you.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.291
- Shimla.
- What?

00:33:05.208 --> 00:33:07.165
- That was taken in Shimla.
- Oh, okay.

00:33:07.166 --> 00:33:08.540
There it is.

00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:09.665
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:11.332
Can you switch off the lights?

00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:14.416
- Want to show you something special.
- Oh really?

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.041
- This is not the real dagger.
- What do you mean?

00:33:28.208 --> 00:33:30.582
An inscription glows in the dark
on the real dagger.

00:33:30.583 --> 00:33:32.541
They've seen that in the photograph.

00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:37.250
That means the real dagger
has been stolen?

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.083
There's only one problem, Mr. Sarkar.
No one will believe you.

00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:48.415
Your informer must have brought
the thief here.

00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:52.750
- Yes but believe me...
- I do, but that's not important.

00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:56.040
The dagger wasn't just an antique.
It's value...

00:33:56.041 --> 00:33:59.499
What should I do now?
I have no idea.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.040
Don't worry.

00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:04.041
We'll see what can be done.

00:34:05.708 --> 00:34:07.499
- One more thing.
- Yes?

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.208
Don't inform anyone just yet.

00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:19.790
Sona'da, Jhinuk, Aabir
The trio is back

00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:22.125
On a quest to find hidden treasure

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.291
"The endless path is charted out
For the two of us, the lovers of wind."

00:35:41.916 --> 00:35:43.499
Rabindranath Tagore's famous poem.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.999
Please drop me off here.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.665
Jhinuk just wants the two of you to go.

00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.416
Rubbish!

00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.250
The poem is over.
So am I.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.374
Hunger makes the world
seem prosaic.

00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:57.000
How far is Bonpukuriya?
I'm really hungry.

00:35:57.041 --> 00:35:58.708
Half an hour at this speed.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:35:59.666
How did you know?

00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:01.540
Speedometer says 60 KMs.

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:04.000
And milestone says 30 KMs away.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:22.625
- Welcome, sir!
- Thank you.

00:36:22.666 --> 00:36:23.500
My brother.

00:36:23.625 --> 00:36:25.957
Hello, I'm Dr. Pinakpani Deb Roy.

00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:26.625
Dumble's elder brother.

00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:30.625
Subarna Sen. Jhinuk.
And this is Aabir.

00:36:30.958 --> 00:36:32.290
Hope you didn't have any trouble
finding the place.

00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:34.332
- Not at all.
- I'm very hungry.

00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:35.749
This looks like a palace.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.916
You've maintained it really well.
Unbelievable!

00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:41.207
It's like maintaining an elephant, Subarna.

00:36:41.208 --> 00:36:45.040
Manohar, please put the gentlemen's bags
in the guest house.

00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:46.749
- The guesthouse is kept prepared for you.
- Okay.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.415
Lokhhi, please take madam's bags
to Aunt's room.

00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:52.165
- Hope that won't be a problem.
- Nope.

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:55.083
Aunt is great at conversations.
Time just flies with her.

00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:57.583
Let's go in.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.541
Come.

00:36:58.583 --> 00:36:59.625
Aunt's room.

00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:02.791
This way.

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:07.540
- Please come in.
- Of course.

00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:09.875
- Beautiful!
- This way.

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:19.750
Have you noticed the lion's face?

00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:21.165
Looks like horse.

00:37:21.166 --> 00:37:26.041
Tintin has Snowy, Chhota Bheem has Jagoo,
Goddess Durga has Simba.

00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:29.040
- What's your name?
- Adrish Deb Roy.

00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:31.749
- What is your name?
- Sona'da.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.707
That's Aabir and this is Jhinuk.

00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:35.707
Have you watched Spiderman?

00:37:35.708 --> 00:37:36.625
Peter Parker.

00:37:36.626 --> 00:37:40.749
Remember how many arms
Doctor Octopus had?

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.290
Goddess Durga has many arms too.

00:37:42.291 --> 00:37:46.415
But Doctor Octopus used his powers
for evil deeds.

00:37:46.416 --> 00:37:47.499
But what does Goddess Durga do?

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.499
- Defeated evil Mahishashur with a... Bang!
- Oh my God!

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.165
Then Goddess Durga is also an Avenger.

00:37:54.166 --> 00:37:55.458
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:37:55.833 --> 00:37:58.249
That's Kucho,
my second brother's son.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.457
They live in Atlanta.

00:37:59.458 --> 00:38:01.416
- They got here yesterday.
- He's very sweet.

00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:04.624
Pinakpani, don't mind me asking this.

00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:06.425
Are you Vaishnavas,
followers of Lord Krishna?

00:38:07.166 --> 00:38:09.915
No, we are Shaktas,
followers of the feminine energy.

00:38:09.916 --> 00:38:10.500
Why do you ask?

00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:12.790
Then the lion's face should have been
like a lion.

00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:15.833
But that's a Vaishnava lion.
It has the face of a horse.

00:38:16.083 --> 00:38:17.790
The story goes...

00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:20.790
The festival in this family was initiated
by Krishna Chandra Roy

00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:24.333
with his friend and our Old Grandpa,
Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:38:24.458 --> 00:38:29.333
That's why, just like the traditional Krishnanagar
idol, this lion also looks like a horse.

00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:31.208
Did you know?

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:34.790
Oh, no! What are you doing?

00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:37.500
Once Mother Goddess arrives home,
you shouldn't touch anyone's feet.

00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:40.499
Our Aunt brought us up.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.249
That's enough.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.583
You've travelled a long distance.
You must be hungry.

00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:48.082
Freshen up.

00:38:48.083 --> 00:38:50.457
Jhinuk, you'll be staying with me.

00:38:50.458 --> 00:38:53.750
Hope you don't mind.

00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:55.665
That's fine.

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:56.874
I'll feel at home.

00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:58.833
You're really sweet.

00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:01.082
- What is it?
- I'm very hungry, Aunt!

00:39:01.083 --> 00:39:05.165
Have your food
and come to the courtyard.

00:39:05.166 --> 00:39:06.999
We'll be putting the weapons
on the goddess.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.665
Then Damodar Kirtaniya will sing
our traditional song.

00:39:09.666 --> 00:39:15.333
- Kalu, have you brought the weapons?
- Yes, Aunt. It's all here.

00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:21.208
Have you seen the photograph?

00:39:21.708 --> 00:39:23.249
And the hairstyle?

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.666
U-cut.

00:39:24.875 --> 00:39:26.790
There are only two UKs for Bengalis.

00:39:26.791 --> 00:39:28.749
Before the Independence,
it was United Kingdom.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.375
And after, Uttam Kumar, the superstar.

00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:34.915
If we didn't come here, we'd have missed
the real flavour of the festival.

00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:37.541
We'll be eating bhog,
the offerings, all day.

00:39:39.291 --> 00:39:41.125
Are you ready, sir?

00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:43.165
Jhinuk is really funny.

00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:46.750
She said ask the foodie to get ready
quickly or the festival will be over.

00:39:47.041 --> 00:39:49.500
Foodie!

00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:51.790
- Let's go, Sona'da.
- Yeah.

00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:53.458
Let's go, sir.

00:39:54.833 --> 00:39:57.958
Jhinuk! Jhinuk!
This is not right.

00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:01.416
You called me a foodie?
That I don't...

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.291
Great!

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:12.000
Speechless?

00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:14.290
Was I wrong?

00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:16.125
Don't you take a long time
to get ready?

00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:17.416
Yes.

00:40:17.417 --> 00:40:21.749
- Aren't you a foodie?
- That gives me food for thought.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.832
See Sona'da, how he changed the topic?

00:40:23.833 --> 00:40:25.832
He's Mr. Lawyer, after all.

00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:27.958
This way, sir.

00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:40.333
Sir, enjoy your meal.
I'll be right back.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.708
Go ahead.

00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:44.000
Fried bread, semolina porridge...

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.582
And you must try the sweets.
It's all homemade.

00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:50.333
Moni, this is Sona'da and Aabir.

00:40:50.458 --> 00:40:53.999
Moni is Pinku's wife
and Rini is Kucho's mom.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.375
You two look perfect together.

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:01.499
Everything is cooked in low cholestrol oil.
You can eat without worrying.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.957
I don't think that's a concern for him.

00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:04.916
Eat up.

00:41:04.917 --> 00:41:08.750
If it's eaten hot
it has no ill effects.

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.249
Then please start eating.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.832
- You must finish it all.
- Of course.

00:41:12.833 --> 00:41:14.625
- Jhinuk, come with us.
- Yes.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.333
- Nephew...
- Strong data base.

00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:24.500
Moni and Rini.

00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:26.749
Pinakpani is now Pinku.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.707
She's even wearing matching clothes
with Kucho.

00:41:29.708 --> 00:41:31.332
Isn't it great?

00:41:31.333 --> 00:41:34.041
I was thinking if Dumble...

00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:39.958
Fluffy fried breads taste great.

00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:43.208
- And these soggy ones are great too.
- Correct.

00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:46.500
Soggy fried breads are not called 'luchi'
in Bengali.

00:41:46.666 --> 00:41:48.000
It's called 'nuchi'.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:56.082
Pinku, when will you rectify
your childhood mistakes?

00:41:56.083 --> 00:41:56.833
What mistakes?

00:41:56.834 --> 00:41:59.082
The conch will be in the top left hand.

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.250
And the disc in the top right hand.

00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:05.874
As much as you may scold me,
Shuli never bothered to learn at all.

00:42:05.875 --> 00:42:07.374
Oh, wow!

00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:10.833
Uncle, as a child
you made mistakes too?

00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:15.624
Kucho, you've been spared
from Aunt's wrath.

00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:18.124
I still can't get over it.

00:42:18.125 --> 00:42:21.374
Grand Aunty, did you have a temper?

00:42:21.375 --> 00:42:22.833
Is that what you think?

00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:24.416
Not at all.

00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:31.291
Oh Mother!

00:42:35.708 --> 00:42:39.833
Take the plunge with Goddess Durga's name
on your lips

00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:42.750
Sit, sit, sit.

00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:48.875
- I can't...
- Don't say no.

00:42:48.916 --> 00:42:51.540
You should accept the
gifts from your elders.

00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:53.374
Wear it. You'll look very pretty.

00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:54.541
Go on.

00:42:56.166 --> 00:42:57.500
There you go.

00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:59.291
Let's see.

00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:01.624
Wow! So beautiful!

00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:09.625
Will the lake of the heart be empty
if there's no treasure in its depth?

00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:22.375
Even your tears will gleam
like precious stones

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:33.250
Will the lake of the heart be empty?

00:43:35.708 --> 00:43:43.708
Krishna yearns to return home

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Uma shares his grief
For her festival may remain unattended

00:43:56.875 --> 00:44:04.875
Krishna brings Uma back as Jagadhatri

00:44:05.208 --> 00:44:13.208
Forgive us for not inviting you
in Spring, oh Goddess

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:21.625
In an untimely celebration
Durga celebrates Durga

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:30.250
Will the lake of the heart be empty?

00:44:39.416 --> 00:44:40.333
- Aunt.
- Yes?

00:44:40.334 --> 00:44:42.582
This song was written by
Durgagoti Deb Roy, isn't it?

00:44:42.583 --> 00:44:46.625
Yes. Old Grandpa was very talented.

00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:49.832
He used to write songs, compose music...

00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:51.666
He was a prolific painter too.

00:44:51.791 --> 00:44:54.750
He went to art school in England.

00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:55.999
England.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.916
How did you know
that he had written the song?

00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:02.290
Back in those days, the writer would always
mention his name at the end of the song.

00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:04.041
- "Bhonita"!
- Correct.

00:45:04.708 --> 00:45:05.708
Didn't you hear the song?

00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:09.290
"Forgive us for not inviting you
in Spring, oh Goddess."

00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:13.415
"In an untimely celebration
Durga celebrates Durga."

00:45:13.416 --> 00:45:16.790
Which means Durgagoti is celebrating
the Durga festival.

00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:18.458
- Am I right, Aunt?
- Absolutely!

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:24.333
Back then, many people were affected
by chicken pox in Spring.

00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:27.166
That's why they shifted the time
of the festival.

00:45:27.333 --> 00:45:29.625
And started celebrations in Autumn.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.416
It's better not to celebrate
in the time of disease.

00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.291
That's so wonderful!

00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:44.500
Did you get the hidden story
in the song?

00:45:45.458 --> 00:45:46.832
Oh right, you two were busy...

00:45:46.833 --> 00:45:48.207
Sona'da, please...

00:45:48.208 --> 00:45:49.166
What happened was...

00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:52.458
Krishna Chandra was imprisoned
under the pretense of defaulting taxes.

00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:54.290
The very Durga festival he started

00:45:54.291 --> 00:45:56.624
he couldn't celebrate
because he was in prison.

00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:58.250
And that made him really sad.

00:45:58.458 --> 00:46:02.499
"Krishna yearns to return home...

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:06.916
Uma shares his grief
For her festival may remain unattended."

00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:11.125
When he was finally released,
the time for the Durga festival had past.

00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:15.500
That's why he started the Jagadhatri
festival in Krishnanagar on a large scale.

00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:19.457
We're familiar with the Jagadhatri festival
in Chandannagore.

00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:23.291
It's very popular in Krishnanagar too.

00:46:23.958 --> 00:46:28.666
"Krishna brings Uma back as Jagadhatri."

00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:30.916
Mehtab Chand Jagat Seth...

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.499
Maharaja Krishna Chandra...

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.250
Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:46:34.416 --> 00:46:37.208
They are all connected with...

00:46:37.458 --> 00:46:39.166
that dagger!

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.958
"The treasure of the world will be yours."

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:43.625
Where?

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.583
In Bonpukuriya?

00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:47.250
Good evening.

00:46:48.958 --> 00:46:50.082
What's the matter?

00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:53.833
So, what brings History Professor Subarna
Sen to this obscure village, Bonpukuriya?

00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:59.416
You must be following the rubbish rumour
about Raja Krishna Chandra's treasure.

00:47:00.666 --> 00:47:01.875
Great.

00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:03.375
Keep looking.

00:47:03.833 --> 00:47:05.273
It'll be great if you could find it.

00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:07.415
All the best!

00:47:07.416 --> 00:47:09.541
I'm Trishulpani Deb Roy.

00:47:09.666 --> 00:47:11.750
I'm the second son of
this illustrious family.

00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:14.458
So silly!

00:47:18.166 --> 00:47:19.708
Thank you.

00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:24.125
Please begin.

00:47:24.458 --> 00:47:26.750
These are all traditional recipes
of our family.

00:47:26.833 --> 00:47:30.375
Saffron rice, aubergine in yogurt
and sweet dumplings in milk.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.041
I'm not letting you off
till you finish it all.

00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:36.415
Make sure they finish.

00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:37.915
Eat up.

00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:40.041
- Let's go.
- Don't feel shy.

00:47:40.833 --> 00:47:42.457
You live in Atlanta, right?

00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:46.666
- Kucho, finish your dinner!
- I'm not hungry.

00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:48.000
And you came back from UK?

00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:51.458
Strange.

00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:55.375
We had a popular song as kids.

00:47:55.458 --> 00:47:59.541
"India is synonymous to the Sun".

00:47:59.666 --> 00:48:01.866
But now the country is synonymous
to four other factors.

00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:05.250
Pollution, corruption,
reccession and manipulation.

00:48:05.583 --> 00:48:08.625
Are you saying
these don't exist in the US?

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.540
Why won't it? But at this level,
I don't think so.

00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:14.041
I see it differently though.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.583
Tradition, devotion...

00:48:16.916 --> 00:48:20.750
Imagination and great unification!

00:48:21.208 --> 00:48:23.625
Your ancestor, Durgagoti Deb Roy.

00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.500
He had been to England too.

00:48:25.583 --> 00:48:28.249
But he came back to India
after his education.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.875
He returned to his roots.

00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.500
And how did it benefit him?

00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:35.666
He was Raja Krishna Chandra's best friend.

00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:38.207
So? Does history remember him?

00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:40.916
See if you find his rumoured
hidden treasure in this house.

00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:47.250
We've invited sir here.

00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:49.416
Yeah... oh...

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.458
Basically, they are using you.

00:48:53.166 --> 00:48:55.208
Good, great plan!

00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:59.374
Wish you success.
Don't forget my share, brother.

00:48:59.375 --> 00:49:02.374
- Don't steal it.
- Shuli! What are you saying?

00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:03.499
I prefer being direct.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.500
I call a spade a spade.

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:07.166
Don't discuss things
you don't understand.

00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:08.958
That's what I do, don't I?

00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:12.416
You're celebrating
the great Durgagoti's Durga festival.

00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:13.767
You're feeding numerous people.

00:49:13.791 --> 00:49:15.624
You're paying for the employee's
families... Organising musical soirees...

00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:16.541
Pointless investments.

00:49:16.542 --> 00:49:19.124
Contributing to the festival
is an investment for you?

00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:21.958
Not only investment, brother.
Zero return investment.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.790
Are you doing it on your own?

00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:26.541
Then why are you involving me?

00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:29.000
Please go ahead without me...

00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:31.625
If you can manage this huge event
without me, please do it.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Count me out next year onwards.

00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:36.583
Hey, Shuli!

00:49:37.375 --> 00:49:40.083
- Please eat...
- Sorry, sir.

00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:42.583
- It's okay.
- Please don't mind, Subarna.

00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:47.041
There's some trouble in Shuli's office
back in the States.

00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:50.041
- He's really under pressure.
- No, it's fine.

00:49:50.333 --> 00:49:52.500
He's really not like this.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:56.000
Don't try to cover up for him.

00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:58.458
He wasn't like this
when he was here.

00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:01.208
He has forgotten his roots
since he moved abroad.

00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:03.583
Shuli is probably right.

00:50:03.708 --> 00:50:05.628
The rituals and traditions
of the Deb Roy family.

00:50:05.666 --> 00:50:07.790
These haven't changed.

00:50:07.791 --> 00:50:10.249
It takes a lot of effort
to abide by them.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.165
Are you talking about anything
in particular?

00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.166
Quite a few things, sir.

00:50:13.167 --> 00:50:15.125
The craftsmen who make the idols...

00:50:15.208 --> 00:50:16.000
The artistes who paint the backdrop...

00:50:16.041 --> 00:50:18.124
The drummers, the cooks, the singers...

00:50:18.125 --> 00:50:20.540
They've been working with our family
for generations.

00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:22.040
And according to Durgagoti's will

00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:23.999
each of them are still paid expenses
every month.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:24.958
So you can understand.

00:50:24.959 --> 00:50:26.458
That's quite something.

00:50:27.375 --> 00:50:31.291
For you, a family means a husband,
a wife and a child.

00:50:31.416 --> 00:50:33.500
For us it was the entire extended family.

00:50:33.625 --> 00:50:41.208
And for Durgagoti, his subjects
and employees were also his family.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:42.750
Nowadays, it's just each to his own.

00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:44.458
Try these sweet dumplings.

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:46.541
You won't find it in Kolkata.

00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:55.291
Pickles?

00:50:55.416 --> 00:50:57.625
- Aunt?
- Do you want some?

00:50:57.833 --> 00:50:59.458
Please go ahead.

00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:01.541
Pickled berries!

00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:14.000
What are you doing
with the clove, Aunt?

00:51:14.791 --> 00:51:19.625
Once I prepare the beetleleaf...

00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:27.916
I'll use the clove
to hold it all together.

00:51:28.541 --> 00:51:31.559
We're doing the bathing ritual for 'Kola
Bou', the Banana Tree Bride at dawn.

00:51:31.583 --> 00:51:34.665
- Are you coming?
- Of course.

00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:38.582
- Will Aabir join us?
- That sleepy head?

00:51:38.583 --> 00:51:40.458
Let me find out.

00:51:44.458 --> 00:51:45.250
Hi, Jhinuk. Tell me.

00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:46.041
Sona'da?

00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:46.791
Yes?

00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:48.142
Will you join us for the rituals
in the morning?

00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:48.916
Certainly.

00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:50.750
And Mr. Sleeping Beauty?

00:51:50.958 --> 00:51:51.958
Will he join us?

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.416
He's posed like the reclining Krishna
right now.

00:51:54.666 --> 00:51:56.166
I'll try.

00:51:56.375 --> 00:51:58.541
Aabir...

00:51:59.375 --> 00:52:01.935
Will you go for the Banana Tree
Bride's rituals tomorrow morning?

00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.750
Whose bride?

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.874
Lord Ganesha's bride.

00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:09.166
Are you coming in the morning?

00:52:11.458 --> 00:52:13.916
I'm not interested
in other people's brides.

00:52:15.208 --> 00:52:17.958
Do you even know the ritual?

00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:20.375
Do you?

00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:26.708
Don't worry. I'll bring him
with me tomorrow.

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:28.041
When are we leaving?

00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:29.249
One minute.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.500
When are we leaving?

00:52:31.458 --> 00:52:33.458
Dil Dighi is quite far.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.000
Say around 5 a.m.

00:52:36.541 --> 00:52:38.500
Okay. Around 5 a.m.

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:39.916
Done. Good night.

00:52:40.291 --> 00:52:41.583
Good night.

00:53:03.416 --> 00:53:06.374
Kans grass have bloomed along the path

00:53:06.375 --> 00:53:09.332
Clouds adorn the blue skies

00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:14.874
White clouds glide like waves in the sky

00:53:14.875 --> 00:53:18.374
The river dances past

00:53:18.375 --> 00:53:21.249
Flowers of Autumn bloom

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:26.083
A bride is going to take a dip
in 'Dil Dighi' lake

00:53:29.875 --> 00:53:35.874
In a bid to appease Lord Ganesha

00:53:35.875 --> 00:53:43.875
And to seek his blessings,
the family prays to him

00:54:02.875 --> 00:54:05.832
Dressed up as a bride

00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:08.874
'Kola Bou' is given a bath

00:54:08.875 --> 00:54:14.750
Lord Ganesha's wife is placed beside him

00:54:15.375 --> 00:54:18.082
Kans grass have bloomed along the path

00:54:18.083 --> 00:54:20.833
Clouds adorn the blue skies

00:54:29.458 --> 00:54:30.708
Sir?

00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:32.291
Right here.

00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:33.541
Any news?

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.833
Well, sir...

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.416
Can I tag along with you
to abroad this time?

00:54:39.458 --> 00:54:40.541
We'll see.

00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:42.958
Let me take care of things here first.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.583
Keep an eye on Subarna Sen
and company.

00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:50.166
The nose ring on Goddess Durga
has a real diamond.

00:54:50.208 --> 00:54:51.374
So what?

00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:55.000
Diamond... Nose ring...

00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:57.458
Hey, that's holy...

00:54:58.666 --> 00:55:00.875
Don't mention it ever again.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.875
Subarna Sen must have sniffed
something out.

00:55:06.958 --> 00:55:08.833
But before he can find out...

00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:13.041
Hidden treasure?

00:55:14.708 --> 00:55:16.290
They are coming this way...
Leave.

00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:17.333
What?

00:55:17.416 --> 00:55:18.916
Leave...

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:27.250
Lord Ganesha's wife is placed beside him

00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:34.499
What are you doing here so early?

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.250
Went for a jog.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.750
You guys carry on.
I'll be at home.

00:55:39.791 --> 00:55:41.625
Let him be.
Let's go.

00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:07.333
Hey, Damodar!
Time to start the real song!

00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:23.832
To get the blessings
from the one who faces South

00:56:23.833 --> 00:56:29.207
Walk along the wall on the East

00:56:29.208 --> 00:56:35.040
Look where the Sun sets

00:56:35.041 --> 00:56:41.374
Don't meander away

00:56:41.375 --> 00:56:49.375
Durga, the destroyer of obstacles
Durga, the Goddess of the Universe

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.332
Rise Mother Goddess!

00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:59.458
Durga, the destroyer of obstacles

00:57:04.458 --> 00:57:05.708
Hey, Dumble.

00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:09.040
Why did we come this far
when there's a river next to the house?

00:57:09.041 --> 00:57:11.249
Another one of Old Grandpa's instructions.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.500
The ritual must take place here.

00:57:19.458 --> 00:57:22.290
Halfway there you'll find the steps

00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:25.208
Descend to the water's edge

00:57:25.458 --> 00:57:28.290
The depth calls out to take a plunge

00:57:28.291 --> 00:57:36.291
Have faith in the Goddess
and take a dip

00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:43.374
The depth calls out to take a plunge

00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:46.291
Have faith in the Goddess
and take a dip

00:57:46.416 --> 00:57:54.416
Swim to Kailash The heart of the
lake hides the stone you seek

00:57:55.291 --> 00:58:00.916
Durgagoti says don't indulge
in your desires

00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:03.416
Is this just a song?

00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:04.875
What?

00:58:04.876 --> 00:58:06.750
Which direction is East?

00:58:07.625 --> 00:58:10.458
East? Sun rises in the East.

00:58:10.875 --> 00:58:13.124
But if that is East

00:58:13.125 --> 00:58:15.874
then the song doesn't make sense.

00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:17.750
Sun and song are not going along?

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.708
If the Sun's zone
doesn't match the song's tone

00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:24.500
Jagat's wealth can't be found.

00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:31.583
(chanting)

00:58:35.458 --> 00:58:37.415
Should we get more sweets?

00:58:37.416 --> 00:58:39.332
Have you seen 'Kola bou's coyness?

00:58:39.333 --> 00:58:41.125
Have you seen Ganesha's tummy?

00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:46.874
Now let's memorise the song.

00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:49.040
"To get the blessings from the one
who faces South."

00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:51.208
"Walk along the wall on the East."

00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:56.499
Aunt, this song is very interesting too.

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.665
Yes, this was also written
by Old Grandpa.

00:58:59.666 --> 00:59:02.999
Yes, it's there in the song's last line.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.750
"Durgagoti says don't indulge
in your desires".

00:59:06.958 --> 00:59:08.124
Now sing it.

00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:10.375
"To get the blessings from the one
who faces South".

00:59:10.458 --> 00:59:12.749
"Walk along the wall on the East."

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.250
"Look where the Sun sets."

00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:17.000
What's all this?

00:59:17.791 --> 00:59:19.309
Why are you teaching him
these silly songs?

00:59:19.333 --> 00:59:20.500
Shuli!

00:59:20.625 --> 00:59:23.207
This is our traditional song.
Everyone should learn it.

00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:24.874
You've learnt it too.

00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:27.332
Won't I teach it to the youngest member
of the family?

00:59:27.333 --> 00:59:29.666
I learnt it as a kid.
So what?

00:59:29.833 --> 00:59:31.582
Worthless rituals
and meaningless songs.

00:59:31.583 --> 00:59:34.833
Papa, I love the song.

00:59:35.375 --> 00:59:37.083
Meaningless?

00:59:37.166 --> 00:59:39.083
Didn't you record the song?

00:59:39.875 --> 00:59:41.583
Come here.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.916
Stop talking and come here.

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.124
Do you remember
what your mother used to say?

00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:50.874
Nothing in life is meaningless!

00:59:50.875 --> 00:59:52.791
Every mother says that, Aunt.

00:59:52.833 --> 00:59:56.125
Actually, it was Rabindranath Tagore
who wrote it.

00:59:57.541 --> 01:00:00.790
- Apu!
- Dumble!

01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:01.957
How are you?

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:02.833
What's up, Shuli?

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:04.708
- You're here too.
- Yeah.

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:07.707
Wonderful! Let's go.

01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:08.915
How are you, Aunt?

01:00:08.916 --> 01:00:11.458
Finally you remember your aunt?

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:15.916
- How have you been?
- Fantastic! Fabulous! Amazing!

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:18.915
Now the family seems complete.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.166
Do you know them?

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.624
Subarna Sen.

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:22.875
This is him.

01:00:22.916 --> 01:00:25.291
Subarna Sen! Oh wow!

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.165
Oxford! Shah Shuja's hidden treasure!

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:30.249
My God! What good fortune!

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:31.874
- Hello.
- Let me introduce you.

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.957
Apu aka Aparup Chandra.

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:36.249
Famous jewellers, Chandra and Sons...

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:37.041
He belongs to that family.

01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:39.708
- He's a real jewel!
- Not at all.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.151
I'm the black sheep of the family.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.541
Since I hated the family business
my father turned melodramatic.

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:50.791
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself?", he said.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.040
He almost disowned me.

01:00:53.041 --> 01:00:55.290
It was my mother's tears that...

01:00:55.291 --> 01:00:58.040
And you spent your entire life
in academics.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.249
Bonpukuriya is my home.

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:03.750
And that's why I never miss
this family's Durga festival!

01:01:03.916 --> 01:01:05.374
He's a true entertainer!

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.957
Aunt considers him as
the eldest son of our family.

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:12.833
Leave all that. I'm hungry.

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:16.750
First tell me what's there for breakfast?

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:20.750
Fried bread, potato curry,
brinjal fritters and sweets.

01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:24.207
- I'm Aabir.
- Extraordinary!

01:01:24.208 --> 01:01:28.791
All great men think alike...
Especially foodies!

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:29.625
It's going to be great fun!

01:01:29.626 --> 01:01:33.249
Food for thought with you
and food to savour with him.

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.250
Badaboom!

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:58.916
(chanting)

01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:00.665
Give me your phone.

01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:08.666
(chanting)

01:02:37.791 --> 01:02:40.124
Hope there's mutton for lunch.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.207
Today there's only vegetarian food.

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:43.165
Delicious jackfruit curry today.

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:45.582
Just try it, Aabir.

01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:47.915
The true Bengali delicacies
are the vegetarian dishes.

01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:50.166
But you won't know it
unless you dig in.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:56.250
They have 'tasteless boil'.
We have 'tasteful oil'.

01:02:56.958 --> 01:02:59.719
The entire community is on a downward
spiral for this food fanaticism.

01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:00.875
Bengalis don't just eat food.

01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:07.040
They are true connoisseurs.

01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:08.121
In every sense of the word.

01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:14.958
Badaboom!

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:37.415
The jackfruit curry was truly delicious.

01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:41.500
Didn't I tell you a little
extra oil makes it tastier.

01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:44.750
Did Durgagoti build this house?

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:47.375
Yes, certainly.
Not an easy task.

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:54.040
Krishna Chandra visited with
Gopal Bhar and poet Bharat Chandra.

01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:55.332
And started the Durga festival here.

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:56.333
- Okay...
- Really...

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:59.708
Difficult to believe that Gopal Bhar
and Siraj ud-Daulah were contemporaries.

01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:02.041
There are many examples like this.

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:05.332
Do you know that poet Nazrul Islam
was younger than poet Jibananda Das?

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:06.333
- What?
- Or...

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:09.416
Vidyasagar and Queen of Jhansi
were contemporaries.

01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:13.499
You know Jhinuk,
we call this mental mapping.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.166
The entire map is etched in our head.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.833
Krishna Chandra came to this house?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.625
Not here exactly.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:24.625
Professor, have you heard
of Durgeshgarh?

01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:25.957
Where is that?

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:27.208
Is it in Rajasthan or Gwalior?

01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:28.531
That's the problem right there.

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.500
That's mental mapping again.

01:04:30.708 --> 01:04:34.666
The name suggests
central or western India.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.541
But Durgeshgarh is right here.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.708
It's the other side of Bonpukuriya.

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:41.166
Say Murshid Quli Khan...

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:44.290
He renamed Maksoodabad
to Murshidabad after himself.

01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:46.082
Like Siraj ud-Daulah

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.999
after Alivardi Khan

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.707
renamed Kolkata to Alinagar.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:51.999
In the same manner, Durgagoti

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.082
constructed a huge palace here

01:04:55.083 --> 01:04:57.083
and named it Durgeshgarh
after himself.

01:04:57.916 --> 01:05:01.249
But no one in the family mentions the name
during the festival.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.916
- Why?
- The matter...

01:05:01.917 --> 01:05:05.416
Once there was a huge earthquake
during the festival.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:08.707
The palace was destroyed.

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:11.999
Old Grandpa and his family
somehow escaped.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.207
Thereafter, Durgagoti built this palace.

01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:15.833
I see.

01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:17.999
Can we visit Durgeshgarh?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.583
Why not?

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.083
But there are some rules
in this house.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.249
We can visit once the festival is over.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.499
Where is the exact location
of this place?

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.874
- Where 'Kola Bou' was bathed.
- Dil Dighi lake?

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:31.041
It's on the other side of the lake.

01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:33.790
- Did you notice a old wall?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:36.375
That was the boundary
of Durgeshgarh.

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:39.832
Correct! The Sun is finally
matching the song.

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:42.332
- Can we go there?
- Apu can take you.

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:45.000
He is the walking encyclopedia.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.999
So, should we include him
in our team?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.583
Is there any confusion?
I'm already in.

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.958
Let's go.

01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:05.957
"To get the blessings from the one
who faces South".

01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:10.582
The Durga idol of the Deb Roy mansion
always faces South.

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:10.875
Right.

01:06:10.876 --> 01:06:13.708
To get Durga's blessing one must
"walk along the wall on the East".

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.166
That means we have to follow
the wall on the East.

01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:18.124
"Look where the Sun sets".

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:21.124
That means we have to look
to the West.

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:22.665
"Don't meander away."

01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:24.083
Go straight. Come, come.

01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:26.208
This is so exciting!

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:27.707
The dagger holds clues.

01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:30.165
Even Damodar Kirtaniya's song
is a riddle.

01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:32.374
- We've been such fools.
- We always knew the song.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.541
- But never understood it's true meaning.
- Come on.

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:37.832
"Halfway there, you'll find the steps".

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:38.875
These are the steps.

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:40.540
"The depth calls out to take a plunge".

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:43.166
"Have faith in the Goddess
and take a dip".

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:46.707
Which means we have to dive underwater.

01:06:46.708 --> 01:06:48.874
"Swim to Kailash".

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.040
- Kailash?
- Yes, to the North.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.790
You have to swim towards North
under the water.

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:57.708
- So, "lake of hearts" is Dil Dighi lake?
- Correct.

01:06:57.916 --> 01:07:00.082
- Sona'da, should I dive in?
- No, control.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:02.249
Not now. We'll come back in the evening.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.708
When the rest of the people will be busy
with festivities...

01:07:04.791 --> 01:07:07.708
Sona'da, what's the connection
between the Sun and the song?

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:08.791
Very simple.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:12.040
This wall faces West of Bonpukuriya

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:14.500
but from Durgeshgarh it faces East.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:18.207
Durgagoti wrote this song
when he was in Durgeshgarh.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.916
The entire map has flipped, Jhinuk.

01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:24.582
Nephew, the Sun and the song
are in the same zone now.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:25.583
So...

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.040
Sona'da, I'm ready.

01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:32.767
- I can see that.
- I'll dive into the water.

01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:34.332
- Why do you want to risk it in the dark?
- Please, please, please...

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:35.559
- I'm there.
- Please let me do it.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.750
Let Jhinuk see that I don't just
earn calories but burn them too.

01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:40.249
- Subarna!
- Relax.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.790
I hear you've made a discovery!

01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:45.165
- We're very excited!
- Thank you.

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:47.249
Off to another expedition?

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.291
Not him. I am.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.083
- All the best.
- Thank you.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:53.125
Dumble, let's get going.

01:07:53.126 --> 01:07:55.249
- Dumble, take care of them.
- Of course.

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.124
- Let's go.
- Jhinuk is here too.

01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:59.707
Are you ready Micheal Phelps?

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.666
Michael Phelps?

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:03.416
Let's go.

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:05.333
- All the best!
- Thank you, sir.

01:08:18.708 --> 01:08:19.708
Hello.

01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:26.749
Let's meet by the river
On this moonlit night...

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:29.041
Here you are.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:34.207
Autumns in the Bengal country side
can be quite chilly.

01:08:34.208 --> 01:08:35.541
Please be careful.

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:38.582
Drink this decoction up.

01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:40.125
- The same old mixture...
- Drink up.

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:46.250
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:50.125
It's too bitter.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:56.124
Apu has the same concoction for everthing
starting from headache to heartache.

01:08:56.125 --> 01:08:58.625
Dumble, talk to me.
I'm the one diving in.

01:08:58.833 --> 01:09:01.083
And don't talk about something
you don't understand.

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:05.332
Herbs are the answer to all ailments.

01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:06.999
Sir, should I go in too?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.749
- No, no...
- No point crowding the place.

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:13.832
- No need. You'll ruin your curls.
- What is this?

01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:15.000
Aabir, listen.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.249
According to Durgagoti's hints...

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.874
You have to swim North
which is this way.

01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:22.208
You'll find a stone there.

01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:24.500
I'm here if there's any trouble.

01:09:26.958 --> 01:09:29.583
Listen, are you sure?

01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:33.166
Sure.

01:09:34.083 --> 01:09:35.208
Aabir!

01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:45.208
Keep this and be careful.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.583
Don't worry.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.666
All the best.
Be careful.

01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:08.332
- Kailash is that way
- Yes, that way.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.625
All the best!

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:42.625
- Sona'da?
- Aabir!

01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:44.333
- Aabir!
- Aabir!

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:58.416
Aabir!

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:01.875
There he is!

01:12:01.876 --> 01:12:03.041
- Aabir!
- Aabir!

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:05.458
- Come out.
- Watch your step.

01:12:05.459 --> 01:12:07.207
- Hold his hand.
- Give me your hand.

01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:09.291
- What happened?
- A golden conch.

01:12:09.416 --> 01:12:10.083
Let me see.

01:12:10.084 --> 01:12:11.499
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.791
- Sona'da, golden conch.
- Very good. Very good.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.290
Somebody attacked me underwater.

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:21.250
- Which is why I warned you not to go.
- I gave it right back to him.

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:25.082
First, you need to dry up.

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:27.290
Sona'da, the stone underwater...

01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:29.040
I'll listen to you later.
Let's first get out of here.

01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:30.124
Let's go.

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:32.958
You can talk later.
My house is close by. Let's go there.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.374
Dumble, go home.

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:36.040
Tell them, they're at my place.

01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:39.374
Let's chat over some coffee.

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:42.708
- Let's go...
- Good thing I got extra clothes.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.291
Hurry up.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:03.500
(singing)

01:13:03.791 --> 01:13:06.000
- Change your clothes.
- Okay.

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:07.583
Please come.

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:20.332
He's like a talisman in my family.

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:22.915
His grandfather
was my grandfather's coachman.

01:13:22.916 --> 01:13:24.915
And now Nakul is my driver.

01:13:24.916 --> 01:13:27.708
He's getting fatter by the way.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:33.125
- Nakul, keep practising.
- Sir.

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:37.791
Not sure it'll help
but you might lose some weight.

01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:40.124
Please come in.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:42.666
Bolai, bring some coffee.

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:48.666
Got some very good coffee from Brazil
this time.

01:13:50.541 --> 01:13:52.166
What is it?

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:57.666
Okay, I'll look into it.

01:13:58.041 --> 01:14:01.749
What's happening, brother?
What are your guests up to?

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:03.499
Are they here trying to find
our hidden treasures?

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.040
- Brother?
- You're back.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.791
Where were you?

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:10.624
I was with sir and Apu.

01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:12.957
Everyone is at Apu's place now.

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:16.708
- We had just gone out.
- Are you satisfied?

01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:18.958
Apu and Subarna Sen.

01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:21.708
Great that they have found each other.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:26.416
- Shuli!
- Apu is going to lose his brain too.

01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:34.500
Tell him your secrets.
I'm leaving.

01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:38.208
What happened there?

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.330
- Lots happened. Let's go to Aunt's room.
- Let's go.

01:14:41.166 --> 01:14:43.582
I shouldn't have let you dive alone.

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.125
No, it's okay.

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:48.916
But how did the information
about our expedition leak?

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:51.791
- Sona'da...
- So, what did you see underwater?

01:14:51.916 --> 01:14:54.207
"Ensure that Goddess Durga's family
is kept together

01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:56.791
"Keeping her in centre and her kids
on either side

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:59.207
"If you've seen the Goddess' backdrop
Check the painting in it too

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.708
"How it all comes together
To become one whole".

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:05.666
See Sona'da, Mr. Lawyer's TMT factor.

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:07.250
TMT?

01:15:07.708 --> 01:15:09.624
Total Mugging-up Theory.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.000
But very well done.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:17.083
This poem of Old Grandpa is fantastic.

01:15:17.833 --> 01:15:20.958
"How it all comes together
To become one whole".

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.916
The entire family is bound against
a singular backdrop.

01:15:23.958 --> 01:15:26.624
Durga in the centre
holding the family together.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:28.165
She has Lord Shiva watching over her.

01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:30.291
He is the typical reluctant husband.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.541
Her kids are by her side.

01:15:32.583 --> 01:15:35.125
One son is a sportsman
and the other one is a foodie.

01:15:35.166 --> 01:15:37.124
One daughter keeps count
and the other one studies.

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:38.915
Not just human figures.

01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:44.833
Lion, bull, owl, rat, swan, peacock,
and even a banana plant.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.790
All living elements have been included
within a singular backdrop.

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:51.165
And look at the food chain also.

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:52.666
Peacocks and snakes,
hunter and prey.

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:54.166
Lion and bull, hunter and prey.

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:55.500
Owl and rat, hunter and prey.

01:15:55.583 --> 01:16:00.125
Three sets of hunters and preys
yet there's beautiful harmony.

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.976
There's the eternal fight between good
and evil. There's women empowerment.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.958
But still good means white
and black means bad.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This is not good.

01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:11.832
Jhinuk, whether it's a British colony
or an Aryan settlement...

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.791
the disparity between
black and white remains.

01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:17.166
"How it all comes together
To become one whole".

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.625
You know what I think, Professor?

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:22.915
Goddess Durga's entire family
was bound within a single backdrop.

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:26.708
Now in modern depiction, it's split
into individual backdrops for each.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:31.707
Just like our joint families
are breaking into nuclear families.

01:16:31.708 --> 01:16:35.750
Goddess Durga's family is breaking up too.

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:39.582
The "one whole" is falling apart.

01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:44.500
When our society is falling apart how will
Goddess Durga's family stay together?

01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:47.915
Anyway, thank you for the coffee.

01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:50.166
- We'll take your leave.
- Yes, better get going.

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:52.957
I'm sure they are quite tensed.

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:56.000
Jhinuk, that conch is the hidden treasure.

01:16:56.041 --> 01:16:58.625
Keep it safe.
I'll take a better look later.

01:16:58.708 --> 01:17:03.624
But the real treasure is getting together
during the festival.

01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:08.541
It's all about having a blast.

01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:16.416
Hail Goddess Durga!

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:19.791
- Subarna?
- Blessings from Goddess Durga, Aunt.

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:21.583
Your 'Kola Bou' song.

01:17:21.666 --> 01:17:24.665
It was actually Durgagoti's clue
to finding the hidden treasure.

01:17:24.666 --> 01:17:25.625
I believe...

01:17:25.626 --> 01:17:30.082
He has kept the clues hidden in the rituals
and traditions of your family.

01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:35.250
Suddenly, I remember a game
my granny taught me.

01:17:35.458 --> 01:17:37.666
A lot like the "Ring around the roses".

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:45.708
Come friends, let's dance together
Let's sing together and make merry

01:17:47.416 --> 01:17:52.500
We'll celebrate Durga festival
To seek Black Moon's emerald

01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:55.165
Show empathy

01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:57.457
Or it vanishes!

01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:58.916
My grandmother also mentioned...

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:02.916
this rhyme was written by Old Grandpa.

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:07.082
Wow! Clues for the treasure
hidden in a rhyme?

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:08.207
Correct.

01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:10.582
Dumble, what do think
"Black Moon's emerald" is?

01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:12.500
Sir, Lord Krishna was referred
to as Black Moon.

01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:13.833
Not in this case.

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:17.125
Your family follows Shaktism,
so there can't be a Krishna reference.

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:19.125
Yeah, that's true.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:21.332
Black Moon literally translates
to Krishna Chandra.

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:22.708
- Wow!
- Oh yes!

01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:25.958
Looks like his brain has freshened up
after the dip in the water.

01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:27.458
Exactly!

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:31.458
So the rhyme is referring to
Krishna Chandra's wealth.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.624
Krishna Chandra went against Siraj
in the Battle of Plassey.

01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:36.707
And Jagat Seth bestowed riches
on him in return.

01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:39.208
But when Mir Qasim ascended the throne
after Mir Jafar...

01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:42.500
He murdered Jagat Seth
without any notice.

01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:45.416
So Krishna Chandra knew he was next.

01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:48.040
That's why a huge part of his wealth
and jewels

01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:50.582
he hid with his good friend,
Durgagoti Deb Roy for safekeeping.

01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:52.040
Here... In Durgeshgarh.

01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:53.457
Oh my God!

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:57.415
That means Krishna Chandra didn't just
come here to start the Durga festival.

01:18:57.416 --> 01:18:59.750
He had come here to keep his wealth safe.

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:01.166
Exactly.

01:19:01.291 --> 01:19:03.458
Dumble, next question.

01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:06.106
What comes first to our mind
when we think of hidden treasure?

01:19:06.833 --> 01:19:08.415
- Gold coins.
- Yes...

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:12.207
But according to Aunt's rhyme,
it's gems and jewellery in this case.

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:14.040
"Black Moon's emerald."

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:18.125
Jagat Seth was the only registered currency
converter in Bengal.

01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:19.374
The mint was his too.

01:19:19.375 --> 01:19:22.708
So, for business transactions
with foreigners

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:27.290
Jagat Seth used to convert their gems
and jewels to currency.

01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:29.207
That's how his treasury got filled up
with gems and jewels.

01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:32.999
He gifted his jewels to Krishna Chandra
who then kept it with Durgagoti.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.207
The rhyme is almost forgotten.
With it the hints too.

01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:40.790
Aunt, if we keep losing
our cultural inheritance

01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:43.072
the hints for the hidden treasures
will also be forgotten.

01:19:43.166 --> 01:19:45.708
So teaching our traditional songs
to our kids is a trick.

01:19:46.666 --> 01:19:50.832
The clues will be passed on
from one generation to the other.

01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:53.666
And if it's not taught,
the clues will be lost forever?

01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:58.833
- Grand Aunty!
- My cutie!

01:19:59.416 --> 01:20:00.416
Okay.

01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:02.625
Boss is a genius!

01:20:02.958 --> 01:20:04.708
Everything about him is so dramatic!

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.208
Guess what he said?

01:20:06.791 --> 01:20:08.875
He is asking
if diving gave you cold feet.

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:11.833
Oh Lyata!

01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:14.083
We need that golden conch, dear.

01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:17.625
Kalu, I'll not leave that lawyer in peace.

01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:19.666
Are you really feeling cold?

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.583
Good.

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.375
Yes.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:27.416
I don't know
why it's being repeated?

01:20:27.708 --> 01:20:28.708
What?

01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:31.916
Hey!

01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:35.291
Stupids!

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.125
Yes, I can hear you.

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:56.332
For your homecoming, Mother
I had lights all over

01:22:56.333 --> 01:23:02.249
Heartbroken I've put them out
Now that you are leaving

01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:08.290
For your homecoming, Mother
I had lights all over

01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:14.083
Heartbroken I've put them out
Now that you are leaving

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:22.790
As you return to Kailash
Leaving us behind

01:23:22.791 --> 01:23:28.958
My heart still yearns
to stay with you longer

01:23:31.791 --> 01:23:37.874
All that remains is the empty backdrop
And a lonely lamp

01:23:37.875 --> 01:23:43.708
How you light up our lives

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:50.166
The drums play a melancholy rhythm

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:56.290
For your homecoming, Mother
I had lights all over

01:23:56.291 --> 01:24:02.250
Heartbroken I've put them out
Now that you are leaving

01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:13.708
Let me adore you one last time
before I bid adieu

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:21.750
We will wait for your homecoming
next Autumn

01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:40.125
- Season's greetings, Jhinuk!
- To you too...

01:24:43.666 --> 01:24:46.458
- May I come in, Nephew?
- Come... Why not?

01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:50.833
- I didn't want to interrupt...
- Sona'da...

01:24:52.208 --> 01:24:53.708
Season's greetings!

01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:57.958
You must touch my feet.

01:24:58.333 --> 01:24:59.333
No way.

01:24:59.625 --> 01:25:02.166
I wish you two all the best.

01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:05.707
I wish Aabir gets to eat everything
on his wedding menu.

01:25:05.708 --> 01:25:07.665
May Jhinuk submit
her research papers soon.

01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.999
May the supervisor create less trouble.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.165
And please...

01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:13.374
Please go to your chamber
a bit more.

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:14.375
Yes!

01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:17.041
I wish Semonti Sarkar stops
making spelling mistakes.

01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:19.665
And she comes back to country
to meet her professor.

01:25:19.666 --> 01:25:20.749
May be she can give him a hug too.

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:22.625
- Excuse me?
- No, it's up to you.

01:25:23.208 --> 01:25:25.666
Now, go look
at the backdrop properly.

01:25:25.833 --> 01:25:26.875
Go on.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.041
Lord Shiva in the middle
with his bull, Nandi.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.875
Ganesha is on Goddess Durga's lap.

01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:34.891
And the rest of it is filled with pictures
of demons being slayed.

01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:37.041
But Sona'da, this is completely different.

01:25:37.125 --> 01:25:39.166
This has a painting of a lake,
river and houses.

01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:41.750
That's impos...

01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:47.291
"If you've seen the Goddess' backdrop
Check the painting in it too".

01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:50.416
"How it all comes together
To become one whole".

01:25:51.416 --> 01:25:51.916
Aunt!

01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:52.916
The backdrop?

01:25:52.917 --> 01:25:54.958
Dharmadas Chitrakar paints it every time.

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:56.926
His family has been doing it
for generations.

01:25:57.166 --> 01:25:58.250
He'll know for sure.

01:25:58.458 --> 01:25:59.957
How long have you been painting
the backdrop?

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:02.082
Since forever, sir.

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:04.750
I've seen my father and grandfather do it.
I follow them.

01:26:04.958 --> 01:26:07.540
My grandfather is still alive
but he is blind now.

01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:08.666
And he's a little crazy...

01:26:08.875 --> 01:26:11.708
Why? Why should I tell you?

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:14.207
You'll take photos.
And write books.

01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:17.499
And we'll continue living
in the darkness.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.000
We imagine but you only make plans.

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:23.041
Get out of here.

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:24.166
But...

01:26:27.166 --> 01:26:28.250
Grandpa...

01:26:28.958 --> 01:26:30.333
Please tell us.

01:26:30.916 --> 01:26:33.875
Who drew the first backdrop
for the Deb Roy mansion?

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:36.124
It's very important, you know.

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:38.082
Old Grandpa!

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:42.915
He's the one who gave the painting
to my grandfather's grandfather.

01:26:42.916 --> 01:26:47.249
One morning, he brought a painting...

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.500
and said...

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.833
Brahmatosh!

01:26:55.333 --> 01:26:56.791
Yes, my lord!

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.540
I want you to paint this
on the Goddess's backdrop.

01:27:01.541 --> 01:27:05.665
I'll make sure
that you'll never be displaced.

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:07.375
You teach this to your son.

01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:09.749
And your son will pass it on to his son.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:14.041
We'll follow the Krishnanagar style
for the idol.

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:17.166
But the backdrop will have my painting.

01:27:17.791 --> 01:27:19.958
What do you think?

01:27:20.375 --> 01:27:23.332
You're a painter, so am I.

01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.625
My goodness!

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:26.458
That means this is a map.

01:27:26.666 --> 01:27:28.208
- Map?
- Yes.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.041
This is the Bonpukuriya Palace.

01:27:31.291 --> 01:27:32.666
Season's greetings!

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:36.541
- Apu, this is a map.
- Map!

01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:37.916
- Map?
- Map?

01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:40.290
Yes, see for yourself.
Bonpukuriya's Palace.

01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:41.416
That's the tomb.

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:44.332
Riverside, boundary wall...
And beyond that...

01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:45.833
That's Dil Dighi lake.

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:47.791
- Is there a forest around?
- Yes, there is.

01:27:47.916 --> 01:27:49.083
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.250
And that's Bhalook Dungri.

01:27:51.583 --> 01:27:54.041
Right there is the Durgeshgarh Fort!

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:56.333
And Raja Krishna Chandra's statue.

01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:58.250
And the tank!

01:27:58.416 --> 01:28:03.000
Great technology, you know!
Water never dries up!

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:06.582
Wow! A tank that never runs out of water?

01:28:06.583 --> 01:28:08.541
Can we go there?

01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:11.165
I know it like the back of my hand.

01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:12.290
Let's go!

01:28:12.291 --> 01:28:15.457
What turn of events!
The backdrop has turned into a map!

01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:16.916
Badaboom!

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:25.583
(singing)

01:28:27.958 --> 01:28:30.250
- Dumble...
- Oh no!

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:34.291
- Get off the car, Kucho.
- No, Uncle. I want to go with you.

01:28:34.333 --> 01:28:37.915
Kids don't go to the forest. Do they?

01:28:37.916 --> 01:28:39.666
Good boy, get off.

01:28:39.791 --> 01:28:43.957
But I want to go with Jhinuk.

01:28:43.958 --> 01:28:44.833
- Oh my God!
- Jhinuk?

01:28:44.834 --> 01:28:48.165
- Let him come with us.
- Yes, a drive with Jhinuk Aunty.

01:28:48.166 --> 01:28:51.249
- But we're going to the forest...
- Not aunty, only Jhinuk.

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:54.333
- Nakul Uncle, start the car.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:57.207
Start the car or you'll lose your job.

01:28:57.208 --> 01:28:58.666
Let's go.

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.250
Let's go.

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:08.375
They are going on a quest for gold
in the forest.

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:11.583
Go, distract them.

01:29:25.083 --> 01:29:32.541
(singing)

01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:35.166
It's beautiful!

01:29:38.166 --> 01:29:40.999
- Kucho, stop!
- Just look at him.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.250
- I warned against this.
- But it's fun being in forest.

01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:58.625
Kucho! Wait! Kucho!

01:29:59.666 --> 01:30:05.416
Professor, this way.
I'll show you something interesting.

01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:13.083
Elephants used to be tied up
to these pillars.

01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:15.665
I've seen this emblem somewhere.

01:30:15.666 --> 01:30:18.707
This is Durgeshgarh Estate's emblem.
It's everywhere.

01:30:18.708 --> 01:30:20.708
Have you noticed
what is written below it?

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.416
That's Ramprasadi song.

01:30:22.666 --> 01:30:29.624
There won't be time, Mother...

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:30.957
Durgagoti's dagger!

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:33.249
- What?
- But we don't have the dagger anymore, sir.

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:35.415
There's a replica.
No harm in trying.

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:36.416
One minute.

01:30:37.125 --> 01:30:39.750
Hello. I'm calling from Bonpukuriya.

01:30:40.125 --> 01:30:43.416
Don't you have a replica
of the Deb Roy dagger?

01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:47.000
Yes... Can you bring it here
with you?

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.500
It's very urgent. It'll take you
around three hours to get here.

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:52.000
Yes, please.

01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:55.416
I'll explain everything to you
when you get here.

01:30:56.416 --> 01:30:59.291
The game is afoot.

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:00.500
Okay.

01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:02.375
Call me the moment you reach.
Thank you.

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.083
Hello!

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:07.707
Dagger... replica... game...

01:31:07.708 --> 01:31:10.165
Looks like everything
is going badaboom!

01:31:10.166 --> 01:31:12.832
Have you paid attention
to the Durgeshgarh Estate's emblem?

01:31:12.833 --> 01:31:14.166
Since I was a kid.

01:31:14.666 --> 01:31:19.583
I'm Tarzan! I'm Mowgli!

01:31:20.583 --> 01:31:24.833
Kucho, stop running!
Aabir, keep up.

01:31:28.166 --> 01:31:29.500
Kucho, wait!

01:31:31.583 --> 01:31:34.875
Kucho, don't run away.
Kucho, wait!

01:31:35.041 --> 01:31:36.708
Kucho, stop running!

01:31:41.333 --> 01:31:45.416
He doesn't sit even for a moment.
I'm burning too many calories.

01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:51.333
Kucho! Hey, Kucho! Stop!

01:31:58.958 --> 01:32:03.541
Professor, this is
the Bhalook Dungri's mound.

01:32:03.916 --> 01:32:07.040
You'll still find bears here.

01:32:07.041 --> 01:32:10.415
Durgeshgarh Palace is on the other side
of this forest.

01:32:10.416 --> 01:32:12.625
Where did these three disappear?

01:32:13.125 --> 01:32:17.083
Dumble, Aabir's phone is unreachable.

01:32:17.916 --> 01:32:20.790
Aabir! Jhinuk!

01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:22.874
- That's why I didn't want to bring the kid.
- Sir, I'll check this side.

01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:26.791
- Okay, call me once you find them.
- I'll go this way.

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:28.291
Aabir!

01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:30.750
Kucho!

01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:32.916
Kucho!

01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:37.375
Aabir!

01:32:38.791 --> 01:32:40.083
Jhinuk!

01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:47.625
Damn!

01:32:55.666 --> 01:32:57.416
Kucho!

01:32:59.416 --> 01:33:00.583
Kucho!

01:33:01.416 --> 01:33:03.250
Kucho!

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.708
Kucho!

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:09.250
These youngsters!

01:33:10.458 --> 01:33:11.458
Kucho!

01:33:12.625 --> 01:33:13.916
Jhinuk!

01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:17.000
Aabir!

01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:33.000
Aabir!

01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:36.375
Jhinuk!

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:02.082
Did you find them?

01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:03.249
They are nowhere to be seen.

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:05.165
This is not a good sign.

01:34:05.166 --> 01:34:08.915
- What if they fall inside one of the caves...
- I don't know what'll happen...

01:34:08.916 --> 01:34:11.040
I think we should go home
and let my elder brother know.

01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:12.208
Goes without saying.

01:34:12.291 --> 01:34:15.750
- Why did you bring Kucho?
- You saw how adamant he was.

01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:18.666
Someone pushed you from behind?

01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:21.416
I didn't even realise someone
was following me.

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:23.250
Be careful, Kucho!

01:34:29.791 --> 01:34:32.165
No network.
That's why I couldn't call you.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.290
- Did you get hurt, Sona'da?
- No...

01:34:33.291 --> 01:34:35.207
I didn't get hurt at all.

01:34:35.208 --> 01:34:38.332
I eat spinach like Popeye.

01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:39.833
Give me a hand.

01:34:43.583 --> 01:34:44.915
What will we do now?

01:34:44.916 --> 01:34:48.208
Aabir, I think, this is the only way out.

01:34:48.708 --> 01:34:50.707
I'll look after them.
You climb the wall carefully.

01:34:50.708 --> 01:34:52.166
Hold on to Kucho.

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:53.499
Are you okay?

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:54.625
Okay.

01:34:56.083 --> 01:34:57.000
Hold on to the roots.

01:34:57.001 --> 01:35:00.208
Can't you shoot webs
like Spiderman?

01:35:00.916 --> 01:35:01.666
It's okay. Just climb.

01:35:01.667 --> 01:35:03.375
Be quiet now, Kucho.

01:35:06.375 --> 01:35:07.375
Carefully.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.041
Aabir!

01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:19.291
- What is it?
- Hand.

01:35:21.083 --> 01:35:22.083
Wait, I'll come up.

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.291
No need. I can do it.

01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:34.208
Underwater kick, huh?
Now I'll cut these roots.

01:35:34.666 --> 01:35:37.333
- Aabir!
- Hey! Hey!

01:35:37.583 --> 01:35:40.374
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Stop it!

01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:43.458
- Sona'da, help Aabir.
- Sona'da!

01:35:43.583 --> 01:35:45.750
- Aabir!
- Aabir!

01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:49.333
Yeah, Phantom!

01:35:52.416 --> 01:35:53.000
Hello?

01:35:53.041 --> 01:35:54.915
Hello, Doctor!

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:56.333
We want the golden conch.

01:35:56.666 --> 01:35:57.375
Who is this?

01:35:57.416 --> 01:36:00.125
You've invited guests from Kolkata.

01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:02.583
But you couldn't protect them.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:03.875
What are you talking about?

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:06.125
Take the conch from your aunt.

01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:07.666
And hand it over to us.

01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:08.333
What?

01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:13.000
Don't you want Kucho
to come back home?

01:36:13.083 --> 01:36:15.083
He left such a long time back...

01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:18.541
We'll be at the old temple
on the forest's edge.

01:36:19.708 --> 01:36:20.208
Otherwise...

01:36:20.209 --> 01:36:22.666
The bears at Bhalook Dungri...

01:36:22.875 --> 01:36:25.708
Anything can happen.

01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:30.375
And I'm sure you know
you can't inform the police.

01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:32.875
Okay? Bye.

01:36:33.833 --> 01:36:34.833
My God!

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.249
Why did you take the kid...

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:50.124
Exactly! They are dumb!
They don't have brains.

01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:51.125
You're very smart.

01:36:51.126 --> 01:36:52.665
You pretend to be a part of the family.

01:36:52.666 --> 01:36:56.040
Didn't it occur to you not to take a kid
to the forest?

01:36:56.041 --> 01:36:58.791
- Calm down...
- Why should I?

01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:03.875
I kept warning you about the outsiders.
Now see the mess we're in.

01:37:05.375 --> 01:37:07.625
It's my son.
I'll figure something out.

01:37:07.666 --> 01:37:10.041
Stop crying.
I'll bring our son back.

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:11.374
But we won't give the conch.

01:37:11.375 --> 01:37:14.416
- Shuli, they are our guests.
- So what?

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.082
Why do you invite such people?

01:37:17.083 --> 01:37:17.625
What nonsense!

01:37:17.708 --> 01:37:19.809
My son has been kidnapped.
Now the conch will disappear.

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:23.583
- But they did it for us...
- What did they do?

01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:26.332
What did they do?
What's wrong with them?

01:37:26.333 --> 01:37:28.333
Do you think they risked everything for us?

01:37:28.458 --> 01:37:31.458
If they find the treasure,
they're going to keep it.

01:37:31.541 --> 01:37:33.541
They are nothing but criminals, smugglers.

01:37:33.583 --> 01:37:34.958
What are you saying, Shuli?

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.790
They are in danger.

01:37:36.791 --> 01:37:38.333
Guests should behave like guests.

01:37:38.375 --> 01:37:40.207
Or else, they'll be in danger.

01:37:40.208 --> 01:37:41.540
They've crossed the limits.

01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.582
Dumble, take the conch.

01:37:43.583 --> 01:37:45.958
And keep it where they asked you
to keep it.

01:37:47.083 --> 01:37:49.290
- Give it to me.
- Let go of the conch.

01:37:49.291 --> 01:37:52.165
- Stop being immature.
- Let it go, brother.

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.582
- But you are being immature.
- Please keep quiet.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:56.583
Another outsider you have encouraged.

01:37:56.750 --> 01:38:00.041
Have you ever listened to me?
Have you ever heard me out?

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:03.226
You're fighting with me for three outsiders.
You'll find out it's not worth it.

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:04.707
- They don't get it.
- Let's talk later...

01:38:04.708 --> 01:38:09.290
Shuli, don't discuss something
you don't understand.

01:38:09.291 --> 01:38:13.583
If Subarna didn't find it,
you still wouldn't have the conch.

01:38:13.708 --> 01:38:15.832
- Dumble, do as I say.
- She's right.

01:38:15.833 --> 01:38:18.666
- Keep it exactly where they asked.
- They'll never understand.

01:38:19.208 --> 01:38:21.832
Kalu, we'll have to find Kucho.

01:38:21.833 --> 01:38:24.500
I'll find my son on my own. Okay.

01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:26.041
But I'll see you.

01:38:27.416 --> 01:38:28.458
Just wait.

01:38:28.625 --> 01:38:29.833
Shuli!

01:38:30.666 --> 01:38:32.541
You better hurry.

01:38:32.583 --> 01:38:33.791
We'll join you.

01:38:34.333 --> 01:38:35.708
This guy I tell you.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.665
Jhinuk, I watched this in Mowgli.

01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:41.541
Baloo the Bear.

01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:43.499
- Kucho!
- Kucho!

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:44.666
- Kucho!
- Kucho!

01:38:44.791 --> 01:38:46.832
Wow! Real Baloo!

01:38:46.833 --> 01:38:49.333
- Sona'da, it's a bear.
- Jhinuk, be careful.

01:38:49.416 --> 01:38:50.875
Jhinuk, send Kucho here.

01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:53.541
Jhinuk, oh no!

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:55.250
Go that way.

01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:59.415
Jhinuk, don't be scared.

01:38:59.416 --> 01:39:03.625
Play dead. Don't breathe.
Don't open your eyes. Close your eyes.

01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:40.583
Aabir, do you see any stones?

01:39:41.666 --> 01:39:42.500
Throw them at the wall.

01:39:42.501 --> 01:39:44.333
- Shouldn't hit her.
- Okay.

01:39:54.333 --> 01:39:56.333
Aabir! Jhinuk!

01:39:57.125 --> 01:39:58.541
- Aabir!
- Get up!

01:40:02.958 --> 01:40:03.958
Kick it down.

01:40:04.875 --> 01:40:06.875
It'll break. Keep kicking.

01:40:10.875 --> 01:40:12.125
Kucho! Come here!

01:40:22.791 --> 01:40:24.499
Jhinuk, keep Kucho close.

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.957
Aabir, I think there's another way.
I can see light.

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:28.000
Let's go, Kucho!

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:42.500
Let me hold Kucho.

01:40:44.708 --> 01:40:46.583
- Let's go.
- Come on.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:48.500
This way.

01:40:55.583 --> 01:40:57.916
- Come this way.
- Be careful.

01:40:58.916 --> 01:41:00.291
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:41:03.833 --> 01:41:05.166
Watch your step.

01:42:01.291 --> 01:42:02.915
What are you doing here, Dumble?

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:05.208
Sir, what are you doing here? Kucho?

01:42:05.625 --> 01:42:07.165
- But I just left the conch...
- Conch?

01:42:07.166 --> 01:42:09.165
They called and asked us to leave the conch
and take Kucho.

01:42:09.166 --> 01:42:10.416
Who called you?

01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:13.124
- Where is it?
- I just left it inside.

01:42:13.125 --> 01:42:14.583
Come with me now.

01:42:15.166 --> 01:42:16.000
Hold my hand, Kucho.

01:42:16.041 --> 01:42:17.458
Where did you keep it?

01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:25.875
Underwater kick?

01:42:29.458 --> 01:42:30.458
Go!

01:42:57.291 --> 01:42:59.291
- Let's go.
- Kucho, come.

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:00.832
Give me the keys for the bike.

01:43:00.833 --> 01:43:02.583
I'm going ahead with Kucho.

01:43:03.083 --> 01:43:04.083
Kucho!

01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:06.958
- Jhinuk, come with me.
- Yeah.

01:43:07.208 --> 01:43:08.458
Hurry.

01:43:09.458 --> 01:43:10.999
They won't hurt Kucho, right?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.375
- Subarno is there. He'll do something.
- Don't worry.

01:43:14.541 --> 01:43:16.083
Nakul, get the car.

01:43:29.833 --> 01:43:31.957
Jhinuk, that's their car.

01:43:31.958 --> 01:43:36.000
- That's them. Stop the car.
- There they are.

01:43:37.041 --> 01:43:38.750
Kucho! Get off the bike.

01:43:39.208 --> 01:43:40.541
- Kucho!
- Mom!

01:43:40.791 --> 01:43:42.666
- Mom!
- Kucho!

01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:44.833
Kucho, my baby...

01:43:45.916 --> 01:43:48.125
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?

01:43:49.125 --> 01:43:51.625
You've got a cut here.
Tedback is a must.

01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:54.875
If anything happened to Kucho today...

01:43:55.166 --> 01:43:57.458
I would have killed Subarna and Apu.

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.791
Why are you staring at me.
Look at his wound.

01:43:59.875 --> 01:44:00.916
Here you are.

01:44:01.958 --> 01:44:02.625
Are you okay?

01:44:02.626 --> 01:44:05.250
Aunt, the conch.

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.916
Hail Goddess Durga!

01:44:10.416 --> 01:44:13.791
Subarna, you're a part of the family now.

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:18.250
And family members become strangers.

01:44:18.958 --> 01:44:21.832
Captain America, are you feeling better
after mom's hugs?

01:44:21.833 --> 01:44:28.165
Mom, when the bear came in front of Jhinuk
she fell down.

01:44:28.166 --> 01:44:30.374
It was sniffing her.

01:44:30.375 --> 01:44:33.290
Have you watched
'Beauty and the Beast'?

01:44:33.291 --> 01:44:34.999
No need to go to the forest
to see beasts anymore.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
They are all around us.

01:44:37.875 --> 01:44:40.082
I know you meant it for me.

01:44:40.083 --> 01:44:42.208
I'm the black sheep
of the family anyway.

01:44:42.333 --> 01:44:44.707
Let's get out of here.

01:44:44.708 --> 01:44:45.416
Come.

01:44:45.417 --> 01:44:48.166
- Go with them.
- Okay. Let's go.

01:44:50.416 --> 01:44:53.333
Sona'da, Operation Durgeshgarh dismissed?

01:44:53.583 --> 01:44:54.790
No, no.

01:44:54.791 --> 01:44:56.457
The Durgeshgarh emblem...

01:44:56.458 --> 01:44:58.124
The black moon on top

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.125
then the water

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.499
the lotus at the bottom
and two lions on either side and

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.665
the dagger...

01:45:02.666 --> 01:45:06.040
I'm certain, there's treasure hidden
somewhere in Durgeshgarh.

01:45:06.041 --> 01:45:08.791
- If the black moon is Krishna Chandra...
- Exactly.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.249
You said there's a statue
of Krishna Chandra here.

01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:15.708
That's right in front of the palace.

01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:19.040
The emblem is etched on the pedestal.

01:45:19.041 --> 01:45:20.624
I can take you there
with my eyes closed.

01:45:20.625 --> 01:45:23.375
Why don't you just leave, Apu?

01:45:23.875 --> 01:45:25.665
The festival is over.
What else?

01:45:25.666 --> 01:45:27.749
You don't have to be
their local guide anymore.

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:28.583
We're here.

01:45:28.584 --> 01:45:30.207
Frankly speaking, they are our guests.

01:45:30.208 --> 01:45:32.457
This is our estate.
We'll take care of this. Okay.

01:45:32.458 --> 01:45:33.666
Please leave.

01:45:36.166 --> 01:45:37.958
That's it then.

01:45:38.291 --> 01:45:41.291
Shuli will take you there.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.040
I should leave now.

01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:45.333
I can beat the traffic.

01:45:45.458 --> 01:45:46.749
Bye, Aabir.

01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:48.290
Come to my Kolkata home with Jhinuk.

01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:49.957
Say something.

01:45:49.958 --> 01:45:52.749
We'll eat a lot!

01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:54.500
Bye, Professor. Dumble...

01:45:55.166 --> 01:45:57.166
- Bless me, Aunt. Goodbye.
- Take care.

01:46:00.833 --> 01:46:02.958
It's a very busy life in the city.

01:46:04.208 --> 01:46:06.500
The festival was an excuse to visit.

01:46:08.458 --> 01:46:10.250
But that's gone too now.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.208
Bye.

01:46:19.125 --> 01:46:20.125
Good.

01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:21.540
So, Professor Sen.

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:24.291
You should head back to the city too.
The festival is over.

01:46:24.625 --> 01:46:28.333
We will find the hidden treasure
if there's any.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:33.582
Oh and Aabir! No vegetarian food today.
There's fish and mutton.

01:46:33.583 --> 01:46:35.166
Please eat before leaving.

01:46:36.125 --> 01:46:37.833
Wait, Subarna.

01:46:39.041 --> 01:46:41.708
Shuli, there's a limit
to how rude you can be.

01:46:41.791 --> 01:46:43.250
Who do you think you are?

01:46:43.291 --> 01:46:46.874
I'll decide when they'll leave
and where they'll stay.

01:46:46.875 --> 01:46:48.166
Right.

01:46:48.375 --> 01:46:51.166
Durgagoti's property will be divided
into four parts not three.

01:46:51.208 --> 01:46:52.333
- Shuli!
- Just shut up!

01:46:52.375 --> 01:46:53.791
- Shuli.
- What is he saying?

01:46:53.833 --> 01:46:55.875
- Are you okay in the head?
- Yes, I am.

01:46:56.166 --> 01:46:59.332
Do you think your doctor's mind will be
enough to handle the hidden treasure?

01:46:59.333 --> 01:47:00.957
Or his knowledge of history will help?

01:47:00.958 --> 01:47:02.207
This is something different.

01:47:02.208 --> 01:47:03.375
I'm a civil engineer.

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:05.267
I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Just trust me.

01:47:05.291 --> 01:47:07.333
Professor Sen, why don't you leave?

01:47:07.583 --> 01:47:09.291
Subarna.

01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:11.833
Don't show off your education.

01:47:11.875 --> 01:47:15.375
No one could decipher Durgagoti's hints
for so many years.

01:47:18.791 --> 01:47:20.457
- Please go ahead, Subarna.
- What do you mean?

01:47:20.458 --> 01:47:23.500
I know you'll be successful.
My blessings are with you.

01:47:23.541 --> 01:47:25.083
You're crossing all limits, Aunt!

01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:26.833
- Dumble.
- What the hell?

01:47:26.916 --> 01:47:27.625
Yes, Aunt.

01:47:27.626 --> 01:47:28.790
Go with them.

01:47:28.791 --> 01:47:29.666
Keep this with you.

01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:30.957
Aren't you going to say anything?

01:47:30.958 --> 01:47:32.041
Keep this.

01:47:34.083 --> 01:47:35.583
- See you soon, dear.
- Bye, Aunt.

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:36.666
Wow!

01:47:36.667 --> 01:47:38.000
Let's go, Aabir.

01:47:38.583 --> 01:47:40.250
I'll see how this ends.

01:47:40.583 --> 01:47:42.708
Let's see who finds
the hidden treasure first.

01:47:43.375 --> 01:47:44.875
May the Goddess be with them.

01:47:47.791 --> 01:47:52.374
Sona'da, Aabir, Jhinuk
The trio is back

01:47:52.375 --> 01:47:54.625
On a quest to find hidden treasure

01:48:04.458 --> 01:48:06.083
Aabir, stop the car.

01:48:11.875 --> 01:48:12.916
What is it, Dumble?

01:48:13.041 --> 01:48:14.916
I know a short cut through here.

01:48:15.166 --> 01:48:16.916
Show us. Let's go.

01:48:21.208 --> 01:48:22.208
Watch your step.

01:49:29.166 --> 01:49:30.166
This way.

01:49:38.291 --> 01:49:39.291
Sir!

01:49:40.833 --> 01:49:41.833
I'll show you!

01:49:57.541 --> 01:49:58.708
Yes!

01:50:17.666 --> 01:50:18.666
Sir!

01:51:01.875 --> 01:51:03.750
Aparup!

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.791
Apu?

01:51:07.375 --> 01:51:09.665
The family that accepted you
as their own son...

01:51:09.666 --> 01:51:11.291
Aren't you ashamed of betraying them?

01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:16.915
Aparup Chandra is intelligent
that's why he depended on your brain.

01:51:16.916 --> 01:51:19.332
Moreover, you're not a detective.

01:51:19.333 --> 01:51:22.082
Naturally, you trusted me.

01:51:22.083 --> 01:51:23.208
Exactly.

01:51:23.416 --> 01:51:25.582
I should have never trusted you.

01:51:25.583 --> 01:51:26.958
That's what happens.

01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:30.291
Good people are born
to make mistakes.

01:51:31.541 --> 01:51:33.541
Hey, Nakul.

01:51:33.708 --> 01:51:36.916
Show them what you got.

01:51:54.916 --> 01:51:55.916
Aabir, don't!

01:51:57.166 --> 01:51:58.541
Aabir!

01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:24.416
No! No! No!

01:52:57.666 --> 01:53:01.416
What an idiot!
Hey! No! No! No!

01:53:01.458 --> 01:53:04.207
That's not looking good on you.
Drop it.

01:53:04.208 --> 01:53:06.083
Come on. Do it now.

01:53:08.708 --> 01:53:11.124
All of Krishna Chandra's wealth
will be mine.

01:53:11.125 --> 01:53:13.125
Only mine!

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:19.958
I've given up a lot, Mr. Sen.

01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:22.124
I didn't join my family business.

01:53:22.125 --> 01:53:24.332
I've studied this family's history
for years.

01:53:24.333 --> 01:53:27.333
Just so Krishna Chandra's
hidden treasure will be mine.

01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:29.750
Today is my day!

01:53:30.583 --> 01:53:32.500
What is this?

01:53:33.541 --> 01:53:35.165
This is the key.

01:53:35.166 --> 01:53:36.500
And there's the lock.

01:53:36.875 --> 01:53:40.000
Nothing in life is meaningless.

01:53:41.375 --> 01:53:42.375
Yes!

01:53:42.833 --> 01:53:43.833
Yes!

01:53:50.708 --> 01:53:52.375
Sona'da...

01:54:04.208 --> 01:54:05.625
Sona'da!

01:54:43.708 --> 01:54:45.250
Now what?

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.125
How will I get in?

01:54:48.458 --> 01:54:51.333
Damn it! Where's the key?

01:54:57.625 --> 01:55:00.457
What's the matter, Mr. Black Sheep?
Is that all?

01:55:00.458 --> 01:55:04.040
You thought you'll scare us with your gun
and the treasure will be yours.

01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:06.708
Okay, I accept that you're smart
and I'm dumb.

01:55:06.791 --> 01:55:07.791
Open the door.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.707
Why should I do it
for someone like you?

01:55:09.708 --> 01:55:11.082
Of course, you will!

01:55:11.083 --> 01:55:12.791
Tagore had written...

01:55:12.916 --> 01:55:15.374
"Tigers in the forest
Birds in trees".

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:17.040
'Bears live in caves."

01:55:17.041 --> 01:55:18.540
- And here is Kali.
- Kalu, you?

01:55:18.541 --> 01:55:20.124
Sir, please don't tell them.

01:55:20.125 --> 01:55:21.625
- Sir, please don't.
- Shut up.

01:55:23.208 --> 01:55:24.624
Just shut up!

01:55:24.625 --> 01:55:27.125
Not another word.
Open the door now!

01:55:27.625 --> 01:55:28.833
Open the door!

01:55:30.958 --> 01:55:32.290
- Move aside.
- What?

01:55:32.291 --> 01:55:34.416
Knowing the history is not enough
to get the treasure.

01:55:34.625 --> 01:55:36.040
You must know the ancient texts too.

01:55:36.041 --> 01:55:38.250
Are Goddess Durga's animals
in the right order?

01:55:38.916 --> 01:55:41.083
Durga? Animals?

01:55:41.875 --> 01:55:44.458
Combination lock. Move!

01:55:49.125 --> 01:55:53.166
The owl moves to the left.

01:55:53.916 --> 01:55:56.041
The swan replaces the owl.

01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:00.666
Peacock comes in where the swan was.

01:56:00.875 --> 01:56:03.416
And the rat in the peacock's place.

01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:06.249
So, owl on the left,
the mouse below it.

01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:07.582
The swan and peacock on the right.

01:56:07.583 --> 01:56:08.875
And the lion in the middle.

01:56:08.916 --> 01:56:09.750
So what?

01:56:09.751 --> 01:56:12.374
You've waited so long
for the hidden treasure.

01:56:12.375 --> 01:56:13.708
Just wait a little longer.

01:56:13.875 --> 01:56:17.750
Now the lion will slay the buffalo demon.

01:56:34.541 --> 01:56:36.165
It's really chilly down here.

01:56:36.166 --> 01:56:39.000
That means the water from the tank upstairs
is flowing down.

01:57:00.583 --> 01:57:04.915
The legend of Krishna Chandra
comes alive in the emblem above

01:57:04.916 --> 01:57:09.290
The lotus blooms in the hidden recesses
of the cave

01:57:09.291 --> 01:57:13.624
The mystical darkness
engulfs the sleepy cave

01:57:13.625 --> 01:57:19.250
Durgeshgarh resurfaces
from the hidden abyss

01:57:19.833 --> 01:57:22.040
Durgagoti's secret chamber!

01:57:22.041 --> 01:57:23.166
Yes!

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.083
Can you understand the meaning
of Durgeshgarh's emblem now?

01:57:27.416 --> 01:57:30.625
The statue of Krishna Chandra above
and the clay lotus below.

01:57:32.291 --> 01:57:35.458
Krishna Chandra and Durgagoti,
the closest of friends...

01:57:35.541 --> 01:57:36.957
Scared of being killed by Mir Qasim

01:57:36.958 --> 01:57:39.708
all the wealth he received
from Jagat Seth

01:57:39.875 --> 01:57:42.124
Krishna Chandra hid it with Durgagoti.

01:57:42.125 --> 01:57:45.458
And the Durga festival
was also initiated by him.

01:57:45.666 --> 01:57:50.332
And Durgagoti hid the clues in the rituals.

01:57:50.333 --> 01:57:52.125
Hey, Mr. Sen.

01:57:52.625 --> 01:57:54.207
I'm not here for your stories.

01:57:54.208 --> 01:57:55.832
Where is the hidden treasure?

01:57:55.833 --> 01:57:57.208
Right here.

01:57:57.583 --> 01:58:00.040
The gold jewellery on the idol.

01:58:00.041 --> 01:58:01.832
You should know gold pretty well.

01:58:01.833 --> 01:58:07.457
I have grown up with gold.
So don't try to teach me about it.

01:58:07.458 --> 01:58:09.499
Where is the real treasure?

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.082
Where's Krishna Chanra's gems and jewels?

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:16.749
The way you've become your greed
will never be satiated.

01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:19.499
Why are you so greedy?

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.500
Greed? Greed?

01:58:22.083 --> 01:58:23.083
Aabir!

01:58:23.875 --> 01:58:25.915
Don't try anything smart.

01:58:25.916 --> 01:58:27.499
No sudden moves!

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:32.207
If I don't find the treasure,
I'll sacrifice all of you.

01:58:32.208 --> 01:58:33.916
- Kalu?
- Yes, boss!

01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.375
Sona'da!

01:58:43.625 --> 01:58:45.624
- Where are you going?
- Catch him!

01:58:45.625 --> 01:58:46.749
He's the one who stole the dagger.

01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:49.040
- What are you saying?
- He is with him.

01:58:49.041 --> 01:58:51.540
How dare you?

01:58:51.541 --> 01:58:53.915
I trusted you.
Arrest him.

01:58:53.916 --> 01:58:54.999
Trishulpani!

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
The chief conspirator is here.

01:58:57.875 --> 01:58:59.541
What are you saying, Professor Sen?

01:59:01.416 --> 01:59:02.583
Unfortunately so.

01:59:03.083 --> 01:59:04.458
Unbelievable!

01:59:05.125 --> 01:59:10.333
Apu, my family...
I'm the bad boy of the family.

01:59:10.583 --> 01:59:12.582
Professor Sen, then the dagger?

01:59:12.583 --> 01:59:14.832
We don't need the replica anymore,
Inspector Sarkar.

01:59:14.833 --> 01:59:16.290
We've found the real dagger.

01:59:16.291 --> 01:59:17.915
But first come here.

01:59:17.916 --> 01:59:21.083
- You've met him before, right?
- Bonbihari Giri?

01:59:21.416 --> 01:59:22.500
Correct.

01:59:22.666 --> 01:59:24.291
Believers say...

01:59:24.583 --> 01:59:28.166
if the incantations are not done properly
the gods don't respond.

01:59:29.166 --> 01:59:30.875
Sometimes...

01:59:31.625 --> 01:59:33.875
it's the other way around.

01:59:33.958 --> 01:59:35.458
Arrest him, Inspector Sarkar.

01:59:36.166 --> 01:59:37.833
But just wait for a bit.

01:59:38.208 --> 01:59:41.500
He's always lusted after
Durgeshgarh's hidden treasure.

01:59:41.583 --> 01:59:43.124
He won't get his hands on it.

01:59:43.125 --> 01:59:44.833
He can, at least, see it.

02:00:17.625 --> 02:00:19.333
Trishulpani!

02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:23.666
This is the Deb Roy
family's hidden treasure.

02:00:23.791 --> 02:00:26.083
The hidden treasure of Durgeshgarh.

02:00:26.291 --> 02:00:27.583
Come up.

02:00:27.875 --> 02:00:32.583
Hopefully you remember
which weapon is carried in which hand.

02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:35.790
You didn't even learn it.

02:00:35.791 --> 02:00:36.958
Dumble?

02:00:37.416 --> 02:00:39.125
Don't remember all of them.

02:00:42.416 --> 02:00:46.083
If you don't learn the songs
or see the paintings...

02:00:46.625 --> 02:00:49.332
Which animal goes with which deity
or where do the weapons go...

02:00:49.333 --> 02:00:53.083
If you don't know these,
the door to the secret chamber won't open.

02:00:53.291 --> 02:00:57.791
Now let's see, "How it all comes together
To become one whole."

02:00:59.750 --> 02:01:01.874
- Mr. TMT!
- Yes.

02:01:01.875 --> 02:01:04.290
Do you remember the order of the weapons?

02:01:04.291 --> 02:01:05.374
Yes!

02:01:05.375 --> 02:01:08.083
The disc goes on top.

02:01:31.666 --> 02:01:33.750
Below that the thunder.

02:01:45.666 --> 02:01:47.500
Next is the trident.

02:01:55.125 --> 02:01:56.416
Then the lotus.

02:02:05.458 --> 02:02:07.333
The spectre at the end.

02:02:16.375 --> 02:02:18.500
The snake at the bottom.

02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:25.208
The axe above it.

02:02:29.291 --> 02:02:30.875
Bow and arrow.

02:02:50.416 --> 02:02:52.040
- Jhinuk?
- Yes, Sona'da.

02:02:52.041 --> 02:02:53.415
The conch.

02:02:53.416 --> 02:02:55.291
Of course, Sona'da.

02:03:03.333 --> 02:03:05.791
Come, Trishulpani.

02:03:06.125 --> 02:03:07.833
This is yours.

02:03:09.458 --> 02:03:10.458
Please.

02:03:48.416 --> 02:03:49.916
Hidden treasure!

02:04:43.625 --> 02:04:45.124
Thank you so much, Inspector!

02:04:45.125 --> 02:04:46.791
Please don't embarass me.

02:04:46.916 --> 02:04:50.332
I am feeling relieved
that I could give you your treasure back.

02:04:50.333 --> 02:04:51.666
Safe travels.

02:04:51.958 --> 02:04:54.291
- Okay, Mr. Sen.
- Thank you very much.

02:04:54.333 --> 02:04:56.416
- Let's meet in Kolkata.
- Definitely!

02:04:56.833 --> 02:04:57.791
Goodbye.

02:04:57.833 --> 02:04:59.500
- Jhinuk!
- Yes.

02:04:59.583 --> 02:05:01.208
Come here.

02:05:02.166 --> 02:05:07.208
This is a gift for your upcoming wedding
from the Deb Roy family.

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:08.500
Take it.

02:05:08.833 --> 02:05:11.583
You have to accept gifts from elders.

02:05:12.083 --> 02:05:13.083
- Please take it.
- Come on.

02:05:13.084 --> 02:05:18.375
- What about Aabir's gift?
- Right.

02:05:18.833 --> 02:05:20.708
Aabir, come here.

02:05:21.416 --> 02:05:23.250
Go on...

02:05:23.583 --> 02:05:25.666
You don't have to do that.

02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:30.790
But we'll have to hand this over
to the government.

02:05:30.791 --> 02:05:33.250
We know,
it's the Goverment of India's property.

02:05:33.333 --> 02:05:34.166
So what?

02:05:34.167 --> 02:05:36.790
There's no harm in giving them
a couple of jewelleries.

02:05:36.791 --> 02:05:42.874
I'm sure even after the government takes most of
it, we'll have enough for the festival expenses.

02:05:42.875 --> 02:05:45.125
That's okay but I was thinking this time...

02:05:45.291 --> 02:05:46.457
I'll come back for good.

02:05:46.458 --> 02:05:47.665
- What?
- Really?

02:05:47.666 --> 02:05:49.916
- Shuli?
- I've thought about it.

02:05:54.791 --> 02:05:56.511
- Take a look at this...
- But why did he...

02:06:01.666 --> 02:06:02.749
Hello?

02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:05.166
Sir, I've submitted my dissertation.

02:06:05.458 --> 02:06:07.125
Thank you so much for your help.

02:06:07.307 --> 02:06:09.625
I'm coming to Kolkata on a project, sir.

02:06:09.791 --> 02:06:11.172
Missed the festival a lot.

02:06:11.197 --> 02:06:12.362
Are you there?

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.360
Hello!
