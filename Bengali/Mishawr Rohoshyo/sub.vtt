WEBVTT

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.167
We see Sphinx and we see
great pyramid of Khufu!

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:10.500
We see famous pyramid of Kafre.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.667
Now, not very famous
but very interesting tomb.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:18.000
Come. Come with me.
Come. Come.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.958
Mind your step. Come
please. This way.

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.708
Careful. Careful.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:26.792
One by one. Come. Careful.
Mind your step please.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.792
Come carefully.

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.917
This is the tomb of
queen Hetepheres

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.833
or you can call it the
'Ghost Tomb'.

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:37.042
Careful madam, careful.

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:39.125
No sir, no picture
inside the tunnel please.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.208
Come with me, I'll tell you
why it is a Ghost Pyramid.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.958
This way, careful. And we
will reach the main hall.

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:50.750
Ladies and gentleman,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.458
Queen Hetepheres!

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.208
Sometimes Queen is in the
mummy, sometimes goes walking.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.833
Don't worry.
Only rumor. Story.

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:01.875
The Queen Hetepheres is
the mother of the King Khufu.

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:05.458
And the pyramid was
discovered in the year 1925.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.292
Ibrahim, come on.

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:12.375
Now we will see the Queen sleeping
inside this for years and years.

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:13.958
Come down, Ibrahim.

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:18.333
See the mummy... Oh God!
Run!

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:21.333
Run!
The curse is back!

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.500
Run! The curse is back!

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:29.500
Run! The curse is back!

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:48.875
Has the professor arrived?-
- Yes, sir. Waiting in your room.

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.667
And the minister?-
- Yes, sir. He too.

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:52.708
Good.

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:55.250
First, the minister.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.875
Then, the professor.

00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:32.000
Long live the revolution!

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:45.792
Hello Professor!
Welcome to Egypt!

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:58.667
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:42.958
Sir...

00:08:44.042 --> 00:08:45.167
Hello sir...

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:47.375
Come sit.-
- Thank you.

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.292
Please keep sitting.

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:53.125
Sit, I'll get down soon.
Come.

00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:56.250
Get down whenever. I
promise I won't stop you.

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:58.917
Keep sitting till then.
I'm good.

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.000
How long will you
stand like that?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.500
Don't worry. Sit, these
seats are for you guys.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.667
You're making a mistake.

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.917
The seats are for handicapped
people, like you.

00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:10.792
Huh?-
- Yes.

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:14.542
Actually you are both
blind and deaf.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:17.417
Neither can you see
that I'm comfortable standing

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:20.542
nor can you hear that I'm
saying I don't want to sit.

00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:23.417
Thus, it is you who must
sit here because it's for

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:27.125
unfortunate people like you
that they've these privileges.

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.625
When are your
selection test results?

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:32.042
March.

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:35.208
Do something worthwhile
instead of sitting idle till then.

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:38.500
God knows when Raja gets a
case and then you both set out.

00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:41.000
Is it all true, what's
written in the books?

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:43.708
Or exaggerated for
the publisher?

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.750
They censor it, so you
don't get worried

00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:50.125
and keep me and even
Kakababu locked up at home.

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:51.250
Right!

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.958
His mother couldn't do it all
these years, nor could your father

00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.917
and I will lock him up at home?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.250
No, that's alright.

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:03.458
I was saying, don't sit idle
at home and waste time.

00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.833
Learn a foreign language,
learn computers.

00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:09.208
Can I learn Salsa?

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.292
What!

00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:11.333
Salsa.

00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:15.250
Latin American dance form.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.708
Great! My son will learn how
to dance now? What was that...

00:10:18.708 --> 00:10:19.750
Salsa!

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:23.292
Don't bother Dada. You
better concentrate on

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
your Hilsa.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.667
Having pickle with an empty
stomach leads to acidity.

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.875
Where's the car?
How did you come?

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:32.667
Still at the garage.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.500
Couldn't find a taxi. So...

00:10:36.292 --> 00:10:37.625
took a bus.

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:43.000
Chicken?-
- No.

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:46.958
How's the fish?-
- Nice.

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.833
<i>NRIs have started coming
back to the country from Cairo.</i>

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:52.667
<i>Egypt is up in arms for the
removal of the President.</i>

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:55.375
<i>Poverty, unemployment
and corruption has led</i>

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.625
<i>to demands for the
removal of the President.</i>

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:02.417
<i>Thousands of people protested
last Tuesday with this demand.</i>

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:05.625
<i>The Headquarters of the
National Democratic Party</i>

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:08.750
<i>was set on fire by the
protesters on Friday.</i>

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.917
<i>At least 45 people
died in the conflict.</i>

00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:12.708
Wonder why all this violence!

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.583
Wonder who helps them
in these activities!

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.417
<i>The minister's assembly
was declared to be annulled</i>

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:23.250
<i>but that hasn't doused the
fire of public protests at all.</i>

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.500
Why would I want
to impress girls?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.042
Can't the bike skid by itself?

00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:45.333
In any case, it wasn't
my mistake. No!

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:47.625
No!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.792
No, I can't apply
all that medicine.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:54.000
Anyway the patient is
alone once you leave.

00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:56.792
By the way, when are we leaving?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.708
Anyway, I'm home.
I better sneak in silently

00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:03.708
or Mom will give me a
proper scolding.

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.292
And if Dad's home
then I'm... anyway.

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:09.000
I'll give you a call
in some time.

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:12.125
Me too.

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:16.167
Then someone told me
that you know Hieroglyphics.

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:17.542
You are the man!

00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:21.375
I came all the way to
Kolkata looking for you.

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:24.083
So, that's the complete story.

00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:28.292
So hurry up and come down.
He gets started anytime.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.708
I get that
Mr. Mamun, but

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:36.750
now tell me, why
choose me for this?

00:12:37.208 --> 00:12:38.875
As far as I know

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:43.542
in the year 1820
Jean Francois Champollion had

00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:45.583
deciphered it completely.

00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:46.458
Yes.

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:48.708
And these days you'll
find at least

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:52.083
two to three Egyptologists
in every country.

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:54.458
Yes, that is correct but

00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:56.542
there are only very few people

00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.750
who can read it easily.

00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:03.292
Because this is the most
difficult part of Egyptology.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.042
And I've tried to contact
many many people.

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:08.417
You know Harold Petri,

00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:10.875
he tried for a long time.

00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:12.375
Nothing came of it.

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:15.583
Laura Eisenstein.
She tried. Nothing.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.667
Also Maqsood Alam.

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:18.917
But...

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.750
Then Huang Lee also.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.667
Zero.

00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:25.625
Only you are left.

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:29.125
You are our last hope
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:31.917
Can I offer you smoke?

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:33.917
Sorry, I quit.

00:13:34.208 --> 00:13:36.458
Oh. Then I should not
smoke also.

00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:39.125
What about Lord Pembroke?

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.333
Lord Pembroke... yes.
Dead. Gone. Finished.

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:45.875
Died in a car accident.

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:48.875
The Police says he was...

00:13:50.583 --> 00:13:51.500
killed.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.625
Mr. Mamun,

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.250
tell me honestly,

00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:01.583
what do you think,
after taking up this case

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.833
how long will I remain alive?

00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:06.625
What?

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.750
You joking?

00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:15.125
You joking!

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:17.292
With me!

00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:21.708
I thought... for a minute
I thought... what is he saying!

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:24.833
Good joke. But...

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:28.833
you will have to do something
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.917
I've come to you with
a lot of hope.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.833
<i>Welcome to the show on Fever FM.</i>

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:44.333
<i>Coming up now is a superhit
song from a 1958 film.</i>

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:48.958
<i>Keep listening and keep
sending in your requests.</i>

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:14.958
(song playing)

00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:48.625
Show me.

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.042
Where are you hurt?

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:53.625
As in?

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:58.583
I know it's not easy to walk
around normally with a limp.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.792
Have gone through a lot with this leg.
From Afghanistan to Arthrodesis!

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:05.125
Were you in a meeting
or spying on me?

00:16:05.125 --> 00:16:08.208
Why? Can't my senses work in
unision if I am not a detective?

00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:10.250
Who was that man, Kakababu?

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.417
Not 'was'. He still is.

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:16.542
A sweet maker. Came to teach
me a recipe. Give me your leg.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.542
Come on, show me.-
- It's nothing much.

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:21.583
I fell from the bike and
sprained my ankle.

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:24.083
A little turmeric will...

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.125
Oh my God!

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:32.583
You can learn about many different
remedies if you've stayed in the hills.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:36.500
Where sympathy works better
than Homeopathy or Allopathy.

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:39.708
It's still swollen but
the pain is nearly...-

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.042
It will recede.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.000
And if it doesn't

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:46.042
Apply this.

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:47.917
Okay.

00:16:48.458 --> 00:16:50.417
And listen,
Avinash da was saying,

00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.500
that Marwari businessman
who got killed in their locality,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.875
the Police is clueless.

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:56.667
So.. if you could...-

00:16:56.667 --> 00:17:00.083
Told you; not my job to catch
petty thieves and murderers.

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:03.167
Mr. Ray and Mr. Banerjee
have spoiled you guys.

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:05.042
Everyone has to grow up
to be a detective.

00:17:07.042 --> 00:17:08.375
So what do I tell him?

00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:12.042
Should I bunk the topic? As
in skirt the issue?

00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:14.792
No. Tell him
Kakababu said that

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:17.458
lizards and dinosaurs may
belong to the same family

00:17:17.833 --> 00:17:19.500
but they're not the same thing.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:27.542
(song playing)

00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:32.042
Matches?

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:40.500
(song playing)

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.208
Holy crap!

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.542
Can you imagine this!

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:08.958
Can't you drive properly!

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.542
Please tell me, who was he?-
- Told you,

00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:46.958
Thomas Alva Edison, was
teaching me how to make a bulb.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.125
You are such a...-

00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:53.375
- Stop sniffing out adventure
anywhere and everywhere.

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:57.208
Or you'll turn into a bomb
squad alsatian gradually.

00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.333
Enough of being a Tintin.
Now focus on

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.792
studies for some time.

00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:06.625
But there is no pressure
now. Holidays are on.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.833
And I did learn swimming,
Karate, as you suggested

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.333
and unravelled so many
mysteries worldwide with you.

00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:14.500
No more mysteries,
no more thrills.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.708
Tell yourself they're both on
vacation or are sitting home

00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:19.500
like me, with a VRS.

00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:26.625
Though I did find
a mystery which

00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:28.583
needs to be solved.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.375
Mystery!

00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.375
What is it? Please tell me!

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:35.833
Bermuda Triangle?
El dorado? Atlantis?

00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:37.875
Or is it...
oh, okay wait!

00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:41.750
UFO?

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:44.875
The same lad who'd not
wake up before 10 am

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:48.250
goes for early morning
walks these days.

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:53.625
The same lad who'd play football
in the mud all day

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:57.875
these days, takes
a bath in the evening,

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:02.708
empties half a bottle of perfume
and sets out chewing mints.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.792
Who's the girl?-
- Huh?

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:11.042
Who is the girl?

00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.583
Girl? Which girl?
Where did she come from?

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:17.833
I don't know any girl.
Yes Mom. Mom is calling.

00:20:18.458 --> 00:20:19.333
Wait.

00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:24.375
Focus on something constructive
if you don't have studies.

00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:27.625
What constructive?
I am doing...

00:20:28.083 --> 00:20:29.958
Karate.. and...-
- Listen.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.292
I'll be out of town for work.
Don't pester your parents.

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:36.958
Work! Work as in?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.208
Come on! Tell me,
what work?

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:43.750
Please tell me! At least tell
me where you're going.

00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:45.792
Come on tell me!

00:20:52.542 --> 00:21:01.583
(song playing)

00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:16.583
(Funeral procession)
Lord, bless the noble soul.

00:24:16.583 --> 00:24:19.250
Lord, bless the noble soul.

00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.917
Lord, bless the noble soul.

00:24:27.042 --> 00:24:29.083
Sad evening for
Professor Jha today.

00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:31.792
Who's he?-
- Warden at the Narmada Hostel.

00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:34.917
He too is from CHS.
I teach Ancient History.

00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:35.875
He teaches Modern.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.083
These boys are from the
Narmada Hostel.

00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:40.458
The TV has not been
working for many days.

00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:44.875
There were complaints
but the TV wasn't replaced.

00:24:45.583 --> 00:24:47.542
Now they're parading
to Mr. Jha.

00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:49.417
The madness has
remained intact, isn't it?

00:24:49.417 --> 00:24:50.333
Absolutely.

00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:52.667
But Raja da,

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.042
now tell me,

00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.000
why put up at JNU of all places?

00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:59.833
As in you've worked at the
Archeological Survey for so long.

00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:01.500
You could've stayed anywhere.

00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:06.917
That I could. But I need to
reaffirm certain things from you.

00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:08.583
Reaffirm?

00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:10.583
From me?

00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:14.583
I can't fathom this double
meaning language you use.

00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:16.083
Not double.
Only one language.

00:25:16.292 --> 00:25:18.167
Tell me if I remember correctly.

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:20.375
Which language?

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.958
Egyptian Hieroglyphics.

00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:24.458
What!

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.500
Sit... Sit.

00:25:46.833 --> 00:25:47.833
Yes.

00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:49.750
Had your tea and snacks?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.417
See, I gave you some work
and you could not do it.

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:56.917
So if I shoot you

00:25:58.625 --> 00:25:59.875
right now

00:26:01.292 --> 00:26:04.083
will I be doing anything wrong?

00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:10.833
Why are you sitting like
a statue?

00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:12.958
Forgive us, won't happen again.

00:26:12.958 --> 00:26:15.208
There is no 'again' anymore.

00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:18.375
That can happen only if
you live any longer.

00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:21.292
It was a close shave.

00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:26.958
It is a close shave
for you, son.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:30.833
I didn't take up arms
to kill rats like you.

00:26:31.917 --> 00:26:34.083
Give me another chance..-
- Are you crazy?

00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:37.417
Gave you a simple
assignment. You failed!

00:26:38.042 --> 00:26:40.208
How on earth will you
do a tougher job?

00:26:46.708 --> 00:26:47.917
Get Hossem for me.

00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:51.542
He is my man.
He'll do it.

00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:57.625
I learnt this magic in Peru.

00:26:58.292 --> 00:27:01.542
I was sitting at Machu Pichu, all of
a sudden, an old man appears.

00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:04.292
Looked like an actual Inca.

00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.333
He kept explaining to
me in his own language.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:09.125
And I could not understand a thing.
 And so on, when...

00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:11.917
Oh God! Will you
show the magic trick!

00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:16.500
Snigdha, in this entire
to and fro between countries,

00:27:17.042 --> 00:27:19.167
Rini's education does not
get affected?

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:22.250
Not really. Besides, Rini
is used to it now.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.833
Now choose one of these.

00:27:25.292 --> 00:27:26.792
Come on. Take one out.

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:28.708
Oh, you'll take
that one? Sure.

00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:33.167
She's been living with us since
our parents passed away and

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:36.333
she's studied in an international
school so there's a parity.

00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:39.417
There's a standardized-
- Now I'm shuffling it.

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:43.125
So, she doesn't stick
out in a crowd.

00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:45.458
Here! This is your card.

00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:49.625
Heard a lot from Shantu's
sister about you and Sidhharth.

00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:53.042
Hope you've had a good
stay in Kolkata so far.

00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:56.083
So, the previous card,
here, this one...

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:58.625
Why is the edge folded?

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.625
And why did you shuffle
only from the top?

00:28:05.792 --> 00:28:06.708
So you got it?

00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:09.875
See, he found me out!

00:28:10.417 --> 00:28:11.417
Smart boy!

00:28:13.042 --> 00:28:15.750
Fact is, how will a magic
from Peru work in Kolkata?

00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:19.750
Magic is quite an art
if you don't get caught.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.125
What's going on downstairs?
Did we miss something?

00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:24.542
Come let's see.-
- Let's go.

00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:25.833
Very funny.

00:28:26.417 --> 00:28:29.417
If you get the chance to examine
a magician closely after every trick

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.542
then anyone can get it.
No big deal.

00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:35.042
That's a valid point.

00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:38.083
Did I say it's a big deal?-
- She's joking.

00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:41.500
Not now. But you may
blow your own trumpet later.

00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:45.083
The way you boasted about
your adventures the other day...

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.625
Which day?

00:28:46.917 --> 00:28:47.750
Which day?

00:28:48.958 --> 00:28:49.917
Which day?

00:28:59.792 --> 00:29:03.583
Err... what's on
menu for tonight?

00:29:04.083 --> 00:29:05.250
A goat?

00:30:46.083 --> 00:30:47.583
Look behind you bloody fool!

00:32:15.917 --> 00:32:17.583
Let's go, dinner is ready.

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:21.333
Sorry.-
- Don't worry.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.917
Mom will calm down
after a few days of grumbling.

00:32:26.042 --> 00:32:29.125
I don't think so. I think she
is extremely mad at you

00:32:30.167 --> 00:32:31.125
and me.

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:33.750
Oh God! Told
you I'll manage.

00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:36.625
See, first I'll convince Dad.

00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:39.250
And then I'll...-
- What if they don't agree?

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:42.417
Why won't they? This is
2010, Rini.

00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:45.500
She's a bit worried
about my career. That's all.

00:32:45.792 --> 00:32:49.167
And then you're an year elder
to me so... that's a bit of a

00:32:49.792 --> 00:32:50.958
you know.

00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:55.083
I hope you realise that this
is not a holiday fling.

00:32:57.333 --> 00:32:58.958
Or a high school crush.

00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:03.458
Or is it?

00:33:44.417 --> 00:33:45.417
Kakababu.

00:33:48.458 --> 00:33:49.750
Yes, hello.

00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:51.875
Hello.

00:33:52.792 --> 00:33:54.292
How are you guys doing?

00:33:55.292 --> 00:33:56.458
How are your parents?

00:33:57.042 --> 00:33:58.625
<i>Everyone's good. And you?</i>

00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:00.667
Why does your voice sound weird?

00:34:01.292 --> 00:34:04.000
Got fever after coming here.


00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.500
<i>Work is not progressing.</i>

00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:07.625
<i>Not bringing you along
</i>

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:09.125
was a mistake.

00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:13.000
Tell your Dad and come
to Delhi tomorrow.

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:15.792
<i>A ticket will be kept for
you at the Kolkata airport.</i>

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.667
And a man will recieve you
at the Delhi airport.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.917
Will you manage?
No problem right?

00:34:23.625 --> 00:34:26.958
Got to Mount Everest
and the African jungles...

00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:29.417
this is only Delhi.. as in...-

00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:31.625
<i>Good. And listen,</i>

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:34.625
carry your passport.

00:34:35.042 --> 00:34:36.000
Passport!

00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:39.208
Where are we going?
Tell me please!

00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:40.708
Who was that man?

00:34:41.042 --> 00:34:42.083
 Film maker Subhash Ghai.

00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:46.458
He's giving me a break.
Goodnight.

00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:49.708
Come, let's go.

00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:53.500
Couldn't you call
from the ambulance?

00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:56.625
Hey Sukhwinder, get
the stretcher man!

00:34:56.833 --> 00:35:00.750
He'd get it if I called from
ambulance. Very intelligent boy.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.458
He'd worry for no reason.-
- Anyone will worry Raja.

00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:05.708
The bullet brushed
past your ribs.

00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:07.792
It's a bullet's wound
for God's sake!

00:35:07.792 --> 00:35:09.125
I've been seeing this
for years now

00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:13.042
it's easier to crack our CBI
cases than to argue with you.

00:35:13.042 --> 00:35:15.042
You talk a lot. Come on.

00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:18.333
One minute.-
- What now?

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.875
When did this happen?

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.333
A few days ago, sir.

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.083
God knows when he woke up.

00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:51.167
I woke up to see him
walk towards the other room.

00:35:52.042 --> 00:35:55.083
I went in and saw,
Baba Peer is sitting there.

00:35:56.125 --> 00:35:58.917
Sketching the same pictures.

00:36:00.792 --> 00:36:01.792
Okay.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:08.333
Tell his disciples that the
gathering will be off for a few days.

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.167
Tell them...

00:36:11.042 --> 00:36:13.958
he isn't well.-
- As you say, sir.

00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:17.875
Hafiz.

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:18.667
Yes, sir.

00:36:20.458 --> 00:36:22.125
Inform Ibrahim in Kolkata,

00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:24.500
Mr. Roy Choudhury's
nephew's coming today.

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:29.708
There is no problem here.
Follow him, protect him there.

00:36:30.292 --> 00:36:34.208
Nothing should happen to
that boy. Not even a scratch

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:35.917
until he's on the flight.

00:36:38.292 --> 00:36:42.583
That Son of the Devil
planned the attack last night.

00:36:42.583 --> 00:36:45.250
He may do anything, any moment.

00:36:45.917 --> 00:36:47.500
Got it?-
- Yes, sir.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.167
Go.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.792
You won't get through.

00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:31.750
Kakababu's phone is
switched off.

00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:33.750
Routine check up
at the nursing home.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.875
As in?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.333
Kakababu sent a car.
Come, let's leave fast.

00:37:39.333 --> 00:37:42.750
But why the nursing home?
What's wrong?

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.833
Shall we?

00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:48.208
(song playing)

00:39:09.542 --> 00:39:10.750
You?

00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:16.042
I assigned you the job.
You took it. You came here.

00:39:16.875 --> 00:39:18.833
So you are my responsibility.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.583
But

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:22.125
this thing what happened...

00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:26.042
very unfortunate.
And I am sorry.

00:39:26.542 --> 00:39:29.167
You must punish me.
Please.

00:39:30.083 --> 00:39:33.917
He who's been punished with this
handicap, how can he punish you?

00:39:34.417 --> 00:39:38.125
Mr. Mamun, why don't you get it,
I'm not anyone's responsibility,

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:39.458
or anyone's

00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:40.250
slave.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.750
You invited me here, thank you.

00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:47.583
While I'm on this job if my
life's in danger then it's my..

00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:49.708
- No Mr. Roy Choudhury.

00:39:50.375 --> 00:39:52.375
That is your greatness.

00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:55.958
Mr. Mamun, this could be an
old enemy of mine who has no...

00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:58.208
- Yes, that is correct. But
I feel bad you know.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.792
I feel responsible.-
- Oh forget it, Mr. Mamun.

00:40:01.417 --> 00:40:04.167
Tell me, has your uncle
sketched any new pictures?

00:40:05.292 --> 00:40:06.292
Yes.

00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:10.125
He sketched a few some days ago.

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.583
I'd like to show you but...

00:40:13.042 --> 00:40:16.458
your condition is...-
- Oh don't worry. I'm good.

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.292
I want to see those pictures.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.292
Okay, sure. I will bring
them here for you.

00:40:22.667 --> 00:40:23.542
Tomorrow.

00:40:27.417 --> 00:40:28.833
But what do you think?

00:40:30.417 --> 00:40:32.417
What is he trying to say

00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:34.625
through these pictures?

00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:39.417
Don't know.

00:40:42.042 --> 00:40:43.750
I've understood parts of it.

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.458
But to get the entire story

00:40:48.083 --> 00:40:50.083
Mohammad must go
to the mountain.

00:41:03.375 --> 00:41:05.625
What happened?
Got scared?

00:41:06.667 --> 00:41:08.667
Not at all.
Why get scared?

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:12.250
Heard the TV and... got
a bit puzzled you know.

00:41:12.708 --> 00:41:14.125
Puzzled? As in?

00:41:15.208 --> 00:41:17.125
As in I got confused.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.292
Actually, I feel I'm a
part of a spy thriller.

00:41:21.208 --> 00:41:23.833
Strangers are escorting me
from one place to another.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.042
So...

00:41:25.042 --> 00:41:27.917
Not sure of the 'spy' bit.
But thriller definitely.

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:31.083
After what happened to Raja...-
- Why?

00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:34.500
Fever is a common thing.
What's thrilling about it?

00:41:36.333 --> 00:41:38.875
Oh yes. That's what
Raja told you. Right.

00:41:40.083 --> 00:41:41.042
Told me, as in?

00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:42.792
What happened to Kakababu?

00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:47.708
Why're you getting angry? Didn't
inform because you'd worry.

00:41:47.917 --> 00:41:51.750
And getting worked up is a bad thing.
We need to keep our cool, right?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.417
Nothing has happened to
me. I am fit and fine.

00:41:54.417 --> 00:41:57.208
The bullet brushed past
my ribs. So, a small injury.

00:41:57.708 --> 00:42:01.542
Let's introduce you. Stop frowning.
He is anyway very embarrassed.

00:42:01.792 --> 00:42:04.708
He thinks he is
responsible for this.

00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:10.167
Let me introduce you to my nephew,
Mr. Mamun. Very brave lad.

00:42:10.167 --> 00:42:13.000
He accompanies me to many
places as my assistant.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Hello my friend.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:18.458
And he, Mr. Al Mamun,
a very famous businessman.

00:42:18.458 --> 00:42:22.167
He was based in Delhi in India
for a long time for his business.

00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:25.708
Though he was born
and brought up in Egypt.

00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:28.542
What?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.708
Err... no, nothing.

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:34.417
Hello.-
- Hello.

00:42:36.083 --> 00:42:38.875
Excuse me now.
I'll let you know.

00:42:39.417 --> 00:42:40.625
Soon.-
- Thank you.

00:42:40.917 --> 00:42:42.500
See you.-
- See you.

00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:44.000
Bright boy huh!

00:42:46.917 --> 00:42:49.792
Raja, you better explain
things to Shantu.

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:52.417
Or the boy will
die of curiosity.

00:42:52.542 --> 00:42:54.125
You go ahead.

00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:57.375
Okay, so... let me
do the honors. Huh?

00:42:58.167 --> 00:42:59.333
Shantu,

00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:03.250
to understand this
case you must first

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.375
understand the concept
of Hieroglyphics.

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.000
Hieroglyphics is...-
- Yes.

00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:11.417
An ancient Egyptian language
that uses pictures to communicate.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.167
I know. Go on.-
- Holy Christ!

00:43:14.958 --> 00:43:18.958
Watching The History Channel
instead of studying.

00:43:19.458 --> 00:43:20.958
Continue Naren.-
- Yes.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.375
So this Mr. Al Mamun...-
- One second.

00:43:23.375 --> 00:43:25.750
Sorry to interrupt
you. Let me guess?

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:28.833
This Mr. Al Mamun has found
something written in Hieroglyphics

00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:32.708
which he wants Kakababu
to decipher, right?

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.458
Raja, it's obvious
he's your nephew.

00:43:36.792 --> 00:43:39.292
Leave it Naren. I'll
take it from here.

00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:44.083
Mufti Mohammad is a
distant uncle of Al Mamun.

00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:48.333
From Egypt. About
hundred years of age.

00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:52.542
A spiritual man. Doesn't
speak. Only signals.

00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:56.500
Has numerous disciples
in numerous countries.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.542
Because of his deteriorating health,
Al Mamun brought him to Delhi,

00:44:00.917 --> 00:44:02.125
for his treatment.

00:44:02.875 --> 00:44:07.792
After coming here, one
night he woke up

00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:09.792
and started sketching
those pictures.

00:44:10.667 --> 00:44:12.708
In fact even now he often

00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:14.750
sketches those pictures.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.292
Al Mamun figured the
moment he saw it

00:44:17.292 --> 00:44:19.833
that it was some sort of
a message in Hieroglyphics.

00:44:20.417 --> 00:44:26.292
He even thought these could be some
commandments for his disciples or

00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:27.708
his will.

00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:31.750
Tell me something Raja,
though this language is extinct

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.333
there are so many historians.
No one can read it?

00:44:34.958 --> 00:44:39.875
They can. In fact Al Mamun did go to
many of them but no one could help.

00:44:40.375 --> 00:44:44.625
Actually this language can be
interpreted and written in many ways,

00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:46.167
much like a riddle.

00:44:46.542 --> 00:44:48.542
So you told him the meaning?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.208
No. Though there was
an offer of 20 lakhs.

00:44:52.667 --> 00:44:55.500
Huh! Why?-
- Two reasons.

00:44:55.792 --> 00:44:58.292
One, the writing is
incomplete, there's more.

00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:01.833
Two, these aren't his
teachings or his will.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.708
A request made 80 years ago
because of a certain situation.

00:45:06.917 --> 00:45:07.958
A request?

00:45:09.583 --> 00:45:11.208
To whoever understands it.

00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:14.125
Let's say, to me.-
- What are you saying!

00:45:14.583 --> 00:45:17.167
Can't make head or tail
out of what you're saying.

00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:24.500
Hello.

00:45:25.417 --> 00:45:26.500
Yes, tell me.

00:45:30.708 --> 00:45:31.667
What!

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:33.167
Really?

00:45:33.792 --> 00:45:36.000
Of course, sure.
We're coming right away.

00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:38.458
Yes.
 Okay, bye.

00:45:39.792 --> 00:45:41.375
Hey Raja, what nonsense!

00:45:41.583 --> 00:45:44.208
- Hey! 
- What on earth
are you doing!

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:47.500
Mr. Mamun called.-
- Are you mad!

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.833
Mufti Mohammad has
started sketching again.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.583
We can see him sketch
if we leave right now.

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.667
I'll change and come.
Wait, we'll go together.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:58.250
But Kakababu, how
can you go like this?

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.875
What is the problem?

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.667
Anyway the hospital
will spare me in two days.

00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:07.208
But if I don't reach on time,
will history spare me?

00:46:09.708 --> 00:46:11.542
So late! So late!

00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:12.958
You are very late!

00:46:13.167 --> 00:46:16.750
Sorry.-
- Baba Peer stopped writing.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.583
I came back you know,
from the nursing home,

00:46:21.042 --> 00:46:23.667
I rushed to his room

00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:27.208
but he had stopped sketching.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.083
He is just sitting there.

00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:34.833
I don't know what to do.

00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:36.333
This way. Please come.

00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:40.500
Whatever, I want
to speak to him.

00:46:41.417 --> 00:46:44.417
He is trying to tell us
something through the pictures.

00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:48.375
How will you speak to him?
He hasn't spoken for years.

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:50.292
He will.

00:46:51.167 --> 00:46:55.500
He sure will. I've brought his
language along with me.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.333
What!

00:46:57.583 --> 00:46:58.708
What are you saying?

00:47:13.125 --> 00:47:17.750
Don't mind please. You both
stay here. We both go in.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.250
But we...-
- Alright. You guys wait here.

00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:23.375
Let's go in.-
- Thank you. Come.

00:47:31.292 --> 00:47:32.750
Respected Master

00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:40.958
we have a guest from India who
wants to meet you and talk to you.

00:47:54.667 --> 00:47:55.458
Hello.

00:50:15.417 --> 00:50:16.750
Hafiz! Hafiz!

00:50:23.792 --> 00:50:27.125
- Call the doctor right now!
- Yes.

00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:28.167
Are you okay?

00:50:30.458 --> 00:50:32.042
Hello doctor, come fast.
Baba's not well.

00:50:32.042 --> 00:50:36.125
Baba, how are you
feeling? Baba!

00:50:36.125 --> 00:50:37.708
Do you feel alright?

00:50:39.458 --> 00:50:40.458
Take him.

00:50:44.042 --> 00:50:46.083
The doctor's on his way.-
- Come.

00:50:47.708 --> 00:50:50.917
We must let him rest.-
- What's wrong?

00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:55.542
Okay, don't worry.
It's okay now.

00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:58.875
So, Mr. Roy Choudhury...

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.250
could you understand what
Baba Peer is trying to say?

00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:06.875
Yes.-
- What is it?

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.667
Sadly I can't tell you.

00:51:10.792 --> 00:51:14.875
Baba Peer's wish is that before the
world gets to know about this secret

00:51:15.042 --> 00:51:18.208
I investigate this matter
myself.

00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:23.125
All I can tell you is, this is
probably Baba Peer's last will.

00:51:23.542 --> 00:51:27.542
But he neither mentioned money
nor anything for his disciples.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.458
So I am so sorry, I really
can't accept your kind offer.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.917
Baba Pir gave you
the responsibility?

00:51:36.417 --> 00:51:37.333
Yes.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.583
And you won't tell me
what the responsibility is?

00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:43.833
You'll investigate it
yourself, sitting in Kolkata?

00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:44.958
No.

00:51:45.292 --> 00:51:46.792
I'll investigate in Egypt.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:48.875
What!

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.458
You'll go to Egypt?

00:51:58.333 --> 00:52:00.792
If this is Baba Peer's wish,
then

00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:02.958
What can I say?

00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:09.792
You took the trouble of coming
here, you helped me, thanks a lot.

00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:13.917
If you need any help
in Egypt, then

00:52:14.792 --> 00:52:18.292
give me a call. I'm going
to Egypt next month.

00:52:18.875 --> 00:52:20.667
Maybe we will meet.

00:52:21.875 --> 00:52:22.667
Goodbye.

00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:24.042
Goodbye.

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:25.458
Come.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:48.208
Quite a few of these shops are
new. They weren't there earlier.

00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:52.583
But Bhombol's Salon
is still there.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.917
Do you get Chinese here?-
- Yes, anything you want.

00:52:57.292 --> 00:52:59.875
The Lamb dry and Fu-young
are very famous here.

00:53:01.667 --> 00:53:04.042
Naren, have some.-
- I've tried it.

00:53:07.875 --> 00:53:08.917
Quite tasty.

00:53:10.292 --> 00:53:13.500
The sweetmeat is pretty good.-
- Have some, Shantu?

00:53:23.792 --> 00:53:26.833
Everything is
the same, isn't it?

00:53:26.833 --> 00:53:27.792
Sorry.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.958
I've to go back now. I
have a seminar tomorrow.

00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:37.500
Okay, see you.

00:53:37.542 --> 00:53:40.250
Sure. I'll show them
around the JNU campus.

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:43.042
I think going to Egypt is a
very stupid thing to do.

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:44.458
Amazing place.

00:53:44.958 --> 00:53:47.500
The university is located right in
the middle of Aravalli mountains.

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:52.750
Within jungles, caves and ravines
stands this academic complex

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:53.833
and this hostel.

00:53:54.417 --> 00:53:55.875
Raja, I'm serious.

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:57.833
At least we can discuss this?

00:53:57.833 --> 00:54:01.125
Sure. But you can't discuss it
anywhere and everywhere.

00:54:01.542 --> 00:54:05.125
It's a very dramatic discussion.
We need a proper stage.

00:54:06.542 --> 00:54:08.750
Shantu, your uncle is nuts.

00:54:09.167 --> 00:54:12.208
Stage, as in?-
- A stage amidst the wilderness!

00:54:15.458 --> 00:54:19.042
The place is very romantic, isn't it?-
- Yes, I was thinking...

00:54:19.875 --> 00:54:25.167
Shantu, the Egyptian Mystery is
clouding our other mystery.

00:54:25.167 --> 00:54:28.250
In fact, the other one
is a little complicated.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.333
What other mystery?

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:32.625
Not mystery.

00:54:34.083 --> 00:54:35.083
Mystery woman.

00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:48.458
Gentlemen...

00:54:49.708 --> 00:54:50.833
presenting...

00:54:51.583 --> 00:54:53.083
P.S.R.

00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:54.625
P.S.R?

00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:56.833
Partha Sarathi Rocks.

00:54:57.458 --> 00:54:59.500
See those rocks?-
- Huh?

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:00.792
Over there.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.792
Delhi's highest natural point.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:06.042
Named after the first VC of JNU.

00:55:08.333 --> 00:55:10.542
And finally, gentlemen...

00:55:11.583 --> 00:55:14.708
this is O.A.T.

00:55:15.958 --> 00:55:17.542
And as the bard wrote,

00:55:18.167 --> 00:55:19.917
"All the world's a stage

00:55:20.667 --> 00:55:22.833
And all the men and
women merely players".

00:55:25.292 --> 00:55:27.792
Okay, let's talk now?

00:55:28.042 --> 00:55:30.042
Yes. Sure. Tell me.

00:55:30.292 --> 00:55:32.583
Raja, I have had a word
with the embassy.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:34.542
With the Interpol too.

00:55:35.458 --> 00:55:39.792
Not only as a friend, I'm warning
you as a senior officer of the CBI,

00:55:39.875 --> 00:55:42.625
going to Egypt
is a very bad idea.

00:55:43.833 --> 00:55:47.875
For a start, the political condition
in Egypt isn't very good right now.

00:55:48.083 --> 00:55:51.708
Moreover, you and Al Mamun, both
have been attacked twice already

00:55:51.917 --> 00:55:53.208
in your own country.

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:56.458
If something happens abroad,
who will be responsible?

00:55:56.958 --> 00:56:00.625
This affair has become more delicate
after Mufti Mohammad's death.

00:56:01.042 --> 00:56:02.625
Two groups
amongst his disciples.

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.167
One led by Al Mamun.

00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:06.583
The other group's leader
is Hani Alkadi.

00:56:07.083 --> 00:56:09.792
We have information, Hani Alkadi
made those attacks on you.

00:56:10.917 --> 00:56:13.583
Nice. Such a sweet
name. Hani Alkadi.

00:56:14.167 --> 00:56:17.000
So this Hani Alkadi is
harmful you say?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.542
Not sweet like his name?-
- Don't joke Raja.

00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:22.542
Hani Alkadi is a very
cruel and cunning man.

00:56:23.708 --> 00:56:26.875
Studied in Europe. Very
knowledgeable. Knows 17 languages.

00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:29.833
Trained in hand to hand combat
and long distance shooting.

00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:31.042
Master of disguise.

00:56:31.208 --> 00:56:32.875
He is the biggest reason behind

00:56:33.125 --> 00:56:35.667
this growing underground
movement in Egypt.

00:56:36.042 --> 00:56:39.167
Hani Alkadi thinks
Al Mamun had hired you

00:56:39.167 --> 00:56:41.375
to decipher the meaning of
Mufti Mohammad's will.

00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:43.583
Now that you've figured
it out, you're double crossing

00:56:43.583 --> 00:56:45.167
and going to Egypt to
get it yourself.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.167
So, before anything
happens he will fetch

00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:49.167
the meaning of those
pictures from you.

00:56:50.333 --> 00:56:51.917
Wow. Quite nice.

00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:54.333
Then we can play
Pictionary together.

00:56:54.542 --> 00:56:58.000
Hey Raja, Indian Government
can't take this risk. I spoke to them.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.125
I'm not going on government's
behalf. I'm going on my own.

00:57:02.083 --> 00:57:04.667
What nonsense!-
- Thanks for the visa though.

00:57:05.292 --> 00:57:09.125
Please tell him!-
- What will Shantu say?

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:13.042
First let him read out the
message from Hani Alkadi.

00:57:14.042 --> 00:57:16.625
Let's see what my sweet
villain has to say.

00:57:17.833 --> 00:57:20.917
Message? What message?
I did not get any...-

00:57:21.958 --> 00:57:23.958
Check your brain first
and then your pocket.

00:57:25.792 --> 00:57:26.792
Found it?

00:57:29.375 --> 00:57:31.167
Yes. A chit.

00:57:31.833 --> 00:57:33.708
But how did it...-

00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:35.583
Remember bumping
into someone at KC?

00:57:35.708 --> 00:57:37.750
- That building there?
- Yes.

00:57:38.958 --> 00:57:40.083
Sorry.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.208
See what he writes.
Read it.

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.625
"One who breaks the
King's slumber

00:57:49.625 --> 00:57:53.083
death, as fast as the
wind shall befall him."

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.083
The mummy's curse engraved
on the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:02.875
You know Shantu, those who
discovered Tutankhamun's tomb

00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:06.833
many of them died
a mysterious death.

00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:09.125
So

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.417
Is this a warning?

00:58:10.917 --> 00:58:14.708
Well, not a mock test
suggestion paper certainly.

00:58:16.042 --> 00:58:17.792
But not a warning.

00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:19.333
A challenge.

00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:24.250
Fine. Let's see who death befalls
when the King's slumber breaks.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.708
Egypt... here we come!-
- Yes!

00:58:27.708 --> 00:58:30.500
No, but I was saying...-
- Don't look directly,

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.125
try to see from the
corner of your eye.

00:58:32.125 --> 00:58:35.000
That man in KC, remember
the colour he was wearing?

00:58:35.958 --> 00:58:37.042
Who? Where?

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.042
Alkadi's man. On the
top of P.S.R.

00:58:41.833 --> 00:58:45.417
Shadowing us. Checking if
we take up the challenge or not.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:48.042
(song playing)

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:14.500
Oh no! This must've been Naren.
He must've informed the embassy.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.042
- Did you know Sidhharth is posted here?
- Yes... no, I mean...

01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:20.875
- Didn't know he'd come to receive us.
- Oh, got it.

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:23.333
Welcome!
Welcome to Egypt.

01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:25.708
Met you after so long.

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.792
- How are you all?
- All good.

01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:31.417
We last met during the Kanishka episode.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.542
Come let's go home.

01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:36.083
Jumbo Prawns in coconut
milk, Steamed Bhetki, Chutni,

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:38.917
all that you love...-
- How thoughtful of you but

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:44.208
we've a booking. We'll
go to the hotel. Though,

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:47.250
Shantu may want to...-
- No! Why? No...

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.875
Fine! Have dinner with us.
I'll pick you up in the evening.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:52.208
Which hotel?-
- Harmoheb.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.542
I'll pick you up from Harmoheb.

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:56.042
Err... in that case I don't
mind falling for the trap

01:01:56.042 --> 01:02:00.667
Snigdha has set with
those Jumbo prawns!

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:04.958
So Shantu,
this is the country of

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:08.083
the pyramid of Khufu, once
world's tallest building.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:11.500
This is the country of Sphinx,
half man half lion!

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:15.000
This is the country seeing who's
Queen, Julius Caeser said,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.875
Let me help you.-
- Oh don't bother, continue

01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:20.417
with your Cleopatra
instead of all this.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:21.708
How are you?

01:02:21.917 --> 01:02:29.958
(song playing)

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.667
Won't you take a bath?

01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:45.750
Believe in ghosts?

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:49.833
Ghosts! Spirits.

01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:55.250
Err... may be I do, haven't
decided yet, why do you ask?

01:03:56.042 --> 01:04:00.375
Quite a few years ago I had come to
Egypt on a government assignment.

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:03.833
In fact that was when I began
studying about Hieroglyphics.

01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:06.083
Had heard an interesting
story back then.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:08.583
Crossed my mind on our
way from the airport.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:11.625
Hey! I am postponing
the bath.

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:13.792
What story?

01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:17.625
King Khufu, after whom
the pyramid is named,

01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:21.542
his mother, Queen Hetepheres'
tomb was discovered by

01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:23.500
a man named George Resner.

01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:26.708
He found many valuable
things there like

01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:31.333
golden beds, jewelry,
etc. The usual stuff.

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:34.083
But what he did not find was,

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:35.750
So...

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.958
Mr. Histroy Channel Addict,

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.875
what is that ornate box called
in which the mummy is kept?

01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:44.333
Err...

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.708
Oh God! I know it,
I nearly have it...

01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:54.167
Will the knowledge help
if you nearly have it?

01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:56.667
Sacrophagus! Yes!

01:04:56.875 --> 01:04:58.458
Close, sarcophagus.-
- Yes.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:02.750
Anyway, Resner discovered that the
sarcophagus of Hetepheres was empty.

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.333
No mummy!

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:10.750
Why would a thief steal a
corpse instead of the jewellery?

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:11.875
Correct.

01:05:12.333 --> 01:05:16.458
But the horror story begins here,
so far it was a detective story.

01:05:18.417 --> 01:05:21.583
After 3 months some archeologists
went to the same place

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:24.083
and found that the Queen's
mummy was right where it should be.

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:26.750
Strange!-
- The story is not over yet.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.500
After that a tourist guide went
there with some tourists and found

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:34.250
the sarcophagus to be empty!

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.667
Naturally, they were all...-
- Hubba!

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:39.083
What?-
- Huh..

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:42.208
No. Nothing. Just like that.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.708
Your weird language to
add to Hieroglyphics!

01:05:46.667 --> 01:05:50.667
Anyway, this continued for long.

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:53.083
And according to folklore,

01:05:53.167 --> 01:05:59.000
the mummified Queen Hetepheres
goes out for walks even today.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:02.167
So going out at night
in search of adventure,

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:04.125
will still be out of syllabus.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:05.583
My story is over.

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:09.708
Now go take a bath or no mystery
woman will come close to you.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:28.292
'Hubba'.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.875
Mad! This is mad!
You're mad!

01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:32.250
This is insane!

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.167
This Hani Alkadi is trying to
pressurise the Indian Government.

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:39.875
Just to get hold of you and
you come from India all the way

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:40.875
dancing yourself!

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.667
Manto, as far as
dancing is concerned

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:46.750
I don't even have two
left feet, I've only one.

01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:52.083
And as for Hani Alkadi,
don't worry, I'll manage.

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:54.500
No, I'll...-
- Anyway.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.125
We've met after so long,
let's chat up a bit.

01:06:57.292 --> 01:06:59.458
Okay now tell me one thing,

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:05.125
Queen Hetepheres' belongings,
as in the bed, ornaments etc.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.792
They're at the
Cairo museum right?

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:08.583
I was talking to my
nephew, Shantu,

01:07:08.583 --> 01:07:10.792
I really wanted to take him
to the museum and

01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:15.667
and here he is, meet my
nephew cum assistant, Shantu.

01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:19.042
And he's the curator of Cairo
museum, Sadat Manto.

01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:20.500
My old friend.-
- Nice to meet you.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.292
Hi sir.

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:25.958
He just told me some interesting
stories about Mufti Mohammad.

01:07:26.708 --> 01:07:30.333
Did not know how to read or
write. Began as a tourist guide.

01:07:30.917 --> 01:07:33.667
Then he became a revolutionary
leader against King Farouk.

01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:36.125
And after that turned into a
spiritual seeker towards the end.

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.792
Leaving out the tourist guide
bit, the rest is exactly

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:39.917
our Rishi Arabinda.

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.417
So, as I was saying
Mr. Manto,

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:46.042
Mufti Mohammad made no mention
of money, as you said. 

01:07:46.042 --> 01:07:50.542
He was a self-proclaimed fakir.
But he had one last wish

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.292
or will if you so call it.

01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:55.958
He wanted me to verify something
because of which I'm here.

01:07:57.583 --> 01:07:59.583
But there has to be
lot of money.

01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:03.750
Mufti Mohammad, when
he was a rebel leader,

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:07.458
he had lots of arms,
ammunitions, lots of money

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.792
that funded the revolution.
Now if he has a will,

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.958
- I guess the lunch has arrived.
- Yes.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:16.417
So, Manto.

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.333
Will you have lunch with us?-
- Yes, sure, why not!

01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:22.042
Fine, why not.-
- So... what I mean to say...

01:08:30.292 --> 01:08:31.333
Professor.

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:34.167
You come. We go.

01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:36.583
Now!

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.417
Shantu,

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:53.708
how can such a learned villain
have such an uneducated side-kick?

01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:56.375
What you say?-
- Nothing.

01:08:57.292 --> 01:09:00.750
I say, I not professor, you
come at complete wrong place.

01:09:01.208 --> 01:09:03.458
No! No wrong. Right!

01:09:04.083 --> 01:09:07.500
I see your photograph.
Now you come, we go.

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:10.292
Oh no! Told you I not go.

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:13.167
Because I not take
orders. Tell Alkadi

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:16.833
to come direct to here,
we do face to face meeting.

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:19.958
What say Shantu? Teach him
some Bengali too, should I?

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:22.125
Get going, you son of
a lame woman!

01:09:23.042 --> 01:09:26.833
(song playing)

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:41.042
BAM!

01:09:45.708 --> 01:09:49.042
WHAM!

01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:57.208
POW!

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.875
If you want to kill me
be my guest.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.500
But never talk to me like
that. I hate bad manners.

01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:21.708
My God!

01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:25.500
I not kill you.
He want you alive.

01:10:26.917 --> 01:10:28.750
But I kill boy.
I kill man

01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:30.750
if you not come.

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:34.750
Oh God! Why
drag me into this?

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:37.125
I am... innocent.-
- Okay.

01:10:38.042 --> 01:10:40.583
I go. But Hani Alkadi
should come.

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:43.208
I guest. Not he.

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:55.583
Don't worry. Just ask Sidhharth
to inform the Indian embassy.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:58.625
And listen, stay in the room.

01:10:59.042 --> 01:11:03.083
Don't go seeking adventure
to impress your Cleopatra.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.750
How does Cleopatra
come into all this?

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:08.958
The way your face lit up at
the mention of Egypt, why me,

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:10.708
anyone would understand.

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:13.167
Let's see if your mother
is okay with this.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.917
So Mr. Vidyasagar,
let's go.

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:23.000
Uno momento?

01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:06.208
(song playing)

01:12:40.167 --> 01:12:43.417
You wait here. He go to town.
He come back soon.

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:46.542
Don't try to run.
Desert all around.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.417
Your crutch no help.-
- I know son.

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:52.208
Can't manage a run of
crutch in the desert.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:54.875
I wait with pleasure.
You go happily.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:37.083
Good evening!

01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:38.042
So?

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.667
Still not dressed?

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:44.458
Those jumbo prawns
are weeping there for you.

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:46.583
Is Kakababu ready?-
- Kidnapped.

01:13:53.417 --> 01:13:54.417
Come.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.375
He come. He want to
meet you.

01:13:59.958 --> 01:14:00.958
At last.

01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:04.042
Yes, even I'm getting late.

01:14:07.667 --> 01:14:08.833
Let's go buddy.

01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:11.125
Let's go.

01:14:57.542 --> 01:15:00.542
Hello Professor!
Welcome to Egypt!

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:04.750
Dr. Alkadi I presume?

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.917
True, this is Africa
but I'm not Livingstone.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.833
And definitely not a doctor.

01:15:10.042 --> 01:15:13.833
Nice to know that my mother tongue
is one of the 17 languages you know.

01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:17.500
But let me also tell you,
I am not a professor either.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.292
I know. But so many Indians
teach here at the university,

01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:24.333
that we call all dignified
looking Indians, professor.

01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:26.333
And with your kind of knowledge,

01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:27.833
I don't think the name
is a misfit.

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:28.958
Thank you.

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:32.083
Have you kidnapped me and
brought me here to honour me?

01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:33.917
Why such kind words?

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.125
People use kind words in
obituaries and funerals too.

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:39.458
Isn't it Mr. Roy Choudhury?

01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:42.333
Anyway. Tea? I have some
nice Darjeeling tea.

01:15:42.792 --> 01:15:44.083
No thanks.

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:47.000
Sipping tea at one's own
funeral isn't very civil.

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:52.125
Now if you'd kindly tell me
why I was brought here,

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:54.917
because this kidnapping wasn't
there in the tourism package.

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.917
Kidnapping? For God's sake
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

01:15:57.917 --> 01:16:01.042
What are you saying! You've
come here on invitation.

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:05.667
On the contrary I heard you've
broken two of my men's wrists.

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:09.625
Do you have the tradition
of inviting at gunpoint here?

01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:10.875
Interesting.

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:14.208
And how do you propose your
love? Punching in the stomach?

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:19.625
Or do you give gift-wrapped
dynamites to kids on birthdays?

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:24.750
You're indeed a brave man.
Joking in this situation too?

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:29.542
Okay fine, I'm sorry. My men
got a bit tense and overdid it.

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:31.167
Now can we please forget that

01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:33.375
and have a quick word over
a cup of Darjeeling tea?

01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:34.458
Please?

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:42.083
The moment you get a chance, you
start shopping! Very irritating!

01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:43.292
Hmm, I know.

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:45.375
There's still time
before they come.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:47.042
Come on!-
- Oh!

01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:50.458
What 'Oh'?-
- Mowgli is on the way.

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:54.417
That's why so much of hurry.-
- Sis, please just stop this Mowgli thing.

01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:57.000
Better still, call him
Asterix. I swear!

01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:59.083
Come on!-
- Idiot,

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:02.625
Mowgli has this wild thing about
him, Asterix is an old man.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:04.708
Done?

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:06.333
Come.-
- Hello.

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:07.167
What!

01:17:07.417 --> 01:17:08.792
What are you saying?
When did this happen?

01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:10.833
I can't understand anything!

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.583
What!

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:13.792
Isn't the police doing anything?


01:17:14.042 --> 01:17:15.417
But he never told us...

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:19.333
Told him! Warned him
a hundred times!

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:21.375
Such a stubborn man!

01:17:21.542 --> 01:17:23.208
We must speak to the government

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:24.792
and the police!

01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:28.375
And of course government
official! He is an Indian citizen.

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:35.625
Coming right now. Bring him home.
What'll he do sitting there alone?

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:36.917
We better...

01:17:37.042 --> 01:17:38.292
Make other arrangements.

01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:41.167
Who is the ambassador there now?

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:44.458
Hasn't their government put
a reward on Hani Alkadi?

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:47.625
But they still couldn't capture him?
He is roaming around openly

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:48.875
kidnapping people?

01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:51.917
But we, as his family...

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.042
Don't need to go.

01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:55.542
I'll get back home and
speak to you. Bye.

01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:57.292
Bye for now.

01:17:58.958 --> 01:18:00.000
Taxi!

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:01.417
Taxi!

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:05.708
If they don't go let me know. I
too need to get prepared, right?

01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:07.875
I'm escalating the
matter right away.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.583
Just give me half
an hour. Okay?

01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:16.208
I must confess
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:18.208
Among the people I've
seen all over the world

01:18:18.375 --> 01:18:20.625
I like Indians the most.

01:18:20.875 --> 01:18:22.958
I am huge fan of your
Rabindranath Tagore's.

01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:24.917
In fact I've read him
in original.

01:18:24.917 --> 01:18:27.167
I know, noticed a copy of
"Gitanjali" in your room.

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:30.125
What was that...

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.417
"Wish I was an Arad Bedouin

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:36.708
With the undulating desert
beneath my feet".

01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:40.917
As a matter of fact at the
risk of sounding immodest,

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.667
people know me better
as a revolutionary

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.458
but I am a twice-published
poet as well.

01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:45.958
Though under a pseudonym.

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:48.250
Wow! Man of many
talents!

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:49.417
Brilliant!

01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:52.333
A Tagore's fan carrying guns,

01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:53.750
is a novel experience for me.

01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:57.250
You're finished if Vishwabharati
University finds out.

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:02.833
There you go.

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:06.292
Actually I drink two cups
of tea in the morning.

01:19:06.292 --> 01:19:08.625
Then I prefer black coffee
the rest of the day.

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:11.917
Don't waste time on the tea.
I agreed to a 'quick word'.

01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:13.500
Not to 'Darjeeling tea'.

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:15.708
And why?-
- Principle.

01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:20.125
You tried bump me off in
Delhi for no fault of mine.

01:19:20.375 --> 01:19:23.125
I'm not ready to have tea
with a cold-blooded murderer

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.458
sititng at the same table.

01:19:29.292 --> 01:19:30.042
Hossem!

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.083
Hossem!

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.708
Take out your gun!

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:53.458
And show him what you're
capable of.

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.792
Look behind you bloody fool!

01:20:54.167 --> 01:20:55.208
Bravo, Hossem!

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:03.042
Hossem is my bodyguard.
Cool headed. Immaculate aim.

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:05.375
Worked at a circus earlier.

01:21:06.208 --> 01:21:07.708
Then he was a hitman
for some time.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:13.542
Shooting you from that
distance was a cakewalk for him.

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:15.875
But we didn't want to kill you.

01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:18.625
Didn't know you back then.
Just wanted to scare you.

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:19.833
I think you're insane.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:23.250
Stood at gunpoint with an
orange in your hand to prove this?

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:29.750
We are at some gunpoint or
the other 24 hours my friend.

01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:33.875
We bathe, sleep, fight and
dream; all at gunpoint.

01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:36.875
And we're all insane in
our own way, right?

01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:41.167
Or why would someone scale
Mt. Everest with a crutch?

01:21:41.208 --> 01:21:43.750
Or even accept Hani
Alkadi's challenge?

01:21:47.125 --> 01:21:49.208
Believe me, just
wanted to scare you!

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:51.917
I just wanted to
scare you, okay?

01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:55.167
I'm sorry. Just wanted
to injure you. Right?

01:21:55.708 --> 01:21:56.833
I'm sorry.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:58.250
Now some tea please?

01:21:58.333 --> 01:22:01.667
Insisting on tea so much,
anyone would think it's poisoned.

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:23.417
Okay.

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:25.333
Tea, chit chat, circus.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.125
Now, Baba Peer's will?

01:22:30.458 --> 01:22:33.875
No! Not happening!
You're coming with us.

01:22:33.958 --> 01:22:36.500
Sidhharth, call the reception
and tell them we're checking out.

01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:39.500
Though we should sue them. He
was picked up in broad daylight!

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.125
But we don't have
time for all this.

01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:44.083
You're not getting it. Kakababu
has asked me not to leave.

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:48.083
- What if he wants to send a message?
One of us will come and check at the hotel.

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:49.625
And I don't think
Kakababu would've

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:51.125
approved of you staying
here alone all night.

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:53.667
Exactly! I've spoken
to the embassy.

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:56.500
They're sending
guards at our place.

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:59.917
Let me suggest this, I couldn't
cook at home today so,

01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:06.458
we order food and eat here, then
pack Shantu's stuff and leave.

01:23:06.458 --> 01:23:07.792
Excellent idea.
Okay Shantu?

01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:10.792
But you don't get it.-
- Another 'but'? Listen,

01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:13.500
courage without intelligence
tantamounts to stupidity.

01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:16.625
And don't you think
if we stick together

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:19.042
we'll be in a much better
position to look for Kakababu?

01:23:19.292 --> 01:23:23.167
And what's your
favorite? Hilsa caviar.

01:23:23.292 --> 01:23:26.125
Right? So want to
try Batarakh here?

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:27.292
Have a look.

01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:31.375
I thought Baba Peer was a
fakir. Not a worldly man.

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:33.958
Where does the
question of a will arise?

01:23:36.375 --> 01:23:39.417
Before becoming Baba Peer
he was a revolutionary leader.

01:23:40.208 --> 01:23:41.667
After General Nasser
became the President

01:23:41.708 --> 01:23:43.375
and democracy returned to Egypt

01:23:43.792 --> 01:23:46.250
Baba Peer disbanded his group.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.750
With that the information of his
group's fund and arms was lost.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:56.250
And I'm sure his will written in
Hieroglyphics is the key to that.

01:23:58.917 --> 01:24:02.208
So give us those pictures,
we'll leave you.

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:05.833
Not with me, those
are with Al Mamun.

01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:08.250
I saw them. But he
didn't give them to me.

01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:12.250
Oh no! I heard you stole
them and fled to Egypt.

01:24:12.417 --> 01:24:16.542
No. I don't know which gossip
magazine you subscribe to but

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:18.500
those are with Al Mamun.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:23.708
But neither you nor Al Mamun
can decipher it.

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:26.500
Fair enough.

01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:29.750
Then you tell me what
he wrote before dying.

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:31.083
I'm sorry.

01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:34.875
Baba Peer's strict orders were to not
divulge anything before I investigate.

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:38.125
Al Mamun offered me
lakhs, didn't tell him,

01:24:38.125 --> 01:24:41.708
didn't tell my nephew Shantu,
or my friend, Narendra.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:45.042
Then why will I tell you?
Because of this Darjeeling tea?

01:24:52.542 --> 01:24:54.708
You mocking me? Me!

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.625
Challenging me huh?

01:24:56.792 --> 01:25:00.083
Listen Roy Choudhury, you're from
the land of Gandhi and Budhha.

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:03.458
So let's do this non-violently. Or
I'll be forced to slash your throat

01:25:03.458 --> 01:25:06.333
and put up that video on
Youtube for your family.

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:10.583
And my severed head with blab
the meaning to you.

01:25:12.292 --> 01:25:14.292
Leading a revolution
with this intelligence?

01:25:14.292 --> 01:25:16.333
You're crossing your limit!-
- Shut up!

01:25:16.792 --> 01:25:18.542
Just shut up!

01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:20.917
You're shouting unnecessarily.

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:25.250
Not just Gandhi or Budhha,
another man hailed from our country.

01:25:25.833 --> 01:25:28.375
In fact he used to live in my
neighborhood, in Bhawanipur.

01:25:28.792 --> 01:25:30.625
Subhash Chandra Bose,
must've heard of him?

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:31.542
Professor you...

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.167
Listen Professor

01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:51.542
you come from the largest
democracy in the world.

01:25:51.792 --> 01:25:55.167
Have any idea what 31 years
of emergency rule looks like?

01:25:55.458 --> 01:25:57.333
Have you smelt it?

01:25:57.917 --> 01:25:59.333
Where the police can
keep a man in the jail

01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:01.583
for months for
no rhyme or reason!

01:26:01.667 --> 01:26:03.125
Torturing him!

01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:05.958
Where you don't have the right to
protest, to have demonstrations.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.125
Where freedom is sold in
the black market at a premium.

01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:10.208
Where, for corruption,

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:13.292
ministers' income and unemployment
increase at the same rate!

01:26:15.417 --> 01:26:16.458
No.

01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:20.000
You don't know
and you never will.

01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:36.125
My country is bleeding,
Professor.

01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.708
And as long as
Jashne Mubarak is in power

01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:42.542
it'll continue to do so.

01:26:46.042 --> 01:26:51.125
We're planning a civil disobedience
and an armed rebellion next year

01:26:51.167 --> 01:26:52.708
to topple the government.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:55.625
We've to fight his police, his
army, his administration!

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:59.375
And for that we'll need a
lot of money and arms.

01:27:04.458 --> 01:27:07.167
Can you donate a bit of your
democracy to us, Professor?

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:20.167
"Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high

01:27:20.167 --> 01:27:27.250
Where knowledge is free, where
the world has not been broken up

01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:31.000
fragments by narrow
domestic walls".

01:27:34.542 --> 01:27:40.375
There's no indication of money or
arms in Baba Pir's last sketches.

01:27:40.792 --> 01:27:44.875
It is a request to investigate
a historical event.

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:50.792
If, in that process I find any lead
to money or arms, I promise

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.583
you'll be the first
person to know.

01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:56.542
But in return I need
some help from you.

01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:01.708
To fulfill his last wishes

01:28:01.708 --> 01:28:05.542
I've to go to the bottom of
a certain pyramid or

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:08.250
or might have to go down
the well of a certain tomb.

01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:13.292
For that I need a guide
named Daago Abdullah

01:28:13.292 --> 01:28:16.875
who I had befriended
here years ago.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:23.000
Along with him I need a jeep,
tools and of course, my nephew.

01:28:24.167 --> 01:28:25.792
Can you arrange for all this?

01:28:32.417 --> 01:28:35.458
"Where the clear stream of reason
has not lost its way

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.250
Into the dreary desert
sand of dead habit

01:28:40.625 --> 01:28:43.458
Where the mind is led
forward by thee

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:47.000
Into ever-widening thought
and action

01:28:48.375 --> 01:28:51.792
Into that heaven of
freedom, my Father

01:28:51.792 --> 01:28:54.917
let my Egypt awake".

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:00.417
<i>Shantu, I am doing fine.</i>

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.708
<i>They're taking good care of me.
Hani Alkadi isn't a bad guy.</i>

01:29:05.292 --> 01:29:10.458
<i>I quite like him. After this we'll
go on an expedition from here.</i>

01:29:10.917 --> 01:29:13.375
<i>Here's what you have
to do, listen carefully.</i>

01:29:14.042 --> 01:29:17.958
<i>The man carrying this letter will
rent you a camel tomorrow morning.</i>

01:29:18.375 --> 01:29:21.333
<i>On that camel
you'll reach Saqqara.</i>

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.917
<i>There is the Step pyramid at
Saqqara. The oldest of pyramids.</i>

01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:27.875
<i>It has steps going up, like stairs,
you'll have no problem to find it.</i>

01:29:28.333 --> 01:29:31.708
"Wait there. A man from
here will come to get you.

01:29:31.708 --> 01:29:35.250
Do not inform police and
be very careful on the way.

01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:36.458
P.S..."

01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:38.083
<i>How is my to be
daughter-in-law doing?</i>

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.417
Go on.-
- Huh?

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.917
P.S.?-
- No, there is no P.S.

01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:48.750
What? It has to be there!
It's a must! I'll read it out.

01:29:48.917 --> 01:29:52.583
It was a slip of tongue!-
- No, let me read it.

01:29:52.583 --> 01:29:54.125
One second!

01:29:54.208 --> 01:29:56.292
The man who gave you the
letter, what did he say?

01:29:56.333 --> 01:29:58.708
He asked me to reach Giza
by car tomorrow morning.

01:29:58.792 --> 01:30:00.292
A camel will be
ready there by ten.

01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:04.083
Fine. We reach Giza by
ten. We'll leave together.

01:30:04.083 --> 01:30:06.208
Exactly.-
- As in?

01:30:06.458 --> 01:30:08.750
You guys can't come.
He'll be very angry.

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:10.292
He asked me to go alone.
Why will you all go?

01:30:10.292 --> 01:30:12.375
Alone? You didn't read
out the entire letter.

01:30:12.458 --> 01:30:15.875
He asked not to get police. IPS
not allowed. But IFS allowed.

01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:17.792
And IFS's wife and
sister-in-law too.

01:30:17.792 --> 01:30:18.792
Yes of course, naturally.

01:30:18.792 --> 01:30:20.167
Don't do this!

01:30:20.167 --> 01:30:22.000
Wanted to see Hani
Alkadi since childhood!

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.292
Oh God! Why don't you get it? Is
this a picnic? Can be dangerous!

01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:29.667
What if you get into a problem?-
- Our coming along will help you.

01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:31.125
Okay!

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:32.458
Okay!

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:38.333
Think we'll miss the live telecast
of a thriller and sit home?

01:30:38.708 --> 01:30:39.792
It's decided then.

01:30:39.875 --> 01:30:44.542
We'll go to Step pyramid on
camel as normal tourists.

01:30:44.542 --> 01:30:45.958
Exactly.-
- Alright?

01:30:46.792 --> 01:30:47.375
P.S.?

01:30:47.667 --> 01:30:48.917
Let's go then!

01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:09.250
How far, Sidhharth da?

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:12.375
Never been to Step pyramid.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.750
Wait, let's ask this guy.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.667
So brother... oh sorry...

01:32:18.667 --> 01:32:22.792
Excuse me, I want to know
how far is Saqqara.

01:32:22.792 --> 01:32:24.750
Very close, Master.
Not too far.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.583
How close?
How many miles?

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:30.125
No miles, Master. Not too far.-
- No miles? How many kilometers?

01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:33.333
Very close Master. Not too far.-
- Not too far?

01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:38.417
Shantu, he is saying it's not
too far. But I still doubt it.

01:32:38.417 --> 01:32:40.458
Looking all around I feel...

01:32:42.292 --> 01:32:44.417
Hey Shantu!-
- Yes, tell me.

01:32:45.042 --> 01:32:47.375
Is someone following us?

01:32:48.042 --> 01:32:50.375
Where? Which side?-
- Over there. See!

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.708
Yes. Someone is!

01:32:57.917 --> 01:32:58.667
Huh!

01:32:58.667 --> 01:33:00.958
I think he is chasing us.
Very fast.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.542
What are you saying!-
- Sidhharth...

01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:07.083
what if they're the
police or local dacoits!

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:10.958
What do we do if they have guns?

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:13.292
Guns? Who asked you
to come?

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:17.250
Warned you time and
again. But you insisted!

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:19.833
Now where's all the
adventure gone?

01:33:20.542 --> 01:33:22.208
Could be police too.

01:33:22.208 --> 01:33:25.292
Hani Alkadi is on Egyptian
police's most wanted list.

01:33:25.292 --> 01:33:27.708
Maybe they want to reach
Hani Alkadi following us.

01:33:28.625 --> 01:33:30.000
Whoever that guy is,

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:33.625
we've to reach Step pyramid
before he catches up.

01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:35.667
Okay.-
- Kakababu's emissary is waiting there.

01:33:35.667 --> 01:33:38.208
Yes, you're right.-
- Tell him.

01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:42.708
Ask him to go fast!-
- Yes, I'm telling him!

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:45.708
Camel can run?

01:33:45.875 --> 01:33:51.042
Yes, Master. Salma can run,
kneel down, lie down, jump.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:54.250
Okay. Good.
Please make it run.

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:56.458
Run! Run faster!

01:33:56.458 --> 01:33:59.375
Goons are after us
brother! Make it run fast!

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.208
What happened?-
- Cannot go further.

01:34:43.375 --> 01:34:45.042
What! But why?-
- Look.

01:34:51.042 --> 01:34:52.958
What is he saying!-
- See...

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:55.917
wherever we go...-
- danger follows us.

01:34:56.583 --> 01:35:00.667
There's nothing we can do. We've to
stop and get down. Or we'll die.

01:35:38.917 --> 01:35:40.667
Are you guys alright?

01:35:41.458 --> 01:35:43.458
Yes, I'm fine.

01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:46.750
Okay?

01:35:47.667 --> 01:35:49.375
Can't see that man anymore.

01:35:52.417 --> 01:35:56.750
Surely he has lost us.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.125
Let's go. We mustn't get late.-
- Yes, right. Let's go.

01:36:02.125 --> 01:36:05.125
One, two.

01:36:05.125 --> 01:36:07.458
One, two.

01:36:07.458 --> 01:36:09.000
One, two.

01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:20.792
One, two.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.542
Good afternoon.

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:54.583
Care for a guided tour?

01:36:55.083 --> 01:36:57.542
Why not!-
- Okay then. Come.

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:03.833
What do you think? The sky will
clear up like this after the storm?

01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:06.667
For the sake of my
country I hope so.

01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:09.375
Okay Professor, tell
me something.

01:37:09.667 --> 01:37:12.417
I like the colour of the sky
much more than the earth's.

01:37:12.583 --> 01:37:15.208
But why can't I see
green in it ever?

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:19.917
You know... blue, white,
golden...

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:23.583
silver, orange, yellow, red,

01:37:23.583 --> 01:37:26.167
even black. But
never green!

01:37:26.167 --> 01:37:28.500
Oh my God! Listen.

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:32.042
You'd better leave all this and

01:37:32.542 --> 01:37:35.542
concentrate on your
third book of poetry.

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:49.875
I know what you're
thinking professor.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.583
What you're thinking is right.

01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:57.083
They belong to schools. But
you know why they're here?

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:01.833
To revise their
text books at school.

01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:05.250
So that instead of studying
the biography of Jashne Mubarak,

01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:08.375
they can study the real
history of Egypt.

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:20.292
Is that them?-
- I think so.

01:38:20.833 --> 01:38:23.333
Are you sure they're the
ones Kakababu sent?

01:38:23.333 --> 01:38:25.792
Wait. I can't make out from
here, have to go and check.

01:38:26.167 --> 01:38:28.292
Hey wait.
Don't go alone.

01:38:28.375 --> 01:38:29.500
Wait.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.625
- Is it them?
- See properly.

01:38:32.625 --> 01:38:33.500
Yes, I think so.

01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:35.708
- Do you recognize them?
- Yes.

01:38:35.708 --> 01:38:38.083
Yes, that's Al Mamun.
Come on!

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:42.583
Go with him and see!-
- I'm going!

01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:48.000
Go with him.-
- Wait. He knows him.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.542
- Thank God you're here!
- Ask where Kakababu is.

01:38:53.292 --> 01:38:55.958
Kakababu was kidnapped by
Hani Alkadi's men yesterday.

01:38:55.958 --> 01:38:58.083
And then we got a
strange letter from him

01:38:58.083 --> 01:39:00.583
where Kakababu said he's going
to send men at the Step pyramid

01:39:00.583 --> 01:39:03.125
to pick me up...-
- Shantu!

01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:06.500
They weren't sent by him!
Siddhart!

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.583
Take this bloody insect away!

01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.875
Get him, right now!

01:39:11.042 --> 01:39:13.625
Run! Run!
Let's go!

01:39:15.833 --> 01:39:18.000
They're hitting him!

01:39:20.417 --> 01:39:23.458
Don't let them go Shantu!-
- Don't hit him!

01:39:25.667 --> 01:39:28.917
- Be quiet, Rini!
- Shontu run!

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:33.375
They're hitting him!-
- I can see that.

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:34.250
Rini!

01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:37.583
They're taking him
away, do something!

01:39:42.333 --> 01:39:43.958
Bring the dog.

01:39:45.917 --> 01:39:46.917
Okay!

01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:48.125
You keep shut!

01:39:52.542 --> 01:39:54.917
Now listen, Daago Abdullah.

01:39:56.208 --> 01:39:58.542
Listen very carefully.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.250
Very precise at short distance.

01:40:01.458 --> 01:40:03.875
I really like it.
I always keep it with me.

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:10.958
From Germany.
Very easy to carry.

01:40:12.708 --> 01:40:15.208
We found him hiding in
Alexandria, Sir,

01:40:15.292 --> 01:40:18.583
after betraying two of
our men to the police.

01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:27.583
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

01:40:27.583 --> 01:40:29.208
They offered lots of money,

01:40:29.208 --> 01:40:31.417
I couldn't resist myself
my lord...

01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:32.583
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

01:40:32.583 --> 01:40:49.667
(speaking Egyptian)

01:40:49.667 --> 01:40:54.375
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:56.833
Professor, could you
kindly look away?

01:40:57.875 --> 01:40:59.333
Why?

01:41:00.167 --> 01:41:04.458
Believe me Professor, I really want
to author my third book of poetry,

01:41:04.917 --> 01:41:07.000
You tell me, do I have a choice?

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:10.000
If I let him go he'll
weaken the movement again.

01:41:10.042 --> 01:41:12.542
Listen Alkadi, don't do this.

01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:16.167
I know justice must prevail.
I know he erred...

01:41:16.167 --> 01:41:18.875
Nothing. Zilch.
You know nothing!

01:41:18.875 --> 01:41:21.417
Know what the police will do
to those two comrades of mine?

01:41:21.417 --> 01:41:23.958
They'll tear their nails off.
Then hit them under the feet.

01:41:23.958 --> 01:41:26.292
They use iron rods to...-
- Listen Alkadi...

01:41:26.458 --> 01:41:29.375
want to take a man's life,
take it in a battlefield.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:32.125
Like a man. Killing
an unarmed man

01:41:32.125 --> 01:41:35.167
won't add to the
glory of your revolution.

01:41:40.542 --> 01:41:43.583
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:48.958
Is this alright Professor?

01:41:51.292 --> 01:41:53.500
Please shoot me at
your convenience,

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.792
because if you miss, I hit.

01:41:59.875 --> 01:42:03.250
I don't like wars either,
Professor. Or killing.

01:42:04.708 --> 01:42:07.708
But the situation my country is
in, freedom comes at a price.

01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:09.542
And someone has to pay
the price, right?

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:12.708
But if your funds are depleted
in order to pay off that...

01:42:40.125 --> 01:42:42.917
Self-defence, Professor.
Is that okay with you?

01:42:58.958 --> 01:43:05.833
(all singing)

01:43:08.167 --> 01:43:12.875
(singing)

01:43:44.083 --> 01:43:47.333
I must say, Professor, you're
looking like a pucca Egyptian.

01:43:47.542 --> 01:43:49.792
Don't laugh, this is disgusting!

01:43:50.292 --> 01:43:51.958
Now onwards, when
you kidnap someone,

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:54.583
don't forget to kidnap his
suitcase too. Please.

01:44:00.542 --> 01:44:02.167
See that man, Professor?

01:44:02.667 --> 01:44:04.333
That old man over there.

01:44:05.167 --> 01:44:08.875
He's from our village. He taught
me to play the Simsimaya in childhood.

01:44:09.625 --> 01:44:12.167
Simsimaya...
sounds familiar.

01:44:12.667 --> 01:44:14.417
Is this a stringed instrument?

01:44:14.792 --> 01:44:15.917
Like a harp?

01:44:16.875 --> 01:44:19.417
Seriously Professor, is there
anything you don't know?

01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:26.750
Feels strange you know,

01:44:27.458 --> 01:44:29.750
from those carefree
days of my fishing village

01:44:31.042 --> 01:44:33.000
to these nights on the
run in the desert.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.292
You know, had no
worries back then.

01:44:37.458 --> 01:44:41.250
Played around all day,
wouldn't go to the Madrasa.

01:44:43.958 --> 01:44:44.750
There was a girl.

01:44:47.208 --> 01:44:48.375
Freida.

01:44:50.292 --> 01:44:52.125
Eyes as deep as the river Nile.

01:44:55.333 --> 01:44:57.000
I'd go to meet her secretly.

01:44:57.542 --> 01:44:58.500
Secretly?

01:44:58.667 --> 01:44:59.750
Why?

01:45:00.792 --> 01:45:05.000
Coptic Christian. Our village was
very regressive about such things.

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:07.917
Where in India were you born?-
- Kolkata.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.833
I was born there. Though
in the Refugee Colony.

01:45:12.625 --> 01:45:14.917
My grandfather came
over after the partition.

01:45:15.083 --> 01:45:18.708
I'm from a fishing
village too, Bikrampur.

01:45:19.292 --> 01:45:21.583
After the partition, so...

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:25.125
East Pakistan.-
- No. East Bengal.

01:45:25.625 --> 01:45:26.875
Now Bangladesh.

01:45:31.583 --> 01:45:35.292
You guys need a lot of money,
why not approach Al Mamun?

01:45:35.708 --> 01:45:38.542
He's quite a generous
and helpful man.

01:45:42.167 --> 01:45:44.000
Are you insane?

01:45:44.083 --> 01:45:46.000
We'll take help from Al Mamun?

01:45:46.042 --> 01:45:48.125
That greedy, lowly,
evil son of a pimp?

01:45:50.333 --> 01:45:52.292
More he earns,
the more greedy he gets.

01:45:52.542 --> 01:45:55.208
So selfish, he took Baba Pir
to Delhi for his treatment.

01:45:55.375 --> 01:45:56.625
Slow-poisoned him there.

01:45:56.667 --> 01:45:58.667
So Baba Pir would tell
him everything before dying.

01:45:58.792 --> 01:46:00.458
We'll take his help? We?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.292
- Who never...
- Master...

01:46:02.292 --> 01:46:03.500
Master...

01:46:03.792 --> 01:46:06.167
Master...-
- Daago!

01:46:07.125 --> 01:46:08.917
What happened Daago?
Who did this to you?

01:46:08.917 --> 01:46:11.500
Where is the boy?-
- Master, I am sorry.

01:46:12.125 --> 01:46:16.042
Could not fight them.
Too many they were.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.167
Waiting.

01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:22.875
They take the boy.
Give the letter.

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:26.167
Water! Some water please!

01:46:26.792 --> 01:46:28.208
Come here quickly!

01:46:39.083 --> 01:46:40.125
Come on!
Get going!

01:46:48.292 --> 01:46:49.667
Where is Shantu?

01:46:51.667 --> 01:46:53.458
Alkadi, where is Shantu?

01:46:55.333 --> 01:46:56.708
What happened to Shantu?

01:47:00.792 --> 01:47:01.833
Where is Shantu?

01:47:10.583 --> 01:47:14.042
Kidnapped the boy right in front of
us and we couldn't do anything!

01:47:14.167 --> 01:47:17.542
What could you've done?
Fought their guns with sandals?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.250
And then you'd beat up
Al Mamun with your hand-fan?

01:47:21.833 --> 01:47:23.542
Even the embassy has backed out.

01:47:23.833 --> 01:47:28.250
They say, nothing can be done
until the Indian Govt. steps in.

01:47:28.792 --> 01:47:30.792
The situation is that delicate.

01:47:31.625 --> 01:47:34.250
Listen, can't we go
check at Saqqara once?

01:47:34.458 --> 01:47:36.708
Just in case anyone's
seen a guide...

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:39.792
Wait, I'll get this.-
- One second. Don't open!

01:47:40.958 --> 01:47:43.292
This could be dangerous.

01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:17.083
- You hit me!
- Quiet!

01:48:17.083 --> 01:48:18.875
What are you doing?-
- Let me see!

01:48:19.583 --> 01:48:21.042
Move, let me see.

01:48:30.083 --> 01:48:31.208
Good evening.

01:48:32.208 --> 01:48:35.000
My name is Narendra Verma.
I work for the CBI.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.542
Wait, move. Let me see.

01:48:39.583 --> 01:48:42.083
I'm a close friend of your
Kakababu.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.292
Please come in.
Please be seated.

01:48:47.542 --> 01:48:51.583
You guys are weird! Kept shouting
and screaming in the morning

01:48:51.583 --> 01:48:53.542
and you guys vanished
with the camels!

01:48:55.667 --> 01:48:57.042
Hello...

01:48:57.292 --> 01:48:58.250
Shantu!

01:48:58.667 --> 01:49:01.042
Hello... listen to me,
stop!

01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:06.500
Were you guys cooking?-
- Err... no...

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.667
Yes... no.

01:49:08.917 --> 01:49:12.458
No, not actually.-
- Those won't be enough.

01:49:13.083 --> 01:49:15.500
Hani Alkadi and Al Mamun,
aren't petty criminals.

01:49:17.208 --> 01:49:19.083
Anyway. Sit.-
- Yes... err...

01:49:19.792 --> 01:49:21.500
Let me go over and cross check.

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.833
What all has happened so far,

01:49:23.875 --> 01:49:27.208
however small or
insignificant it may be,

01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:28.583
tell me.

01:49:30.625 --> 01:49:32.625
The Lowly, the Rotten, the Dirty

01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:34.042
I'll teach him a lesson!

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.542
I'll tear out his liver and
feed it to the falcons!

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:37.958
No.

01:49:39.167 --> 01:49:40.125
No?

01:49:40.625 --> 01:49:44.417
Didn't you hear what he wrote?
He's insulted me! Threatened me!

01:49:44.417 --> 01:49:46.167
I heard only one thing

01:49:47.125 --> 01:49:49.750
if you don't accept their
condition within 12 hours,

01:49:50.042 --> 01:49:51.458
they will kill Shantu.

01:49:52.375 --> 01:49:55.083
Their condition? As in
handing you over to them?

01:49:55.667 --> 01:49:57.208
Give up Baba Peer's bounty

01:49:57.208 --> 01:49:58.917
to that... to that bloody...-
- Listen Alkadi,

01:50:00.417 --> 01:50:03.000
You both continue
the tug of war with

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Baba Pir's imaginery
treasure if you want to.

01:50:06.042 --> 01:50:09.292
Don't involve me or my
nephew in this. Please.

01:50:10.875 --> 01:50:12.750
Write them a letter right now.

01:50:13.875 --> 01:50:16.792
If they bring Shantu at the temple
near the Sphinx tomorrow,

01:50:17.167 --> 01:50:20.333
then they can be a part of
the expedition like you guys.

01:50:21.208 --> 01:50:23.750
They will wait with
you at the complex.

01:50:24.667 --> 01:50:28.292
I, Shantu and Daago will
set out for the location.

01:50:29.375 --> 01:50:32.750
If I find any treasure or
wealth there at all

01:50:33.292 --> 01:50:35.875
it will be split
between you two.

01:50:36.708 --> 01:50:38.917
But if they don't bring
Shantu, then

01:50:39.958 --> 01:50:43.333
I'll die but won't speak
a word about the will.

01:50:43.792 --> 01:50:47.375
Sharing the booty! You're
asking me to share that?

01:50:47.792 --> 01:50:50.417
Something that is for my
country! Our homeland!

01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:54.958
How dare you! I'll die but...-
- A lot of people can die, Alkadi.

01:50:56.667 --> 01:50:58.917
No one will gain from that.

01:50:59.625 --> 01:51:03.458
We've very little time. Don't
behave like an emotional idiot.

01:51:29.583 --> 01:51:31.542
Listen Alkadi,

01:51:32.042 --> 01:51:34.875
all my life willingly
or unwillingly

01:51:35.708 --> 01:51:37.875
I have given up a lot of things.

01:51:37.917 --> 01:51:42.042
In an expedition to Afghanistan,
I lost my foot in an accident.

01:51:42.042 --> 01:51:43.375
And independence.

01:51:43.708 --> 01:51:46.750
So the whiny middle-
class Bengali offers me

01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:49.208
the seat reserved for the
Handicapped on buses.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.833
I've lived alone all my
life, without marrying.

01:51:53.250 --> 01:51:57.167
Have denied my heart so I can
lead my life on my own terms.

01:51:58.625 --> 01:52:03.583
But Shantu is a part of me, my
most beloved part. My blood

01:52:04.917 --> 01:52:08.833
who I have mentored with much
care, exactly the way I wanted.

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:13.167
I will not and cannot
give up on him.

01:52:13.542 --> 01:52:14.958
Under no circumstances.

01:52:15.542 --> 01:52:19.000
That day you pleaded
for a bit of democracy

01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:24.500
and I beg of you for
a bit of my life.

01:52:25.667 --> 01:52:26.875
Please.

01:52:35.625 --> 01:52:36.792
Paper.

01:52:38.083 --> 01:52:41.250
Al Mamun runs a group behind
the cape of his business.

01:52:41.542 --> 01:52:45.458
A mole in that group
leaked the news.

01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:48.625
Remember Alkadi,
you people will wait at Giza.

01:52:48.708 --> 01:52:50.333
We've to go alone from there.

01:52:50.792 --> 01:52:54.417
But I can't understand where
will Kakababu and Shantu go?

01:52:55.167 --> 01:52:56.667
No one knows that.

01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:58.833
Neither Al Mamun nor Alkadi.

01:52:59.208 --> 01:53:02.875
Because if you follow me then
Al Mamun will follow you too.

01:53:02.875 --> 01:53:05.792
It will turn into a nasty situation,
we'll all be at a loss then.

01:53:06.417 --> 01:53:08.000
Don't worry, I won't follow.

01:53:08.542 --> 01:53:12.708
But they'll both wait at Giza
hiding within the crowd of tourists

01:53:13.375 --> 01:53:15.125
as per Kakababu's order.

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.792
And we'll shadow them
as per your orders and

01:53:17.875 --> 01:53:19.833
with us we will have
the Egyptian police.

01:53:19.875 --> 01:53:23.333
Heard that police is coming
to Giza to capture Hani Alkadi.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:26.542
If I get caught, police will torture
in the lock-up, trial for treason and

01:53:26.542 --> 01:53:28.583
A public hanging.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.250
So couldn't we just go about
without involving them?

01:53:33.333 --> 01:53:34.333
Too late.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.500
Police?

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.083
Who informed the police?

01:53:38.333 --> 01:53:42.125
Heard he is your friend. CBI
officer sent by Indian Govt.

01:53:42.792 --> 01:53:43.833
Always follows me!

01:53:43.875 --> 01:53:45.000
Are you sure

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.167
you guys want to go?

01:53:46.625 --> 01:53:48.167
Huh? It could be dangerous.-
- Let me speak!

01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:50.583
I mean, yes of course.

01:53:50.875 --> 01:53:51.875
Sis?

01:53:52.417 --> 01:53:55.083
Yes, of course!
Mr. Verma I mean

01:53:55.375 --> 01:53:59.250
if Kakababu can plunge into an
operation like this with his crutch

01:53:59.458 --> 01:54:02.833
if a young boy like Shantu
can get involved in it then...

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.125
then why can't my basket ball
champ wife and her ferocious sister?

01:54:06.125 --> 01:54:08.417
Thrilling emotions,
the movie's a hit!

01:54:08.583 --> 01:54:11.250
You're just too much!-
- Just shut up!

01:54:11.250 --> 01:54:13.375
How can you joke in
such a critical situation?

01:54:13.375 --> 01:54:15.542
(indistinct quarreling)

01:54:15.542 --> 01:54:16.375
Okay.

01:54:16.833 --> 01:54:21.250
I'm sorry Alkadi, don't go to
Giza today, your life is too precious.

01:54:21.625 --> 01:54:24.875
I promise to inform you if
I find anything.

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.458
I know.

01:54:27.792 --> 01:54:29.083
But Al Mamun won't
let that happen

01:54:29.292 --> 01:54:30.750
because he will be there.

01:54:30.875 --> 01:54:32.208
So I'll have to go.

01:54:33.875 --> 01:54:36.500
Don't worry. You go ahead.
I'll come with a bit of make-up.

01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:37.667
Make-up?

01:54:38.917 --> 01:54:40.958
Last act of the play.
Will need some make-up, right?

01:54:42.958 --> 01:54:44.917
Then let's get going?

01:54:45.083 --> 01:54:48.208
The game begins in two hours.

01:55:02.917 --> 01:55:04.000
Comrade!

01:55:07.583 --> 01:55:09.500
Long live the revolution!

01:56:41.625 --> 01:56:44.375
Master, sure they will come?

01:56:59.292 --> 01:57:02.000
Hey, we wait here.
You not come;

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.458
Indian girl, Indian man,
Indian woman, all dead!

01:57:05.708 --> 01:57:06.583
Understand?

01:57:06.792 --> 01:57:08.708
Morse code would've
worked better.

01:57:08.917 --> 01:57:11.125
Are you alright?-
- Yes, I'm okay.

01:57:11.292 --> 01:57:13.750
My head hurts a bit.-
- Happens.

01:57:14.458 --> 01:57:17.167
Come on Abdullah, let's go.

01:57:51.375 --> 01:57:53.667
I know he is here. But...

01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:02.667
Stop clicking 25 pictures per
second like Japanese tourists.

01:58:02.667 --> 01:58:07.250
You only asked me to
mingle with the crowd.

01:58:08.167 --> 01:58:10.917
Now you're overdoing it!-
- Was necessary.

01:58:10.917 --> 01:58:13.042
They'll understand.-
- No one can understand.

01:58:13.042 --> 01:58:16.250
But where's Hani Alkadi?-
- Quiet! Softly!

01:58:17.167 --> 01:58:19.833
No idea. But the police
has arrived.

01:58:24.417 --> 01:58:27.083
There, that small pyramid?
That's our aim.

01:58:27.208 --> 01:58:28.667
We've to go below that.

01:58:28.917 --> 01:58:30.083
That, Master?

01:58:31.167 --> 01:58:32.875
But no go over there!
Nothing there!

01:58:32.875 --> 01:58:35.917
Daago, let's not waste
time. Keep going.

01:58:37.167 --> 01:58:38.125
Yes, Master.

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:47.792
Sir!-
- What?

01:59:48.083 --> 01:59:51.250
What happened?-
- I want to see Sphinx.

01:59:51.583 --> 01:59:54.375
Sphinx, go that way.-
- I'm walking, no Sphinx.

01:59:54.375 --> 01:59:57.417
Go that way.-
- No! Here is pyramid

01:59:57.667 --> 01:59:59.583
but I want to see Sphinx.

01:59:59.583 --> 02:00:03.833
Okay, walk that way.-
- No, I'm walking and walking.

02:00:03.833 --> 02:00:06.750
No seeing Sphinx.
I want to see Sphinx.

02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:09.042
I'm very busy. I'm looking
for someone right now.

02:00:09.333 --> 02:00:11.583
Where is your tour guide?-
- No guide. You guide?

02:00:11.833 --> 02:00:14.208
I will get someone to help
you. You stand here.

02:00:15.458 --> 02:00:17.708
Get me someone. Hey!

02:00:17.708 --> 02:00:19.125
I love Sphinx!

02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:32.750
Careful.

02:00:33.583 --> 02:00:35.292
Don't raise your head.

02:00:41.875 --> 02:00:43.208
Slowly.

02:00:43.333 --> 02:00:44.458
Yes.

02:00:47.042 --> 02:00:49.625
Do you remember
that labyrinth, Daago?

02:00:50.375 --> 02:00:52.375
Came so many years back.

02:00:53.292 --> 02:00:55.125
I have forgotten.

02:00:56.625 --> 02:00:59.292
You go to there?-
- Yes.

02:01:02.417 --> 02:01:03.458
But...

02:01:04.292 --> 02:01:05.833
only me

02:01:06.375 --> 02:01:08.125
and him. Not you.

02:01:08.625 --> 02:01:09.833
What!

02:01:10.292 --> 02:01:11.208
What is he saying!

02:01:11.333 --> 02:01:12.333
Master...

02:01:12.583 --> 02:01:15.542
Alkadi murder me!-
- Don't worry.

02:01:15.708 --> 02:01:18.917
I've promised Baba Peer, I'll have
to be the first person to know.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.333
Don't worry Daago. Wait here.
We will both come back.

02:01:22.792 --> 02:01:25.292
Don't worry friend. Just wait.-
- Yes.

02:01:25.708 --> 02:01:26.625
Come!

02:01:26.667 --> 02:01:27.917
Master...

02:01:28.333 --> 02:01:30.292
Don't leave me, Master...

02:01:30.417 --> 02:01:32.875
Not to worry. Wait,
my friend. Wait.

02:01:36.917 --> 02:01:38.000
Master...

02:01:38.375 --> 02:01:42.000
Al Qadi will kill me, Master,
if I let you go alone!

02:02:02.583 --> 02:02:04.375
Decided yet?

02:02:04.542 --> 02:02:05.667
What?

02:02:09.042 --> 02:02:10.958
Didn't you tell me at the hotel,

02:02:12.583 --> 02:02:15.125
that you haven't decided if you

02:02:16.208 --> 02:02:19.042
believe in ghosts or not.

02:02:34.792 --> 02:02:35.750
Come.

02:02:45.542 --> 02:02:47.458
Careful!

02:02:53.792 --> 02:02:55.417
I was asking...

02:02:55.542 --> 02:02:56.625
are we going to

02:02:56.958 --> 02:02:58.417
Queen Hetakoris'...-

02:02:58.417 --> 02:03:00.167
Not Hetakoris.

02:03:00.292 --> 02:03:01.417
Hetepheres.

02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:05.750
We'll have to come out
crawling out of here.

02:03:06.583 --> 02:03:08.583
Remember I told you...

02:03:08.792 --> 02:03:13.750
that the Queen often goes out
on walks at night even today.

02:03:13.958 --> 02:03:17.500
Only if she let's us walk back-
- Decided.

02:03:18.375 --> 02:03:21.125
What?-
- I believe in ghosts.

02:03:23.042 --> 02:03:24.125
Good.

02:03:33.083 --> 02:03:35.167
I got confused.
Let's go that way.

02:03:48.917 --> 02:03:52.292
According to the calculations
this should be a dead end.

02:03:53.375 --> 02:03:54.917
Go check once.-
- Yes.

02:04:01.208 --> 02:04:03.208
Yes Kakababu, dead end.

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:08.208
Then let's fulfill Mufti
Mohammad's last wish.

02:04:08.208 --> 02:04:11.208
Now that we're here with
that old man's challenge

02:04:12.917 --> 02:04:15.000
let's get to finishing it fast!

02:05:42.083 --> 02:05:44.042
Let's push it.-
- Okay.

02:06:04.417 --> 02:06:05.708
Good.

02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:09.625
Knew it.

02:06:13.958 --> 02:06:15.333
Now...

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.625
Phase two.

02:06:30.083 --> 02:06:35.250
Now, I will have to disclose Mufti
Mohammad's last wish to you

02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:39.125
because without your help
that wish cannot be fulfilled.

02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:42.083
I have been able to
guess some of it.

02:06:42.583 --> 02:06:43.667
Let's hear.

02:06:44.708 --> 02:06:47.042
Queen Hetepheres' mummy
is hidden somewhere here.

02:06:47.875 --> 02:06:50.375
Along with it there is a
treasure and weapons

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.875
which is what Al Mamun
and Alkadi are after.

02:06:56.833 --> 02:06:58.125
You'll get half the point.

02:06:59.917 --> 02:07:02.583
Because jewellery, treasure, etc.

02:07:03.333 --> 02:07:05.333
Mufti Mohammad
never spoke of all this.

02:07:05.583 --> 02:07:06.958
He says,

02:07:08.208 --> 02:07:11.375
Mufti Mohammad and a
guide named Al bukhari

02:07:11.375 --> 02:07:16.458
discovered the tunnel under
this pyramid and this chamber.

02:07:17.375 --> 02:07:21.208
But the credit went to

02:07:21.208 --> 02:07:22.417
the Europeans.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.833
So they took the mummy from
here and hid it somewhere else

02:07:27.833 --> 02:07:29.708
<i>to teach the Sahib a lesson.</i>

02:07:30.375 --> 02:07:32.875
<i>Later, they'd often
hide it away and</i>

02:07:32.875 --> 02:07:35.667
bring it back to the
sarcophagus as a prank.

02:07:36.375 --> 02:07:39.167
From this, a myth of
the ghost was born.

02:07:39.458 --> 02:07:40.792
Before dying,

02:07:41.667 --> 02:07:45.125
Mufti Mohammad wanted
everyone to know that

02:07:45.125 --> 02:07:47.167
the mummy is hidden
somewhere in this chamber.

02:07:47.458 --> 02:07:51.167
But before that he
wanted me to check it.

02:07:51.833 --> 02:07:55.292
Because if someone's found it
in all these years and shifted it

02:07:55.417 --> 02:07:58.917
then Mufti Mohammad
will be proved a liar.

02:07:59.208 --> 02:08:03.708
This is someone's last wish? Was
he a little bit of a nutcase?

02:08:03.708 --> 02:08:04.833
Leave that.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.458
We're standing under a
pyramid with our lives at stake,

02:08:09.458 --> 02:08:13.792
fulfilling that last wish
thousands of miles away from home.

02:08:13.875 --> 02:08:16.208
Let's not talk
about insanity now.

02:08:16.917 --> 02:08:20.292
Now do one thing. See that
wall? Step on its crevices and

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:23.792
climb the wall. Listen,

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.458
here, take this rope.

02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:32.292
Won't need it.

02:08:51.875 --> 02:08:56.042
The columns of pictures near
your head, those panels...

02:08:56.167 --> 02:09:00.792
press the fourth picture of
the second panel.

02:09:00.792 --> 02:09:01.958
Press it hard.

02:09:02.208 --> 02:09:04.958
Second panel.
Fourth picture.

02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:07.875
Harder.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.833
A bit harder.

02:09:11.708 --> 02:09:13.125
Nothing is happening.

02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:21.667
Okay come forward.

02:09:22.083 --> 02:09:25.167
Now put your foot there.

02:09:25.458 --> 02:09:28.250
Put your foot on the wall.

02:09:28.250 --> 02:09:32.667
Now do the same thing. Press
the second panel's fourth picture.

02:09:32.667 --> 02:09:35.125
Second panel. Fourth picture.-
- Do it.

02:09:36.125 --> 02:09:37.292
Harder.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.208
A little harder.
Press it a little harder.

02:09:59.292 --> 02:10:00.833
Go up.

02:10:01.667 --> 02:10:04.125
Go see what's in there.-
- Yes.

02:10:11.792 --> 02:10:13.708
Be careful, Shantu.

02:10:26.833 --> 02:10:28.583
Take out your torch.

02:10:29.042 --> 02:10:30.292
Yes.

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:34.875
See anything?

02:10:35.167 --> 02:10:36.917
Wait, let me check.

02:10:43.375 --> 02:10:45.708
Check properly.
Check the right side.

02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:50.458
Found anything?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.417
A normal coffin, Kakababu.

02:10:58.625 --> 02:10:59.417
Oh really?

02:10:59.542 --> 02:11:02.958
Check if there's an abnormal
mummy in that normal coffin.

02:11:02.958 --> 02:11:03.958
Sorry.

02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:05.125
Found it?

02:11:05.208 --> 02:11:06.208
Yes.

02:11:12.208 --> 02:11:14.958
Could you open it?-
- Wait a minute.

02:12:38.542 --> 02:12:39.750
Manto!

02:12:39.958 --> 02:12:41.583
Manto!

02:12:42.792 --> 02:12:46.083
Why did I have to tell him
about Hetepheres' tomb!

02:12:48.042 --> 02:12:50.167
How much did you buy him for?

02:12:51.958 --> 02:12:56.708
And why take the trouble,
you were getting half the booty.

02:12:56.708 --> 02:12:58.500
You Bengali dog...

02:12:58.917 --> 02:13:01.708
your job was to lead
me here. That's it.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.208
That's done.

02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:06.875
So I'm going to finish you
and your little puppy dog.

02:13:07.875 --> 02:13:08.875
Right here.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.083
Right now!

02:13:11.792 --> 02:13:13.500
Kakababu I'm coming down!

02:13:13.792 --> 02:13:16.667
Don't, Mr. Mamun is angry!-
- Careful!

02:13:16.958 --> 02:13:18.167
Stay there.

02:13:20.708 --> 02:13:21.875
Kakababu, careful!

02:13:27.333 --> 02:13:28.333
Move!

02:13:46.708 --> 02:13:50.125
Bengalis are not only
dogs, Mr.Mamun,

02:13:50.583 --> 02:13:52.042
they can be ringmasters too.

02:14:15.875 --> 02:14:16.958
Kakababu, be careful!

02:14:32.208 --> 02:14:34.333
First lever principle, sir.

02:14:35.250 --> 02:14:37.750
Thousands of years ago
probably this is how

02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:39.875
heavy rocks were lifted
in your country.

02:14:40.833 --> 02:14:43.792
The Humerus bone of your
forearm isn't that heavy though,

02:14:43.792 --> 02:14:47.125
that's quite evident from
your lack of humour.

02:14:47.667 --> 02:14:49.125
Are you alright?

02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:52.000
Yes, cut my hand that's it.

02:14:52.583 --> 02:14:53.917
Now go.

02:14:54.625 --> 02:14:56.292
Get the mummy's clothes.

02:14:56.667 --> 02:14:59.792
Let's complete Mr. Mamun's
fancy dress party!

02:15:00.208 --> 02:15:01.208
Come on now!

02:15:15.792 --> 02:15:17.083
You look quite cute!

02:15:18.042 --> 02:15:20.083
Now go get started at your job.

02:15:20.208 --> 02:15:23.292
I know it's difficult to
concentrate with such distractions.

02:15:23.458 --> 02:15:24.542
Come on now, go.

02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:38.750
Anything in there?-
- Yes.

02:15:39.542 --> 02:15:40.375
Wait.

02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:47.500
The mummy's in here Kakababu.

02:15:47.917 --> 02:15:49.750
But no treasure.
No weapons.

02:15:50.042 --> 02:15:51.292
Knew there won't be any.

02:15:51.708 --> 02:15:53.458
Baba Peer would've told
me if there was any.

02:15:54.667 --> 02:15:55.708
Nothing there...

02:15:56.375 --> 02:15:57.333
wait!

02:15:59.125 --> 02:16:00.083
A sandal.

02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:02.250
A sandal?

02:16:02.708 --> 02:16:04.708
Check if there are
any Hieroglyphics

02:16:04.708 --> 02:16:06.542
on the wall or the ceiling,

02:16:06.542 --> 02:16:11.542
or on that coffin?

02:16:12.083 --> 02:16:13.958
No. Nothing like that.

02:16:14.333 --> 02:16:17.000
Okay, open the coffin and see.

02:16:31.167 --> 02:16:32.458
Yes, Kakababu!

02:16:33.958 --> 02:16:35.875
There are some pictures
on the inner side of the lid.

02:16:36.042 --> 02:16:36.542
Good.

02:16:36.708 --> 02:16:39.042
Click those pictures
with your mobile.

02:16:39.833 --> 02:16:40.833
Get down after that,
we'll leave.

02:16:44.458 --> 02:16:47.583
Mr. Mamun, stay here
for a few days.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.083
Outside, I'll put a board
reading 'under renovation'.

02:16:51.083 --> 02:16:54.833
Till then stay here as
the Queen's guard.

02:16:56.250 --> 02:16:59.708
You'll understand the worth
of every moment here.

02:17:00.292 --> 02:17:03.917
You'll get to know how choking in
hunger and thirst every moment

02:17:04.167 --> 02:17:07.083
can make a living
mummy out of anyone.

02:17:08.917 --> 02:17:10.833
Now that's a death
worth dying, Mr. Mamun.

02:17:10.875 --> 02:17:12.708
Of pomp and grandeur.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:13.875
Isn't it?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.042
How many clicks, Snighda!
- Sis!

02:17:20.042 --> 02:17:21.458
What happened?

02:17:25.583 --> 02:17:27.667
You're fine?-
- Yes, I'm okay.

02:17:28.292 --> 02:17:29.292
Shantu!

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.625
Where's Raja?-
- Coming.

02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:33.125
He's fine!-
- Okay, come on now.

02:17:33.125 --> 02:17:34.292
You okay?-
- Yes.

02:17:34.292 --> 02:17:35.292
Now hurry!

02:17:36.083 --> 02:17:37.083
Hey!

02:17:37.125 --> 02:17:38.458
Where's Alkadi?-
- I don't know.

02:17:38.458 --> 02:17:40.042
This kid said the lame
man is on his way.

02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:42.250
Get him right now! He
is with the lame man.

02:17:42.250 --> 02:17:44.708
Right, sir.

02:17:46.042 --> 02:17:48.292
Come on. Quick. Run!

02:18:20.542 --> 02:18:21.542
Wow!

02:18:22.292 --> 02:18:25.708
The Pharaoh has come looking for the
Queen's belongings. Poetic justice.

02:18:25.833 --> 02:18:27.292
Found anything?

02:18:27.708 --> 02:18:29.792
No Alkadi, I'm
sorry to dissappoint you.

02:18:30.708 --> 02:18:33.417
The secret Mufti Mohammad
had asked me to keep was

02:18:33.542 --> 02:18:35.583
Queen Hetepheres'
mummy. But...

02:18:36.167 --> 02:18:39.167
we did not find money
or weapons there.

02:18:39.833 --> 02:18:40.958
Nothing?

02:18:41.583 --> 02:18:42.583
No.

02:18:42.583 --> 02:18:45.333
But it's true that I...-
- Run! Police!

02:18:46.125 --> 02:18:46.917
Thank you, Professor.

02:18:47.125 --> 02:18:49.250
You came this far to honour
your promise to Baba Peer.

02:18:50.917 --> 02:18:54.500
Take care, Alkadi. I'm going
back day after by Egypt Air.

02:18:55.542 --> 02:19:01.417
(song playing)

02:19:51.708 --> 02:19:52.750
Comrade!

02:19:53.917 --> 02:19:55.333
Long live the revolution!

02:19:57.208 --> 02:20:02.208
(song playing)

02:21:33.917 --> 02:21:35.333
Heard the man went mad?

02:21:35.333 --> 02:21:37.792
Yes, he was in a state of shock
when the police found him.

02:21:37.958 --> 02:21:41.375
He thought Raja had
really left him to rot there.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.958
Anyway, thanks for everything,
when do we meet again?

02:21:45.083 --> 02:21:47.500
Trying to work out a
transfer to Bangladesh next year.

02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:53.375
That'll be easier. Good if Rini can do
her college from Kolkata or Delhi.

02:21:53.583 --> 02:21:56.667
Though she wants to
stay here. Right?

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:59.625
Yes, right.-
- Will you remember?

02:22:00.625 --> 02:22:02.792
The Pharaoh Asemhet
the third's tomb.

02:22:03.542 --> 02:22:04.500
Third chamber.

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:08.625
Press the fifth picture
on the right hand side wall.

02:22:09.375 --> 02:22:11.000
Don't know what you'll find but

02:22:11.208 --> 02:22:15.917
that's what the pictures on the
Queen's sarcophagus indicate.

02:22:17.375 --> 02:22:19.042
I knew it, Professor,
all the way.

02:22:19.958 --> 02:22:22.625
Baba Peer can't send you so
far only to check a mummy.

02:22:23.125 --> 02:22:25.042
Thank you so much.-
- Well,

02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:28.625
If you really want to thank me,
can you promise me something?

02:22:29.667 --> 02:22:30.708
Sure, anything.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.333
Speaking from the experience of
63 years of democracy in our nation

02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:37.792
remain Hani Alkadi after
democracy returns to your nation.

02:22:38.208 --> 02:22:40.167
Don't turn into another
Jashne Mubarak.

02:22:42.833 --> 02:22:44.625
Where's Raja?-
- Yes, where is he?

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
There he is.

02:22:46.375 --> 02:22:49.208
He's speaking to a woman...

02:23:34.417 --> 02:23:36.417
Come on, we're getting late.

02:23:37.125 --> 02:23:38.667
What? Let's go!

02:23:38.875 --> 02:23:40.833
Shantu, let's go,
what's happening?

02:23:42.333 --> 02:23:43.333
Oh.

02:23:44.917 --> 02:23:47.167
Such things happen. What
is so...

02:23:47.625 --> 02:23:49.167
What's there to be so...

02:23:49.792 --> 02:23:51.208
'Hubba' in this?

02:23:54.250 --> 02:23:55.958
Hubba?-
- Hubba.

02:23:56.167 --> 02:23:58.750
Hubba! Yes, right, Hubba!

02:23:58.958 --> 02:24:01.042
Come on, we're getting late.

02:24:01.042 --> 02:24:04.250
You guys get Hubba so easily!

02:24:04.250 --> 02:24:06.875
- I'll take that.
- Come on let's go.

02:24:06.875 --> 02:24:09.792
Hubba is actually
an Egyptian word.

02:24:09.792 --> 02:24:13.250
Sometimes they say,
Al Hubba too.
