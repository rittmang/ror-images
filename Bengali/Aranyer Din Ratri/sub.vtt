00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.493
The people of Bengal be happy...

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:17.996
...not only at seeing seasons.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:21.000
But also at seeing death at face.

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:23.997
And also at seeing those
mountains gives me...

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:27.165
...happiness, why
is that so shocking?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.333
Is there anything about a Forest Bungalow
in there? Have a look.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.343
There is. But I wonder if such a
Bungalow exists today.

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:37.008
But without any plans, you could
have written a letter beforehand!

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:41.020
The animals are beautiful
only in forests.

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:43.022
And the children are
beautiful to mothers.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:44.022
Would you believe it...

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.975
Hey! Ask him for 20.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.972
Hey! 20 liters.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.976
Do it, Fast!

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:12.985
Hey! Is this Bihar?

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:14.987
He'll understand even if
you speak in Bengali.

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:16.989
O really!

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.995
Does this way go to
Phalamor? - Yes, sir.

00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:25.262
Is there any jungle
that way? - Yes, sir.

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:27.994
Muttering 'jungle, jungle',
you went that way!

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:32.002
Why has he been sleeping
all along?

00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:35.007
Because if he wakes up,
you'll start annoying him

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.015
Hari! Hari! Wake up! Wake up!

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:45.017
We have to push the vehicle.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.352
You!

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:54.026
Hey! What are you doing?

00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.358
This is a new shirt!

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.022
Hey! What's going on?

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.032
Leave him.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:08.973
Hey! Leave me. This the new
shirt, I bought recently.

00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:20.142
A sportsman can be so unsporting?

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.983
This is the first time I am
watching this kind of a thing.

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:25.989
Sanjay, we will reach
there within one hour?

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.493
Maximum by 3 o' clock.

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:31.326
It's because of you that we came,
you know? So that you get over 
your emotional wounds.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.994
Hey! Now you are blaming me.

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:36.330
Hey, whose idea was it to come
here in the first place?

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:37.495
I mean...

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:42.338
Listen. It was my idea that you
all have accepted.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.001
Nobody forced you.

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:45.510
Why will you force?

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.012
I have holidays. That's
the reason I came.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.014
And I will not get leave,
even if I want, so off sick.

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:50.344
And I'm unemployed.

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:52.009
Yes, now everything is solved.

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:53.177
Yes that may be solved

00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:56.017
But he is constantly
irritating me so much!

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.024
Don't mind that!

00:02:59.092 --> 00:03:01.117
When people come out of Kolkota...

00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:02.957
...they become younger.

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.963
Shekhar, have a look on your left.

00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:57.997
I didn't see in Palamar liquor
shops the culture...

00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:00.005
...that I saw in Bengal liquor shops.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.030
I have never seen Palamar
people ever get drunk

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:05.100
I can't even say that
there is no addiction...

00:06:05.178 --> 00:06:06.941
...and pride in their liquor.

00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:10.949
After the men taste it,
they become drunkards.

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:12.951
Male and female both
are consume alcohol.

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.953
It's a western society

00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:17.284
Will you listen to the
description of female?

00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:18.449
Yes.

00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:25.963
Everyone is black
and everyone young.

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:27.965
You mean eternal youth?!

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.965
Each one as one piece of cloth
attached to their body.

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.975
And every one has zero ornaments.

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.978
Hari, don't ever go out of the Bungalow.

00:06:47.487 --> 00:06:50.149
Listen, we're going to Kolkata by
Saturday right?

00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:52.987
Otherwise it'll be a disaster
for me, I'm telling you!

00:06:56.062 --> 00:06:57.996
Hari! Hari!

00:06:58.164 --> 00:06:59.324
What?

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.924
The girl which dumped you recently,

00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:03.935
Why didn't you retaliate?

00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:06.938
He plays with a straight bat.
Would he ever hit a woman?

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:09.941
Let him stay here for two days
alone, he'll end his ways.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.271
Is there no other topic to speak?

00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:14.939
You think that every person,
other than me, doesn't love.

00:07:15.014 --> 00:07:16.276
Sanjay does! Ask him first!

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.112
Hey!
- What 'hey'!

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:22.280
You don't have the guts
to speak about your love.

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.949
Everybody loves.

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:26.116
Not me.

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:27.284
You are not capable of it.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.454
Don't talk rubbish! I am not
interested in that Bourgeois stuff.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.963
It's Ok.

00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:34.966
I was saying that we are
asking you this...

00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:36.968
...because we are your friends.

00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:40.300
If it was necessary to push
then you should have pushed.

00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:41.465
I was the one who pushed.
Now, are you satisfied!

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:42.974
I'll not agree if you'll
not speak up.

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:45.977
You have to tell me the matter

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:47.307
What do you want to know?

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.972
What happened? What happened...

00:07:49.048 --> 00:07:50.310
...that you
changed so suddenly?

00:07:50.383 --> 00:07:51.975
You have to speak about it.

00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:53.985
Everything cannot be explained.

00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.315
Please don't force me.

00:07:55.388 --> 00:07:56.980
You have to speak about it.

00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:58.489
What are you doing? Please leave me.

00:07:58.558 --> 00:07:59.991
I'll not leave you.

00:08:03.997 --> 00:08:05.259
I'll how much strength you have.

00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:06.423
What kind of foolishness is this?

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:09.935
Speak up! Speak up!
You have to speak up.

00:08:10.003 --> 00:08:12.938
Leave me first, and
then I'll speak up.

00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:14.940
Ok, now tell me.

00:08:46.472 --> 00:08:47.962
This is...

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:51.306
This is the reply to my five page letter?

00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:57.973
Did you read my letter?
Did you understand it?

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:00.915
I doubt it.

00:09:02.989 --> 00:09:05.253
What's there in a letter?
I'm not one for letters.

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:08.089
Why did you write it?

00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:10.925
It was my responsibility...

00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:12.259
And I didn't write it giving
much thought to it.

00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:13.924
I wrote it just at a spur of the moment.

00:09:17.003 --> 00:09:20.939
And have I written that
I don't love you?

00:09:21.007 --> 00:09:22.269
No.

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:28.948
Anyway, please forgive me.

00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:32.901
I didn't say I am blameless.
But it's impossible...

00:09:32.902 --> 00:09:36.945
...to love a person who writes
this type of letters.

00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:38.957
I cannot lie, as there
is no benefit in it.

00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:40.959
How many days can it be maintained?

00:09:41.027 --> 00:09:42.961
And you should leave now.

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:48.968
I am late anyway, and it's not
right to suddenly come here like this

00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:10.489
Hey! Listen! Is there
any bungalow nearby?

00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:12.990
Forest, forest bungalow!

00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:16.995
Ask if he can come with us.

00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:20.997
Will you come with us? You
can show that place to us.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.004
You come and show and
I will give you a tip.

00:10:35.348 --> 00:10:37.009
Back side!

00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:38.345
Sanjay, give him some place.

00:10:38.418 --> 00:10:40.010
Or else it will be
difficult to drive.

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:34.005
Persons intending to use the
forest rest house must have...

00:11:34.073 --> 00:11:36.166
...permission of the D.F.O.,
Daltonganj.

00:12:02.035 --> 00:12:05.300
Here it is. The forest.

00:12:10.143 --> 00:12:11.974
Hello! Do you want me to
take down your luggage?

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:13.979
Hold on! Hold on!

00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:15.981
Gatekeeper! Hey, gatekeeper!

00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:17.983
I am calling him!

00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:23.315
Locked

00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:45.010
Babu! Gatekeeper!

00:12:45.078 --> 00:12:46.340
Are you the gatekeeper?
- Yes.

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:48.004
Open the doors. We are
going to stay here.

00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:50.012
Have you brought the letter?

00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:51.516
Haven't you got the letter?
- No, sir.

00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:53.017
What's the necessity of a letter?

00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:54.348
There are so many vacant rooms.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.012
Give us one and whatever money
is required I'll give it.

00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:58.023
Is there any reception here?

00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.286
I am not permitted to give you
the rooms without the slip.

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:01.951
What can we do if the letter
is not delivered?

00:13:02.028 --> 00:13:03.120
Open it fast.

00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:04.959
I may lose my job, sir.

00:13:05.031 --> 00:13:06.464
Who will take your job? D.F.O.!

00:13:06.532 --> 00:13:08.966
You please go to some
other bungalow.

00:13:09.035 --> 00:13:11.970
Do you understand the meaning
of V.I.P.? - No, sir.

00:13:12.038 --> 00:13:13.300
They are all VIPs.

00:13:13.372 --> 00:13:14.964
This person is a very big executive.

00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:17.976
This person is labor welfare
officer of jute.

00:13:18.044 --> 00:13:20.979
And he is a famous sportsman.

00:13:22.048 --> 00:13:23.310
I see.

00:13:27.053 --> 00:13:31.990
When we came here so far,
we can't go back.

00:13:32.058 --> 00:13:34.993
Take this and open the house.

00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:40.498
What are you thinking?

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:44.002
I'll tell DFO not to fire you.

00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:50.008
Thank God for corruption.
Go and open the door.

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:10.257
Hari, come. You and me in this room.

00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:28.977
Not bad!

00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:33.985
You have taken this bed?

00:14:39.492 --> 00:14:41.983
Over there is a dining room.

00:14:43.062 --> 00:14:44.996
Arrange something for dinner.

00:14:45.064 --> 00:14:46.998
Let's have a tea.

00:14:47.066 --> 00:14:48.158
Can we have a coffee?

00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:49.997
Coffee! Taking liberties!

00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:51.331
Gatekeeper!

00:14:51.404 --> 00:14:52.496
Sir!

00:14:56.075 --> 00:14:58.009
Can we have a tea?

00:14:58.177 --> 00:15:00.941
Tea! Ok, I'll make it, sir.

00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:02.944
What about the dinner?

00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:06.949
My wife is ill since four-five days.

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.953
Does you wife cook here?

00:15:10.022 --> 00:15:12.286
Sometimes, I too, cook.

00:15:12.358 --> 00:15:15.953
But now I don't have time to shop?

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:18.963
I'll do the shopping, sir.

00:15:19.031 --> 00:15:21.966
Can you cook, if somebody
brings all the requisites?

00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:24.468
Ok, I will do it.

00:15:26.305 --> 00:15:27.966
What's your name?

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.302
Lakha.

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:30.967
Lakha!

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:47.320
Sanjay, will you give me this blade.

00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:49.987
Why? Haven't you brought your blade?

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:51.986
I completely forgot it.

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:55.158
Give me.

00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:56.997
And tell me what else have
you forgotten completely?

00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:58.331
Only blade and nothing else.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:02.262
Why do you want to shave?
Who is watching you here?

00:16:09.015 --> 00:16:10.277
Sanjay, you?

00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:14.945
It's better not to do it. At least
we can conserve our energy.

00:16:17.123 --> 00:16:18.954
Hari! Hari!

00:16:19.292 --> 00:16:22.955
Hari! Wake up.

00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:26.965
Will you have a shave?

00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:28.964
No! Good!

00:16:32.038 --> 00:16:33.972
Good! All hippies.

00:17:29.028 --> 00:17:30.962
Without Shekhar, it's
not that much fun.

00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:34.965
Do you remember what
he has done in Digha?

00:17:35.034 --> 00:17:36.968
Yesterday when I called him,
do you know what said?

00:17:37.036 --> 00:17:38.298
What?

00:17:38.371 --> 00:17:40.134
He said that I was informing
in the last moment...

00:17:40.206 --> 00:17:41.969
...how can he get the
leave from his workplace.

00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:43.972
In the end, turns out
he doesn't have a job!

00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:59.985
Hey! What are you looking
at? Go away!

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:11.936
There is such a sweet
music in this sound.

00:18:13.272 --> 00:18:15.934
Really! Visiting this place
increases our longevity.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:23.942
Perhaps there is need to
increase longevity beforehand...

00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:25.278
Why?

00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:26.943
You're on the ascending curve.

00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:29.283
The longer you live, the
more you will rise.

00:18:32.124 --> 00:18:34.957
The more I rise, the
more I will fall.

00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:45.299
Do you remember our days earlier?

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:47.966
Yes! I was thinking about
it sometime ago.

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.975
How much we used to work!

00:18:51.043 --> 00:18:53.978
Unimaginable! 16 hours a day.

00:18:55.147 --> 00:19:00.084
There is less work in the day job now,
most work is towards people

00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:05.249
But one thing is for sure that
those days were not that bad.

00:19:08.994 --> 00:19:10.928
Did you have your bath?

00:19:11.263 --> 00:19:12.924
First class.

00:19:12.998 --> 00:19:14.932
Would you like to watch a thing?

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.931
Do whatever you wish

00:19:27.112 --> 00:19:29.945
All ties with civilisation are cut.

00:19:32.017 --> 00:19:33.951
I was thinking of using it to wrap
our shoes in on the way back.

00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:48.122
Hey! Did you sleep well?

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.966
Don't ask me! There's was
something which was...

00:19:52.037 --> 00:19:53.971
...constantly disturbing over there.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:55.973
Really!
- Yes.

00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:59.975
Was that sound, really
that irritating?

00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:02.980
You don't believe me? Go
and check it by yourself.

00:20:26.071 --> 00:20:29.336
Hari! You do one thing. Become Tarzan!

00:20:37.082 --> 00:20:39.016
Be careful, if the elephant
comes here.

00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:46.180
Tell me where are we heading,
do have any destination or goal...

00:20:46.258 --> 00:20:51.025
then again how many people became
rich by having goals?

00:20:51.096 --> 00:20:54.031
Don't talk and follow me.

00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:56.033
Ok, boss.

00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:05.975
Sunset! Have you seen
a sunset like this?

00:21:06.045 --> 00:21:07.307
Yes, in Kolkata for sure.

00:21:07.379 --> 00:21:08.971
But in what western?

00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:10.996
That Burt Lancaster film.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.170
You go sit down. I'm coming.

00:21:45.084 --> 00:21:47.018
Are they all riff raff?

00:21:47.086 --> 00:21:49.020
They're not going to do
anything are they?

00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:51.022
If they do anything,
then you do something back.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.024
Come here and sit.

00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:01.294
Give me a glass.

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:10.973
Take this, grams and papad.

00:22:11.043 --> 00:22:12.977
Is it strong?

00:22:14.046 --> 00:22:15.138
Taste it yourself, my dear friend.

00:22:15.214 --> 00:22:18.308
No. I don't like anything
except imported scotch.

00:22:18.384 --> 00:22:19.476
Hey!

00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:22.984
Shine that light here!

00:22:25.057 --> 00:22:26.991
Not that much.
- Shut up!

00:22:30.062 --> 00:22:31.324
Is it Ok?

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:56.020
What a life!

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:20.978
Sir! - Who?

00:23:22.047 --> 00:23:23.981
It's you.

00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:25.983
I want some too sir.

00:23:26.318 --> 00:23:28.149
What are you doing here?
Didn't you go to the market?

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.482
Yes, sir. I went there.

00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:31.989
I bought the chicken and sent
it to the gatekeeper.

00:23:32.157 --> 00:23:33.988
Where's the rest of the money?

00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:37.992
Bring it here.

00:23:38.063 --> 00:23:39.325
Yes, sir.

00:23:44.336 --> 00:23:46.327
Who knows how much you're
short changing me.

00:23:48.507 --> 00:23:52.341
Take this! Go!

00:23:59.084 --> 00:24:00.949
What a life!

00:24:07.292 --> 00:24:09.954
Hari! O Hari!

00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:11.290
Yes.

00:24:11.463 --> 00:24:12.953
Look behind!

00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:15.464
What's there?

00:24:15.534 --> 00:24:18.970
Just have a look!

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.972
Miss India! Isn't she nice?

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.985
Enough. Don't look in that manner.

00:25:13.025 --> 00:25:16.961
The more one rises, the
more one falls.

00:25:34.313 --> 00:25:36.975
What? Sanju!

00:25:37.049 --> 00:25:41.986
Are you comparing Sanjeev
Chatterjee with vandhana?

00:25:42.154 --> 00:25:44.987
What a history you have?

00:25:45.157 --> 00:25:49.150
You consume liquor and your
boss, consume it too.

00:25:49.228 --> 00:25:51.321
If you'll not take it, you cannot
survive at your work.

00:25:51.396 --> 00:25:52.988
Do you think that I don't know it?

00:26:02.274 --> 00:26:05.266
If I leave this job, will
you give a new job?

00:26:05.344 --> 00:26:07.278
Why should you leave it?

00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:08.938
Why should I leave!

00:26:09.014 --> 00:26:12.950
Your boss has a daughter
right? Compensation!

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:17.955
Boss's daughter spends
bloody hours with the boyfriend...

00:26:19.024 --> 00:26:20.457
You are saying that...

00:26:20.525 --> 00:26:22.334
...she didn't let you hold her hand, huh?

00:26:36.308 --> 00:26:38.299
Why would I leave it?

00:26:40.045 --> 00:26:46.314
There are thousand to leave
that job, but I can't.

00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:49.981
If I leave that job, then
what will I feed my family.

00:26:51.056 --> 00:26:55.993
My father, mother, younger brother.

00:26:58.063 --> 00:27:00.930
Don't bother falling in love.

00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:05.263
I'll talk to your parents to
find a good match for you.

00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:07.931
To see a good girl for you.

00:27:08.006 --> 00:27:09.940
You need not bother about that.

00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:15.944
That means they've already found one!

00:27:16.114 --> 00:27:19.948
You are here only for
a certain purpose.

00:27:20.018 --> 00:27:21.952
You will go to work.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.954
You will bear sunlight.

00:27:24.022 --> 00:27:25.956
Make a home with your wife.

00:27:26.124 --> 00:27:31.960
And you will be a cent
percent Bengali...

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:37.969
...middle-class conventional
good boy.

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:44.972
Sir!

00:27:46.044 --> 00:27:47.306
Sir!

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:49.973
Somebody is calling.

00:27:50.048 --> 00:27:51.982
Give me some.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.983
Give her what she wants.

00:27:56.054 --> 00:27:57.988
Hari! Hari!

00:27:58.156 --> 00:27:59.987
What are you doing?

00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:02.916
Listen, she wants something.

00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:04.929
Who?
- Sir.

00:28:06.999 --> 00:28:11.936
Give me some, sir.

00:28:12.004 --> 00:28:13.938
Half-quarter!

00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:21.272
You want to drink more?

00:28:26.284 --> 00:28:27.945
What's your name?

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.954
Miss India.
- Shut up!

00:28:31.289 --> 00:28:32.950
What's your name?

00:28:35.627 --> 00:28:36.958
What's your name?

00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:40.293
Dulli.

00:28:49.041 --> 00:28:50.303
Half-quarter.

00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:54.971
Can you dance?

00:28:56.148 --> 00:28:57.979
Like this.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:04.922
I went there and danced
and got there 500 rupees.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.923
500 rupees!

00:29:09.094 --> 00:29:12.928
Yes, that sir gave me 500 rupees.

00:29:12.998 --> 00:29:15.933
I'll give you twenty five

00:29:20.005 --> 00:29:21.939
Hey! You pig!

00:29:23.008 --> 00:29:27.945
You are trying to pick my pocket.

00:29:28.013 --> 00:29:29.947
Hey! What's going on there!

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:38.954
O God, what all this?
- Shut up!

00:29:42.027 --> 00:29:46.964
Take this and drink
as much as you want.

00:29:47.132 --> 00:29:49.965
Hey, you are a thief.

00:30:19.498 --> 00:30:23.992
Hey, Hari! Control yourself.

00:30:24.069 --> 00:30:25.161
Control yourself Mr. Devdas.

00:30:26.071 --> 00:30:27.333
Haven't you read about Sharat
Chandra's 'Devdas'.

00:30:27.405 --> 00:30:28.497
No. I didn't.

00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:38.345
Do you know cricket
ruined my education?

00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:40.008
Ok. Ok.

00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:58.032
The tea is here, sir.

00:30:58.537 --> 00:31:00.971
The tea is here, sir.

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:02.973
Keep it there.

00:31:37.075 --> 00:31:40.010
Sanjay, wake up.

00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:44.014
There is some fantastic
news. Sari and slacks.

00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:45.174
Where?

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.013
I just saw them outside the
house through the window.

00:31:47.085 --> 00:31:50.020
Don't tell me about
that fantastic thing.

00:31:54.526 --> 00:31:56.357
Hey! What are you doing there?

00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:01.965
What's this? Here there is only tea.

00:32:05.036 --> 00:32:06.970
Gatekeeper!

00:32:11.042 --> 00:32:12.976
Didn't you get some
eggs or something?

00:32:13.044 --> 00:32:17.981
Sir, my wife is ill and
I took her to the doctor.

00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:21.985
And where was the time
to bring the eggs.

00:32:23.054 --> 00:32:24.988
Ask him to bring the eggs.

00:32:25.056 --> 00:32:26.318
He'll starve us to death.

00:32:26.391 --> 00:32:27.983
Without eggs, it won't do.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.491
Who? Lakha.

00:32:30.562 --> 00:32:32.325
He is asking us to go to the market.

00:32:32.397 --> 00:32:35.992
It is such a tragedy that
there are no eggs here.

00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:38.001
What is this? What are you doing?

00:32:38.069 --> 00:32:40.003
Why are you getting ready so early?

00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:42.164
Today, in the morning he
saw a couple of women.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.003
Not santhals (a tribe).

00:33:03.128 --> 00:33:04.288
I will bring the eggs, sir.

00:33:04.362 --> 00:33:05.454
Will you?
- Yes.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.963
Where will you get them?
- They are available there.

00:33:07.132 --> 00:33:08.963
We can get them boiled here.

00:33:09.034 --> 00:33:11.298
Bring 8 eggs.

00:33:12.037 --> 00:33:13.299
Hey! Somebody order the tea.

00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:14.463
Ok, order him.

00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:18.976
Serve the tea, here! Make
it with buffalo milk.

00:33:20.312 --> 00:33:21.973
With buffalo milk!

00:33:29.054 --> 00:33:30.316
Hey!

00:33:31.056 --> 00:33:33.991
Don't give that hungry look.
They will mind.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.994
Why are they all sitting there?

00:33:37.062 --> 00:33:38.324
To sell.

00:33:38.396 --> 00:33:41.991
Do you want to buy?

00:33:42.167 --> 00:33:45.330
No. You go there, if you want
to get scolded by them.

00:33:51.343 --> 00:33:54.005
Hey! Why are you all sitting here?

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:57.014
So what if we're sitting here?
It's none of your business!

00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:07.287
What happen, Mr Sharat Chandra?
- She got angry, suddenly.

00:34:07.359 --> 00:34:09.953
It was funny.
- What about the tea?

00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:13.461
Actually they sell corn?

00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:15.965
Right now they are out of work.

00:34:17.035 --> 00:34:19.128
They don't have work and
they are laughing.

00:34:19.204 --> 00:34:20.967
Really, peculiar!

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:25.976
Sir, will you give me work?

00:34:27.645 --> 00:34:29.977
Yes, we will, in the bungalow.

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:32.980
And what was that.

00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:34.985
Just like that.

00:34:41.493 --> 00:34:42.983
Sir, eggs!

00:34:43.495 --> 00:34:44.985
Here they are!

00:34:47.165 --> 00:34:48.496
Lakha!

00:34:50.068 --> 00:34:54.004
Do any daughters of
gentlemen live here?

00:34:54.072 --> 00:34:56.165
Not living, sir. They have come here.
- Know where they're staying?

00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:59.335
Yes. They are in that direction.

00:35:08.286 --> 00:35:10.948
Oh! The sun's in my eyes here.

00:35:14.292 --> 00:35:17.955
Sister-in-law, have a look behind
yourself, in the left.

00:35:26.037 --> 00:35:27.971
Will you stay here or leave?

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.974
What are your plans?

00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:34.978
Let's introduce ourselves.

00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:38.982
This is not Kolkata, why
these formalities?

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.984
We will definitely not
leave you alone.

00:35:43.054 --> 00:35:44.988
I am not with you.

00:35:46.324 --> 00:35:49.987
Hari!
- Leave him.

00:35:58.169 --> 00:36:01.263
Now we have to stop the game.
- Yes, I guess.

00:36:08.012 --> 00:36:09.946
What?
- What?

00:36:10.114 --> 00:36:11.445
We are waiting.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.932
Show us your technique

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:16.950
Who are you?

00:36:17.021 --> 00:36:18.283
Who are you?

00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:19.948
Who are you?

00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:23.960
We are human beings.

00:36:24.028 --> 00:36:25.962
Good thing you said so.

00:36:42.046 --> 00:36:45.982
We are from Kolkata.
- O I see. Tourists?

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.315
Sort of. Is this you house?

00:36:49.387 --> 00:36:52.481
Yes. I saw you from
a long distance and...

00:36:52.557 --> 00:36:55.321
...was wondering that who is
wandering in front of my home.

00:36:55.493 --> 00:36:57.984
We were just admiring your cottage.

00:36:58.162 --> 00:36:59.993
Fantastic!

00:37:00.098 --> 00:37:02.259
Then why are you standing outside.

00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:05.928
Please come in, if you not busy.

00:37:06.004 --> 00:37:07.938
No. We are not busy.

00:37:08.006 --> 00:37:09.940
Then please come in.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.941
What's your name?

00:37:14.279 --> 00:37:16.941
His good name is Anind Mukherjee.

00:37:17.015 --> 00:37:18.949
And what's your pet name, grandpa?

00:37:19.017 --> 00:37:23.283
No. I don't have any pet name.

00:37:23.354 --> 00:37:26.949
His pet name is Tublu Babu.

00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:28.959
Where will we go tomorrow, granpa?

00:37:29.027 --> 00:37:30.961
Circus!
- Circus?

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.966
Yes. The matter is that some
years ago many animals...

00:37:36.034 --> 00:37:37.968
...used to come nearby our house.

00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:39.970
But now, there are not many,
wandering around.

00:37:40.038 --> 00:37:42.973
That's the reason we are
going to the circus...

00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:44.975
...which is going to happen tomorrow.

00:37:46.044 --> 00:37:47.978
Let me introduce you.

00:37:48.046 --> 00:37:52.983
She is my daughter-in-law,
and she is my daughter.

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:57.977
And I am Sadashiv Tripathi.

00:37:58.056 --> 00:37:59.990
My name is Shekhar Sen.

00:38:00.015 --> 00:38:01.158
I'm Asim Chatterjee

00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:02.251
And I am Sanjay Banerjee.

00:38:02.327 --> 00:38:03.419
Splendid!

00:38:03.528 --> 00:38:05.928
There was one more person
with you. Right?

00:38:05.997 --> 00:38:07.259
Is it so!

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:10.932
He's gone to look at the church.
Sanjay go and call him.

00:38:13.004 --> 00:38:15.939
Come. You too come here.

00:38:18.009 --> 00:38:21.945
Sit wherever you want to.
Make yourself comfortable.

00:38:27.118 --> 00:38:28.278
You sit here.

00:38:28.353 --> 00:38:29.945
It's Ok.

00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:34.952
Where are you staying here?
- Forest bungalow.

00:38:35.026 --> 00:38:36.960
O god! What are you doing?

00:38:37.028 --> 00:38:38.962
There's no other place except that.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.963
Just in the morning we
were around that place.

00:38:42.033 --> 00:38:43.125
Really!

00:38:43.201 --> 00:38:44.964
You place is very beautiful.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.301
It looks like some foreign
tourist site.

00:38:47.372 --> 00:38:48.964
Have you been there?

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.302
He has seen it in the movies.

00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:51.967
I too have seen in the movies.

00:38:54.045 --> 00:38:55.137
They are here!

00:38:55.213 --> 00:38:56.976
He's the best sportsman among us.

00:38:57.148 --> 00:38:59.309
O my God!

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.924
Have you seen church here?

00:39:08.993 --> 00:39:14.932
The church! Haven't you seen
the church? How was it?

00:39:15.099 --> 00:39:17.932
O yes. It was good.

00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:22.939
Actually, he's not getting news of
the test match, that's why he's a bit down.

00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:25.942
Rini, you were listening
to the radio, right!

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.443
206 for 3!

00:39:27.512 --> 00:39:30.948
West Indies are batting?

00:39:31.015 --> 00:39:32.277
Yes.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.944
Do you listen to that too?

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:37.954
Till today, I am unable
to find out...

00:39:38.022 --> 00:39:39.956
...what your interests really are!

00:39:40.024 --> 00:39:41.958
I myself don't know
father what they are.

00:39:42.026 --> 00:39:43.960
That why you can feel safe.

00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:45.956
Do you play badminton?

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.961
Mixed doubles!

00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:50.466
What do you say?

00:39:50.535 --> 00:39:52.127
Mixed doubles? But there's
already four of you.

00:39:52.203 --> 00:39:53.966
I am out of practice for 10 years.

00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:58.973
If you all play, I can play too...

00:39:59.043 --> 00:40:00.977
...but with whom should be I paired.

00:40:01.045 --> 00:40:02.979
I am the weakest.

00:40:03.047 --> 00:40:05.982
Ok! Ok! You and me and
Shekhar and Hari.

00:40:10.488 --> 00:40:13.980
What's that? It looks
very interesting.

00:40:17.061 --> 00:40:23.990
That! There is a small house
which has a small balcony.

00:40:24.068 --> 00:40:27.003
Long time ago I used to sit there
and observe the animals.

00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:29.005
But since they are not
visible here now...

00:40:29.073 --> 00:40:31.007
...that's why my daughter
has captured it.

00:40:31.175 --> 00:40:33.006
Do you stay there?

00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:35.011
Not at night.

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:38.014
There she does meditation.

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:40.016
Because of dad.

00:40:40.084 --> 00:40:44.020
What should I do? You make
here everybody silent.

00:40:44.088 --> 00:40:46.022
Can I see the place?

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.352
Ask my daughter?

00:40:48.092 --> 00:40:51.027
Are you doing some
forage over there?

00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:52.357
You will find it if you will see it.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.522
Let's go.

00:41:05.042 --> 00:41:07.977
I still can't believe that one
can live here so happily.

00:41:09.046 --> 00:41:10.980
Have you been here earlier?

00:41:11.048 --> 00:41:12.310
No.

00:41:12.383 --> 00:41:17.277
I meant to come to Palamar, but
coming here was more of an accident

00:41:17.302 --> 00:41:19.302
But you could say it was a
happy accident...

00:41:20.158 --> 00:41:22.319
How did you get the bungalow?

00:41:25.163 --> 00:41:26.994
There was no reservation I take it?

00:41:27.064 --> 00:41:28.998
Naturally not.

00:41:30.168 --> 00:41:31.999
Is there no other way?

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.163
Looking at you one doesn't get
a feeling you're that innocent

00:41:37.074 --> 00:41:38.336
Come.

00:41:38.509 --> 00:41:39.999
You first.

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:48.018
We were at that bungalow earlier.
We came as a big group.

00:41:48.085 --> 00:41:49.177
You were there?

00:41:49.253 --> 00:41:53.019
Yes. At that time I thought
the gatekeeper was rather honest.

00:42:03.535 --> 00:42:05.469
Just for one person?

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.016
No. You can't be understood clearly.

00:42:54.085 --> 00:42:56.019
Is that very important?

00:42:56.354 --> 00:42:58.015
Not immediately.

00:43:05.029 --> 00:43:06.963
Wow!

00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:11.297
You could call it an observation balcony.
At least that's what my father calls it.

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:14.217
Are there any animals here?

00:43:14.242 --> 00:43:16.139
I've seen deer.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.301
Far away over there.

00:43:18.476 --> 00:43:20.967
It was a long time ago however.

00:43:22.146 --> 00:43:25.309
Then why shouldn't it be
called Juliet's balcony now?

00:43:26.317 --> 00:43:28.979
Say, over there someone says...

00:43:29.053 --> 00:43:31.988
...it is the east and
Juliet is the sun.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.980
Will you say this?

00:43:34.492 --> 00:43:36.983
Would that be wrong?

00:43:37.061 --> 00:43:39.996
At night there are plenty
of foxes around.

00:43:43.334 --> 00:43:45.996
If you discourage me like that
then it's difficult to say

00:43:50.174 --> 00:43:52.005
Are you done with seeing the room?

00:44:00.017 --> 00:44:04.954
I feel like pinching you.
To see if you are real.

00:44:05.022 --> 00:44:06.956
First have some of this.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.961
Do you stay here alone all day?

00:44:15.032 --> 00:44:16.966
My sister-in-law comes
here sometimes.

00:44:18.495 --> 00:44:20.495
To disturb your meditation?

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.974
Do you come here every year?

00:44:25.042 --> 00:44:30.981
Around once a year. My likes
this place very much.

00:44:31.582 --> 00:44:32.981
And you?

00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:34.978
I too like it.

00:44:38.055 --> 00:44:39.989
And your mom...

00:44:41.058 --> 00:44:43.993
She has passed away. My brother too.

00:44:45.062 --> 00:44:47.997
That means your sister-in-law...

00:44:48.022 --> 00:44:50.022
I had only one brother.

00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:53.000
Rini, have you shown him the house?
- Yes!

00:44:55.072 --> 00:44:58.007
Your name is Rini?

00:44:58.075 --> 00:45:00.009
It's my pet name.

00:45:00.034 --> 00:45:02.034
And real name?

00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:03.446
Aparna

00:45:03.447 --> 00:45:06.939
Have you seen it?
- Great.

00:45:07.018 --> 00:45:08.952
If you sell it anytime, I'll buy it.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.954
In the meantime I'm jealous of
your daughter.
- Is that so?

00:45:13.024 --> 00:45:14.958
Sir!
- What!

00:45:15.026 --> 00:45:16.960
Will you come to the bungalow?

00:45:17.028 --> 00:45:18.290
What's the matter?

00:45:18.362 --> 00:45:20.956
Somebody came for you.

00:45:21.032 --> 00:45:22.966
Ok. We will be there in a moment.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.961
Are you leaving?

00:45:25.136 --> 00:45:27.297
We are residing nearby, we'll
come visit you sometime later.

00:45:27.371 --> 00:45:28.963
You have to!

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.974
And you invite them to
visit here sometime.

00:45:31.042 --> 00:45:33.977
Please come anytime,
we are always free.

00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:35.979
But we are going to Ranchi.

00:45:36.047 --> 00:45:39.983
Yes, I forgot. We are
going to Ranchi.

00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:41.985
There's my aunty's sister.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.982
Are you leaving today?

00:45:46.057 --> 00:45:47.991
Yes, we are leaving at afternoon...

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:49.321
...and return here by night.

00:45:49.493 --> 00:45:52.985
Why don't you people come
here tomorrow morning!

00:45:53.064 --> 00:45:54.998
We'll have breakfast here and
then we can play badminton.

00:45:55.066 --> 00:45:56.499
Will there be eggs?

00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:58.000
Yes, definitely.

00:46:05.009 --> 00:46:06.943
Are you...

00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:08.945
Yes, we are staying here.

00:46:10.014 --> 00:46:11.948
Four!
- Yes, four.

00:46:12.016 --> 00:46:13.278
Are you ranger?

00:46:14.285 --> 00:46:15.946
Your Bungalow is great.

00:46:17.021 --> 00:46:18.283
It's fantastic!

00:46:18.355 --> 00:46:21.290
I am thinking of giving
it a wide publicity.

00:46:21.358 --> 00:46:22.950
As you wish.

00:46:23.027 --> 00:46:27.964
But the way you have
occupied this is not...

00:46:28.032 --> 00:46:29.966
We can understand.

00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:37.133
Staying here without authorization
is against the...

00:46:37.208 --> 00:46:39.301
Principle! That's what
is written there.

00:46:39.376 --> 00:46:41.139
Even if the bungalow is empty...

00:46:41.212 --> 00:46:43.976
It makes no...

00:46:44.048 --> 00:46:46.983
Difference!
- No, no.

00:46:50.154 --> 00:46:54.147
As we came here so far, and
as we like the place...

00:46:54.225 --> 00:46:56.989
...we'll be staying
here for some time.

00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:58.995
Duration?

00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:02.261
Four or five days.

00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:05.928
By Saturday, we have to go
to Kolkata, there is a race.

00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:12.102
And apart from the jungle...

00:47:12.176 --> 00:47:13.939
...there is another attraction.

00:47:15.012 --> 00:47:17.947
Additional!
- Bonus!

00:47:18.115 --> 00:47:21.107
Now, tell me is there
any possibility of...

00:47:21.185 --> 00:47:24.951
...somebody coming here
by the time we leave.

00:47:25.022 --> 00:47:28.958
Our sir will be coming here.
Conservator himself.

00:47:30.027 --> 00:47:31.961
What's this? You mean
within two-three days?

00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:35.965
And the gatekeeper will
definitely be sacked.

00:47:36.033 --> 00:47:37.295
What are you saying?

00:47:39.303 --> 00:47:42.295
If we speak to him,
can't we convince him?

00:47:42.373 --> 00:47:46.969
You can try, but it depends on...

00:47:47.044 --> 00:47:49.979
On his mood!
- Yes.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.987
You stay here.

00:48:01.992 --> 00:48:04.256
But if our sir comes here
and if he wants to stay...

00:48:04.328 --> 00:48:07.422
...then you have to evacuate.

00:48:19.009 --> 00:48:20.943
He took away your cigarette
'Gold Flake'.

00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:23.946
Everything was fine and
he came and ruined it.

00:48:24.014 --> 00:48:25.948
Leave it.

00:48:26.016 --> 00:48:28.951
This place is not conservative's
own property.

00:48:29.019 --> 00:48:30.452
Yes, right!

00:48:47.137 --> 00:48:49.298
Hari! Hari!

00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:57.303
The sister-in-law is a widow.

00:48:57.381 --> 00:48:58.973
Really!

00:48:59.984 --> 00:49:03.920
But the way she is, it's
hard to find that out.

00:49:09.426 --> 00:49:13.920
And what, you are 10 years
out of practice?

00:49:13.998 --> 00:49:15.932
You made them a fool.

00:49:17.268 --> 00:49:18.929
How far has the things
gone with her?

00:49:25.009 --> 00:49:26.943
My body's become so dry.

00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:30.947
I have to take a bath with oils.

00:49:31.015 --> 00:49:32.949
Chapped lips...

00:49:32.974 --> 00:49:35.648
What are you doing?
That's for hair!

00:49:39.023 --> 00:49:41.958
Shekhar, I guess from now on
we should take your words seriously?

00:49:42.293 --> 00:49:45.956
That would be the safe option,
else you'll look foolish.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:47.964
Sir!

00:49:52.036 --> 00:49:53.970
Sir, will you give us work?

00:49:55.373 --> 00:49:57.373
They are here.

00:50:00.144 --> 00:50:01.975
What can you do?

00:50:02.146 --> 00:50:03.977
We can do everything.

00:50:04.148 --> 00:50:06.309
We will clean the house,
wash the clothes...

00:50:06.383 --> 00:50:07.975
...and we will bring the
drinking water for you.

00:50:08.152 --> 00:50:09.983
You have to give the job
to all of us three.

00:50:10.154 --> 00:50:11.985
And you have to give
2 rupees each daily.

00:50:12.056 --> 00:50:13.318
Is it so?

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.004
We got the workers.

00:50:28.072 --> 00:50:30.006
What? What's the matter?

00:50:33.177 --> 00:50:35.008
What do you say?

00:50:37.081 --> 00:50:39.015
That's why we brought him along.

00:50:43.354 --> 00:50:46.016
Do this.

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.352
Done.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.302
Did you pay them in advance?

00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:06.969
Yes, mutual benefit.

00:51:07.144 --> 00:51:10.978
She will clean the house.

00:51:12.132 --> 00:51:14.051
I'll take the filter tip.

00:51:14.051 --> 00:51:15.313
Filter tip!

00:51:38.075 --> 00:51:42.011
Didn't you have a very
stylish transistor radio?

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.013
Yes, Japanese.
- Yes Japanese.

00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:47.016
It was shaped like a bottle right?

00:51:47.184 --> 00:51:53.020
I'm wondering about news of Kolkata,
and what's going on there?

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.183
I had the same idea...

00:51:55.259 --> 00:51:58.023
...but in the rush I forgot
to bring it.

00:52:06.036 --> 00:52:10.973
In optical goods, they say
they have surpassed Germany.

00:52:11.141 --> 00:52:12.972
Why? What about electronic goods?

00:52:13.143 --> 00:52:16.977
Can't believe it, they'll put
a television in a watch next.

00:52:23.775 --> 00:52:27.150
But they can't develop things
like atom bombs.

00:52:27.175 --> 00:52:30.995
Who would think, after Hiroshima,
a race would stand up like this?

00:52:32.229 --> 00:52:35.995
Look now, eastern country!
Land of the rising sun!

00:52:36.066 --> 00:52:38.000
Yes the Japanese are great...

00:52:38.068 --> 00:52:41.003
Hey! Go away. Run.

00:52:45.509 --> 00:52:47.340
Hey! Go away. Run.

00:52:47.411 --> 00:52:50.175
Hey what are you doing?
I hired them?

00:52:50.247 --> 00:52:52.340
They are very bad women.

00:52:52.416 --> 00:52:53.508
No, they are not.

00:52:53.584 --> 00:52:55.176
It's question of my job. Sir.

00:52:55.252 --> 00:52:57.015
What are you saying!

00:52:57.087 --> 00:52:59.021
It's question of my job. Sir.

00:52:59.089 --> 00:53:00.113
But I have already paid them.

00:53:02.025 --> 00:53:03.287
I can't do it.

00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:28.984
Lakha!
- Sir.

00:53:29.319 --> 00:53:31.981
Have you entered the room
when I was not here?

00:53:32.055 --> 00:53:33.989
No, sir. I was cleaning the car.

00:53:34.057 --> 00:53:36.321
Cleaning the car? If so
then where is my purse?

00:53:36.393 --> 00:53:37.485
How will I know?

00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:40.155
How will you know! I'll
give you one punch, you idiot.

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:41.322
Haven't you entered the room,
after I was gone!

00:53:41.398 --> 00:53:42.490
Hey! Have you checked it well?

00:53:42.566 --> 00:53:43.999
Yes, definitely, would I
say so otherwise?

00:53:45.068 --> 00:53:47.002
I haven't gone anywhere
else sir!

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.001
Ok, then I will search you.

00:53:49.172 --> 00:53:51.003
Sir, please don't touch me.

00:53:51.074 --> 00:53:55.010
Hey! What happened?
Have you gone mad!

00:53:55.345 --> 00:53:57.006
No, sir. I'll not work here anymore.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.015
You bloody, you have stolen
and behaving innocent.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.284
No, sir. I'll not work here any
more. Pay me, and I'll leave.

00:54:05.355 --> 00:54:06.947
Lakha!

00:54:10.127 --> 00:54:14.291
Take this and leave.

00:54:22.306 --> 00:54:25.298
Hari Das needs a nerve tonic.

00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:30.974
It's really difficult.
The water is very low.

00:54:31.048 --> 00:54:34.313
He lost a monthly ticket
and some money.

00:54:36.153 --> 00:54:37.984
Though this not the first
time he lost something.

00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:43.993
One day, I really bullied
him for this habit of his...

00:54:48.065 --> 00:54:49.999
Hey! What are you doing here?

00:54:50.167 --> 00:54:53.000
I couldn't resist.

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.334
The water's something!
Ice cold!

00:54:56.073 --> 00:54:58.007
We drink this same water right?

00:55:14.625 --> 00:55:16.957
Will you not put oil on your body?

00:55:17.027 --> 00:55:18.961
I'm not into that "natives" oil thing.

00:55:21.298 --> 00:55:22.959
Where's Hari?

00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:25.294
He has fallen in love with Dulli.

00:55:25.369 --> 00:55:26.461
Really!

00:55:26.536 --> 00:55:27.969
It's not surprising.

00:55:28.038 --> 00:55:30.973
If you will appoint
his lover as a maid...

00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:32.303
...he's bound to get angry.

00:55:32.376 --> 00:55:33.468
What soap is this?

00:55:33.543 --> 00:55:35.977
It's imported.
- Really! It's scented.

00:55:38.048 --> 00:55:40.983
When I make my own home,
I'll have a well.

00:55:41.051 --> 00:55:42.985
Good thing we had a bath here!

00:55:46.156 --> 00:55:48.317
Is that the return of the ranger?

00:56:00.437 --> 00:56:02.928
Has any of you, lost your wallet?

00:56:04.274 --> 00:56:06.936
Are you bathing?

00:56:15.018 --> 00:56:18.954
It was in our badminton court.

00:56:19.022 --> 00:56:20.284
So kind of you.

00:56:20.357 --> 00:56:22.120
And take this. This will keep
you updated with the score.

00:56:22.192 --> 00:56:24.285
You kind of you.

00:56:24.361 --> 00:56:26.955
That's most our radio!

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.964
Do you remember when to come
tomorrow for breakfast?

00:56:29.032 --> 00:56:30.966
8:30 sharp.

00:56:32.035 --> 00:56:34.970
Ok, then. We are leaving. Let's go.

00:56:43.313 --> 00:56:44.974
Have a nice trip!

00:57:12.008 --> 00:57:14.943
Oh, God. I got saved.

00:57:15.278 --> 00:57:16.939
It's so embarrassing.

00:57:18.014 --> 00:57:21.279
Have you seen me! I spoke
so good English.

00:57:21.351 --> 00:57:22.943
Shut up!

00:57:24.554 --> 00:57:26.112
So what if they saw us?

00:57:26.189 --> 00:57:29.124
Haven't you seen me, the way
I went to them and talked...

00:57:29.192 --> 00:57:32.958
...as if this is the French reviera and
I am walking around in swimming trunks.

00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:36.965
Shut up! What do you know
shorty? You have nothing at stake.

00:57:39.569 --> 00:57:43.207
Your attitudes are just like
a middle-class Bengali.

00:57:43.207 --> 00:57:44.404
Smartly bathe!

00:57:44.541 --> 00:57:45.974
Give me that soap.

00:57:55.051 --> 00:57:58.987
My luck is just really bad.

00:58:03.093 --> 00:58:05.926
You on the other hand will
sail through this.

00:58:08.265 --> 00:58:10.927
Why should I be get
involved in all this?

00:58:12.002 --> 00:58:14.937
It's your game, you play it.

00:58:17.007 --> 00:58:19.942
As you have said that
I am a conventional.

00:58:20.277 --> 00:58:23.940
You feel bad. You feel offended.

00:58:25.015 --> 00:58:27.950
Ok, then. Do as you wish.

00:58:29.019 --> 00:58:31.954
Asim! Asim!

00:58:32.022 --> 00:58:33.956
Why are shouting 'Asim! Asim! '?

00:58:34.124 --> 00:58:35.455
What's that?

00:58:35.525 --> 00:58:37.288
Tomorrow morning we have
to go to the breakfast.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.952
Let's go now.

00:58:39.296 --> 00:58:40.957
You haven't drunk today either?

00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:42.123
Some other time.

00:58:42.199 --> 00:58:43.962
I'll take a measure home.

00:58:44.034 --> 00:58:46.969
Drink it! Drink it!

00:58:57.047 --> 00:59:00.915
Some people are unable to
keep their purse safely...

00:59:01.084 --> 00:59:04.918
Who? Me...
- No, it's not you.

00:59:08.992 --> 00:59:10.926
What's he doing?

00:59:10.994 --> 00:59:13.929
Today Miss India is not there.

00:59:13.997 --> 00:59:15.931
Don't irritate him!

00:59:15.999 --> 00:59:17.261
Shouldn't I?

00:59:21.004 --> 00:59:24.940
Hey! Hey! Listen!
- What?

00:59:26.009 --> 00:59:27.442
In the morning they
returned your purse...

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:28.943
...and you didn't even thank them.

00:59:29.012 --> 00:59:30.946
I have thanked them.
- Who thanked them?

00:59:31.014 --> 00:59:32.106
You did!

00:59:32.182 --> 00:59:35.948
So what if I did? Was
that my purse?

00:59:36.193 --> 00:59:37.412
Do I have a monthly?

00:59:37.412 --> 00:59:39.004
You have a car!

00:59:41.024 --> 00:59:45.961
Tomorrow, you must go to them
that it was your wallet.

00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:48.964
And give them a big 'Thank
you, very much'.

00:59:49.032 --> 00:59:50.966
What will you say?

00:59:52.135 --> 00:59:53.966
What will you say?

00:59:56.039 --> 00:59:59.975
Why are you laughing? Hari?

01:00:00.043 --> 01:00:01.977
Hari?

01:00:02.045 --> 01:00:04.309
You... you... has he gone crazy?

01:00:04.381 --> 01:00:05.973
Why are you laughing?

01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:08.312
Hey... cool down...

01:00:08.385 --> 01:00:10.979
What... what happened?

01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:15.991
I saw you two out the window,
with soap all over you...

01:00:16.059 --> 01:00:19.995
You saw all that!

01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:21.997
What happened?

01:00:22.065 --> 01:00:23.999
...and he was saying...

01:00:25.068 --> 01:00:28.333
very kind of you, have a nice trip.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:49.021
Dance for us...

01:00:49.092 --> 01:00:51.356
Yes... yes... please dance...

01:00:51.428 --> 01:00:57.025
You know how to dance...
you danced with

01:00:58.368 --> 01:01:04.307
She danced well... that voluptuous
woman who ditched you...

01:01:04.374 --> 01:01:05.966
Tomorrow we are invited for
breakfast at Rini's place...

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:07.976
Come let's go...

01:01:08.044 --> 01:01:10.308
I'll dance... I'll dance...

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.974
Everybody... look at Hari...
he'll dance...

01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:16.979
Dance Dance...

01:01:17.053 --> 01:01:19.988
Don't forget tomorrow's breakfast...

01:01:20.056 --> 01:01:21.990
Dance...

01:01:22.058 --> 01:01:24.322
Hey... dance...

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:43.001
Hey... a car is coming...
halt... halt... halt...

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:50.820
Santhal twist!

01:01:51.087 --> 01:01:53.021
I'm telling you... one minute.
. one minute...

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:59.027
why are you standing in front
of the car... one minute...

01:02:01.031 --> 01:02:06.970
Do you know who we are? We are
VIPs...

01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:13.977
very important people...

01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:16.977
very important person...

01:02:17.047 --> 01:02:18.981
Press the horn...

01:02:54.084 --> 01:02:57.019
Hari... Hari... hey Sanjay,

01:02:59.089 --> 01:03:02.115
Sanjay... look... it's 9:30 a. m.

01:03:02.192 --> 01:03:04.956
What?
- It's 9:30 sharp...

01:03:06.129 --> 01:03:10.964
Our prestige is at stake because
of last night's boozing...

01:03:15.038 --> 01:03:16.972
It's too late to go now...

01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:22.478
We should at least go
once to apologise...

01:03:41.064 --> 01:03:42.326
Here...
- Hm...

01:03:42.398 --> 01:03:43.990
Letter...

01:03:51.341 --> 01:03:54.003
You might be embarrassed to
see the tiffin carrier...

01:03:54.077 --> 01:03:58.013
but actually it's not your fault
you've come for a holiday...

01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:00.106
so rather it's our fault to
call you all for breakfast...

01:04:00.183 --> 01:04:01.946
...so early in the morning.

01:04:02.118 --> 01:04:06.282
I'm sending some food for you.

01:04:07.123 --> 01:04:09.114
I hope it'll be sufficient
for you...

01:04:09.192 --> 01:04:11.126
I might go to your place
in the evening...

01:04:11.194 --> 01:04:12.957
I'll get the Tiffin carrier then...

01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:16.965
...sincerely yours... Jaya Tripathi...

01:04:19.469 --> 01:04:20.959
So, what do you understand?

01:04:27.043 --> 01:04:34.973
My mind is not in my heart

01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:41.980
Who is calling me?

01:04:42.058 --> 01:04:43.320
Is that grandfather singing?

01:04:43.393 --> 01:04:44.485
Yes... I think so...

01:04:56.172 --> 01:05:00.939
In the morning the flowers
open their doors to see him

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:09.941
The bees call out his
name again and again

01:05:10.019 --> 01:05:16.948
He is calling me again and again?

01:05:17.026 --> 01:05:23.955
My voice became silent
praising him

01:05:24.133 --> 01:05:31.972
The forest, hills, flowers
praise him too

01:05:32.041 --> 01:05:40.312
The moon and the stars spend
sleepless nights in his love

01:05:40.383 --> 01:05:48.313
The moon and the stars spend
sleepless nights in his love

01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:57.993
his love is flowing through
hundred streams

01:05:58.067 --> 01:06:03.937
Who is calling me?

01:06:04.007 --> 01:06:13.939
Who is calling me?

01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:21.115
Father, today a lot of people
heard you singing!

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:22.953
What?

01:06:23.026 --> 01:06:25.961
What is this... this wasn't the plan...

01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:27.291
you were supposed to come and
have breakfast with us...

01:06:27.363 --> 01:06:28.455
instead of that...

01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:30.123
...you are listening to a old
man singing spiritual song!

01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:31.962
No... actually you sing so well!

01:06:32.035 --> 01:06:35.971
I've become old... don't have
any control on breath...

01:06:36.039 --> 01:06:38.974
and then I forget words...
I have to depend on...

01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:40.976
...my daughter's memory
while singing...

01:06:41.044 --> 01:06:42.978
We would miss your song
if we came on time.

01:06:44.147 --> 01:06:45.978
Really... we don't have
words to apolo...

01:06:46.049 --> 01:06:48.984
Enough... enough... we don't want
to hear anything about that.

01:06:49.052 --> 01:06:50.986
No, we are really sorry
for the delay...

01:06:51.154 --> 01:06:52.985
Whom are you apologising to?

01:06:53.156 --> 01:06:56.319
Ask them how punctual they are
about their appointments...

01:06:56.392 --> 01:06:59.156
Last night only they were supposed
to come back home by 8 o' clock.

01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:01.924
. ask them when did they return?

01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:03.260
They were not leaving us...

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:07.429
I was so worried...

01:07:07.503 --> 01:07:08.936
You were playing cards father...

01:07:09.005 --> 01:07:10.097
Don't you feel worried...

01:07:10.173 --> 01:07:13.939
they had to travel all the way
through the forest at night...

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.271
We'll go to the circus today...

01:07:17.613 --> 01:07:22.107
Grandson, tell them what you saw
at night in the headlight?

01:07:22.185 --> 01:07:25.951
One rabbit and two wild cat!

01:07:27.123 --> 01:07:28.954
Thank god, that was not
too much of a problem!

01:07:29.025 --> 01:07:31.960
The problem is not because of the
wild animals, but sometimes...

01:07:32.028 --> 01:07:34.121
...you get to see drunk people
standing in front of your car.

01:07:34.197 --> 01:07:35.960
...that becomes a problem.

01:07:36.032 --> 01:07:37.124
Thank you

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.294
The tribal are so frightening,
they drink country liquor...

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.964
The country liquors are so bad...

01:07:43.039 --> 01:07:44.973
So, you are going to
the circus today.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:46.133
Not everybody...

01:07:46.209 --> 01:07:47.972
Only me and grandson...

01:07:49.312 --> 01:07:52.304
I was planning to go to your place
after lunch today for some chit chat

01:07:52.382 --> 01:07:53.974
I'll also chit chat

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.984
But today you'll go
to the circus, baby...

01:07:56.052 --> 01:07:57.986
I'll chit chat in the circus...

01:08:02.258 --> 01:08:05.921
That bag was...

01:08:05.995 --> 01:08:09.260
It was his bag... the one
you returned yesterday...

01:08:09.332 --> 01:08:13.928
I had guessed that... he was
playing most energetically...

01:08:14.103 --> 01:08:16.936
He was sleeping when you
came in the morning...

01:08:17.106 --> 01:08:18.937
Did you check the money?

01:08:19.008 --> 01:08:20.270
Yes...

01:08:20.343 --> 01:08:21.935
What?

01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:23.273
What yes?

01:08:28.017 --> 01:08:33.284
He sleeps so much!

01:08:38.027 --> 01:08:45.957
Look, keep the vase here...

01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:59.971
Bring the clothes of the guests
spread for drying...

01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:18.091
What is he doing?

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:19.930
Hey, what are you doing?

01:09:26.108 --> 01:09:28.941
Why are you disturbing us everyday...

01:09:29.111 --> 01:09:30.942
The conservator is coming...

01:09:31.013 --> 01:09:32.947
When?

01:09:33.015 --> 01:09:34.949
Any moment...

01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:36.951
So what did our clothes do?

01:09:37.453 --> 01:09:40.945
Just for cleanliness...

01:09:41.023 --> 01:09:42.957
Our clothes are cleaner
than your trousers...

01:09:43.025 --> 01:09:44.117
Yes...

01:09:44.193 --> 01:09:45.956
Come here and see...

01:09:50.299 --> 01:09:52.961
Well... good...

01:09:55.037 --> 01:09:56.971
No body can dismiss
you from yourjob...

01:09:57.139 --> 01:10:00.973
All because of the grace of god!

01:10:01.043 --> 01:10:02.305
No... no...

01:10:04.046 --> 01:10:07.982
So, let's make arrangements
under the tree...

01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:10.985
Um...?

01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:12.315
Let's go...

01:10:17.493 --> 01:10:18.983
Here... hold this...

01:10:39.348 --> 01:10:41.009
Watch man!

01:10:43.619 --> 01:10:45.018
Let me speak to him...

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:58.032
Good morning, sir... these people
have occupied the place, sir.

01:11:00.036 --> 01:11:02.971
We are here for the last two days...

01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:07.305
We liked the place very much...

01:11:10.046 --> 01:11:12.310
We never came to this area before...

01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:15.316
So we couldn't decide
where to stay...

01:11:15.384 --> 01:11:17.978
But we don't have reservation...

01:11:19.322 --> 01:11:21.984
Didn't you see the notice outside?

01:11:22.058 --> 01:11:25.994
Of course we have, but we hope
that you make exceptions in...

01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:27.154
...some cases.

01:11:33.069 --> 01:11:36.163
But why should I make exceptions
in your case...

01:11:36.238 --> 01:11:38.331
just give me one good reason...

01:11:41.177 --> 01:11:44.010
Do you know Mr. A. C Chaterjee?

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.015
I mean barrister Abani Chaterjee...

01:11:52.088 --> 01:11:53.350
Didn't you tell them?

01:11:53.422 --> 01:11:57.017
Yes, sir... I intimated that...

01:11:57.093 --> 01:12:00.028
Do you want to say that it is
completely unprecedented affair.

01:12:00.053 --> 01:12:02.030
Hasn't anyone ever stayed here
without a reservation before?

01:12:02.031 --> 01:12:04.966
I saw a car outside... is it your's?

01:12:05.034 --> 01:12:06.296
Yes it's mine...

01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:09.964
There is a bungalow ten miles
away from this place...

01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:12.974
I'm arranging that for you.
. pack your things and...

01:12:13.042 --> 01:12:15.306
...leave within two hours...

01:12:17.046 --> 01:12:18.308
We want to stay here...

01:12:18.381 --> 01:12:21.976
Why are you behaving like a kid?
You are rather silly...

01:12:22.151 --> 01:12:23.982
you look like decent folk...

01:12:29.058 --> 01:12:30.992
Good morning...
- Good morning...

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.151
Why didn't you come that day?

01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:35.322
I got stuck in something...

01:12:35.398 --> 01:12:37.332
We waited for you for so long!

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.992
How is your father?

01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:42.003
Good... have you met our friends?

01:12:42.071 --> 01:12:45.336
Oh, I didn't realise that
they are your friends.

01:12:45.408 --> 01:12:49.003
Yes... very old friends... they
have come from Kolkata...

01:12:49.078 --> 01:12:52.013
they'll go back after 2
- 3 days.

01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:54.015
Why are you so late?

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:57.018
Got stuck... is everything ready?

01:12:57.086 --> 01:12:58.348
Long back...

01:12:59.188 --> 01:13:00.450
Will you join us?

01:13:00.523 --> 01:13:01.956
What? Picnic?

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:03.116
Sort of...

01:13:03.192 --> 01:13:05.285
No... I've to go...

01:13:06.128 --> 01:13:07.959
Please try to come some other day.

01:13:17.039 --> 01:13:18.301
Come...

01:13:18.374 --> 01:13:19.466
Come...

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:28.312
Oh, you are too much...

01:13:28.384 --> 01:13:29.976
Thank god, you came
on the right time...

01:13:30.152 --> 01:13:32.985
Was he creating any problem?

01:13:33.155 --> 01:13:37.990
He was asking us to shift to
another bungalow within two hours.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.993
But he is not a bad human being...

01:13:41.063 --> 01:13:43.327
he became so embarrassed
to see us...

01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:46.994
Why can't he wait for two days?

01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:50.004
Come... everything is ready for you.

01:13:50.072 --> 01:13:52.006
I've brought some food for you.

01:13:52.074 --> 01:13:53.166
Oh... again...

01:13:53.242 --> 01:13:54.334
Oh, that's nothing...

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:57.004
they were cooking at home so I
asked to make a little more...

01:13:57.079 --> 01:13:58.341
Egg cutlet!?

01:14:11.026 --> 01:14:12.960
What are you watching?

01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:14.289
No... I mean...

01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:17.965
Come and have cutlet...

01:14:21.303 --> 01:14:22.964
Won't you have?

01:14:23.038 --> 01:14:24.972
You go ahead... I'm coming...

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.975
Watch man, give some water...

01:14:33.315 --> 01:14:35.977
I hope you didn't have lunch yet.

01:14:36.051 --> 01:14:37.313
No... we had our breakfast
around 10 a. m.

01:14:37.386 --> 01:14:38.478
That too bought from the market.

01:14:38.554 --> 01:14:41.990
Oh, so you eat market stuff?

01:14:42.057 --> 01:14:44.992
We had it only today... actually
the watchman's wife is sick...

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.493
and we can't rely on him...

01:14:46.562 --> 01:14:48.154
But since you are there, we
are not having to fast...

01:14:49.165 --> 01:14:50.996
Please take some...

01:14:53.335 --> 01:14:54.996
...did you get news of cricket?

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:56.162
Yes.

01:14:56.238 --> 01:14:57.330
So why are you looking so sad?

01:14:57.406 --> 01:14:58.998
No... it's fine...

01:15:00.109 --> 01:15:01.940
Sanjay...

01:15:02.011 --> 01:15:03.945
He is Asim.

01:15:04.113 --> 01:15:05.944
I'm Sanjay...

01:15:06.015 --> 01:15:07.949
I am Shekhar and he is Hari...

01:15:08.017 --> 01:15:09.109
Okay...

01:15:09.185 --> 01:15:10.447
Sit down.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.282
Please take...

01:15:12.354 --> 01:15:13.446
Thank you.

01:15:16.025 --> 01:15:17.959
Is there any fair happening near by?

01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:21.963
I've absolutely forgotten about
that... do you want to go?

01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:23.293
It's near by... 10 minutes
walking distance...

01:15:23.365 --> 01:15:25.458
Beside the river...
- Are you going?

01:15:25.534 --> 01:15:29.971
I very much want to go... Rini also
wants to buy glass bangles.

01:15:30.139 --> 01:15:31.970
Not a bad idea... we can go.

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:33.303
In the afternoon... - Yes...

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:34.967
...the sun light won't
be so hard then.

01:15:36.045 --> 01:15:37.979
Is there any gambling happening?

01:15:38.047 --> 01:15:39.480
Gamblers always look for gambling!

01:15:39.548 --> 01:15:42.984
They didn't let me bring cards,
otherwise we could play cards.

01:15:43.152 --> 01:15:46.986
Rini, what was that we used to play?

01:15:47.056 --> 01:15:48.990
Cards?
- No... no... not cards...

01:15:49.058 --> 01:15:52.994
something to do with famous
peoples name...

01:15:53.062 --> 01:15:54.996
Memory game?
- Yes... do you know?

01:15:55.164 --> 01:15:56.995
How is that?

01:15:57.666 --> 01:15:59.998
Rini, please come... let's play...

01:16:01.604 --> 01:16:02.935
Is everybody willing to play?

01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:06.941
Let's play... we'll have good time.

01:16:07.009 --> 01:16:09.944
It's a wonderful game, you know...
we had played here before...

01:16:10.613 --> 01:16:12.945
Rini will teach you all.

01:16:13.015 --> 01:16:14.107
Asim also knows.

01:16:14.183 --> 01:16:16.447
Yes, Asim knows... please teach them.

01:16:16.518 --> 01:16:18.110
They'll learn faster
if she teaches them.

01:16:20.022 --> 01:16:21.956
Come... sit here...

01:16:30.032 --> 01:16:31.294
Tell them...

01:16:34.036 --> 01:16:35.128
Sorry...

01:16:35.204 --> 01:16:41.973
No... no... it's okay... wear it.
. the game is very easy...

01:16:42.044 --> 01:16:47.983
now we are sitting in a circle...
suppose I'll start the game.

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:50.985
I'll tell the name of
a famous person...

01:16:51.053 --> 01:16:52.145
Any famous person?

01:16:52.221 --> 01:16:53.313
Yes...

01:16:53.389 --> 01:16:54.981
Poet, philosopher, jockey...

01:16:56.058 --> 01:17:00.927
But everyone should know the name.
. I'll tell a name...

01:17:00.996 --> 01:17:06.093
you are there after me... you
will say the name I said...

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:10.264
...and saya additional name of
your choice... then Hari...

01:17:10.439 --> 01:17:13.931
Hari will say the name I said,
then the name you said...

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:17.274
...and then a name of his choice...

01:17:17.346 --> 01:17:22.113
Okay... Gandhi... Gandhi, Neheru...
Ghandhi, Neheru, Ajad.

01:17:22.184 --> 01:17:24.948
Exactly... this way the
game will go on...

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:28.956
those who will forget a name or
miss out a name he or she...

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.457
...will be out.

01:17:30.559 --> 01:17:32.959
So he'll be the winner who'll
stay till the last, right?

01:17:33.128 --> 01:17:36.120
It's not so easy as
you are thinking.

01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:38.462
Yes, it's very tough... very often
you tend to make mistake.

01:17:38.534 --> 01:17:40.297
Oh, that's not a problem...

01:17:40.369 --> 01:17:41.961
Hari, you understand?

01:17:42.137 --> 01:17:43.968
Shall I start?

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.974
Hm... Rabindranath...

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:50.978

Oh, yes...

01:18:24.113 --> 01:18:25.944
Helen...

01:18:26.015 --> 01:18:27.949
Helen of Troy or Bombay?

01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:29.948
Not Bombay...

01:18:30.619 --> 01:18:32.951
It's alright... Helen of Troy...

01:18:33.122 --> 01:18:34.953

01:18:37.026 --> 01:18:39.460
Cleopatra, Atulya Ghosh.

01:18:39.528 --> 01:18:42.292
Helen of Troy, Shakespeare.

01:18:46.035 --> 01:18:47.969
Oh, I'm nervous...

01:18:49.304 --> 01:18:53.968
Rabindranath, Karl Marx, Cleopatra,
Prafulla...

01:18:54.043 --> 01:18:55.135
Out... out!

01:18:57.046 --> 01:19:00.914
How could I make the mistake?
It's Atulya...

01:19:00.983 --> 01:19:04.919
Don't shout or you'll
make me forget.

01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:13.919
Rabindranath, Karl Marx, Cleopatra,
Atulya Ghosh.

01:19:14.096 --> 01:19:17.930

01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:43.283

01:19:43.358 --> 01:19:44.450
Out... out...

01:19:44.526 --> 01:19:46.960
Out... out... what did Asim say?
Did he say Mao Tse Tung?

01:19:47.029 --> 01:19:48.462
What did he say then?

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:49.963
Shakespeare!

01:19:51.033 --> 01:19:52.967
I won't play... I won't...

01:19:53.035 --> 01:19:54.969
Don't go... sit down...

01:19:55.037 --> 01:19:56.470
Sit down... where will you go?

01:19:56.538 --> 01:19:57.971
I'll have to sit?

01:20:01.043 --> 01:20:06.140

...out, out, Rani Rashmani.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.491
Come on Sanjay... fight...

01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:20.994
Wait... wait...

01:20:22.164 --> 01:20:28.000
Rabindranath, Karl Marx, Cleopatra,
Atulya Ghosh.

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:38.002
Helen of Troy, Shakespeare, out,
Mao Tse Tung...

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.011
...what did you say?

01:20:42.084 --> 01:20:44.018
Don't you remember?

01:20:45.087 --> 01:20:46.349
Isn't there any time limit?

01:20:46.421 --> 01:20:49.015
Yes, there is... 10 seconds...

01:20:49.091 --> 01:20:51.025
I'll count...

01:20:52.528 --> 01:20:57.022

Helen of Troy, Shakespeare, Mao
Tse Tung, Don Bradman,

01:21:15.217 --> 01:21:18.983
Rani Rashmani, Kennedy.

01:21:19.154 --> 01:21:20.985
Which Kennedy?

01:21:21.056 --> 01:21:22.318
Bobby.

01:21:24.493 --> 01:21:30.329
Hm... Rabindranath, Karl Marx,
Cleopatra, Atulya Ghosh...

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:34.995
Do you want a pillow?
- Do you have one?

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:37.004
Yes...
- Let him finish...

01:21:37.072 --> 01:21:41.168

01:21:49.084 --> 01:21:52.019
Rabindranath,
Karl Marx, Cleopatra...

01:22:11.473 --> 01:22:18.970
Rani Rashmani, Kennedy, Teckchand
Thakur, Napoleon... thank you.

01:22:19.147 --> 01:22:24.983
Rabindranath, Karl Marx, Cleopatra,
Atulya Ghosh.

01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:27.988
Helen of Troy...

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:31.318
Do you like Santhali ornaments?

01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:32.485
Hm...?

01:22:32.561 --> 01:22:34.995
Santhali ornaments...
do you like them?

01:22:35.063 --> 01:22:36.997
Yes... it looks good on Santhals...

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:38.325
Don Bradman...

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.493
Don't know... I'll have
to buy for my cousin...

01:22:40.569 --> 01:22:47.338
Rani Rashmani, Kennedy...

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.342
...shut up...

01:22:55.183 --> 01:23:01.952
Teckchand Thakur, Napoleon,
Mumtazmahal... your turn...

01:23:08.130 --> 01:23:09.961
I think I won't be able to say...

01:23:10.032 --> 01:23:11.966
What are you saying?

01:23:13.035 --> 01:23:14.969
Don't you remember?

01:23:20.142 --> 01:23:22.303
My situation is like Hari...

01:23:22.477 --> 01:23:23.967
Are you trying to say that you
don't remember the names of...

01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:25.308
...the beginning?

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.974
Do you want some chilled water?

01:23:32.654 --> 01:23:35.987
No... out... Asim wins!

01:24:53.335 --> 01:24:55.997
They are looking so beautiful...

01:24:56.071 --> 01:24:58.005
hope they'll last till Kolkata...

01:24:58.073 --> 01:24:59.335
How much?

01:24:59.508 --> 01:25:00.941
What is all this?

01:25:01.009 --> 01:25:02.271
What do you mean?

01:25:02.444 --> 01:25:04.935
Can't I even pay for your bangles?

01:25:05.113 --> 01:25:07.946
How wild do you think we are?

01:25:08.016 --> 01:25:10.280
If you do like this then we'll
have to stop buying things.

01:25:10.352 --> 01:25:12.946
Buy whatever you like... after
all this is not New market...

01:25:14.022 --> 01:25:15.956
Can you see this? This is full...

01:25:23.298 --> 01:25:25.129
Asim please lend me 10 rupees...

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.292
Why?

01:25:26.368 --> 01:25:28.302
I'll return you with interest.
. guaranteed...

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:29.462
I've left my purse back...

01:25:29.538 --> 01:25:30.971
Where have you left it? In Kolkata?

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:32.472
I mean...
- I'll give you...

01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:34.304
No... no... don't give him...
he'll gamble...

01:25:34.376 --> 01:25:35.468
I know...

01:25:35.544 --> 01:25:40.311
No... no he'll give... he doesn't
refuse... please give...

01:25:44.052 --> 01:25:45.986
So kind of you...

01:25:46.054 --> 01:25:47.146
Where is Hari?

01:25:47.222 --> 01:25:48.314
Don't know.

01:25:51.159 --> 01:25:53.150
Your purse is empty now...

01:25:53.228 --> 01:25:54.991
No... no... I can still buy
you some fried chops.

01:25:55.063 --> 01:25:56.325
Let me pay for that.

01:25:56.398 --> 01:25:58.161
No way! Let's go...

01:25:58.233 --> 01:25:59.996
Sister-in-law will you be here?

01:26:02.003 --> 01:26:03.937
Yes... give me my money...

01:26:08.009 --> 01:26:09.943
Come back when you finish shopping...

01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:11.945
Why did you have take that?

01:26:13.014 --> 01:26:16.108
We'll go back if you are late...
- Okay...

01:26:16.184 --> 01:26:18.948
Your house is only 10
minutes from here...

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.955
My son will wait for me...

01:26:24.025 --> 01:26:25.959
It feels great in a fair, isn't it?

01:26:26.027 --> 01:26:28.962
I don't know how it would have
felt if you were not here...

01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:30.964
I might not come...

01:26:32.033 --> 01:26:34.968
Where is your other friend?

01:26:35.036 --> 01:26:37.971
I think he didn't like
your company...

01:26:38.573 --> 01:26:43.977
a girl like you had once ditched
him... do you understand?

01:26:44.045 --> 01:26:46.980
Yes, I do.

01:26:47.048 --> 01:26:48.982
Hey guys... I'm here...

01:26:50.318 --> 01:26:53.310
You go ahead... I'll go
and bring some food...

01:27:09.104 --> 01:27:10.935
I'll... I'll beat you!

01:27:11.006 --> 01:27:12.098
Why?

01:27:12.173 --> 01:27:13.265
Why didn't you come?

01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:14.433
Where?

01:27:14.509 --> 01:27:17.945
Where...? There... where you were
sitting and drinking liquor...

01:27:18.013 --> 01:27:19.275
There was a dance programme
after that...

01:27:19.347 --> 01:27:21.941
Dance programme? Why did you
go to the bungalow to work?

01:27:22.017 --> 01:27:24.952
Master gave me money... why
shouldn't I work if I get money?

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.112
Why should you work even
if he gave you money?

01:27:26.187 --> 01:27:27.950
Shouldn't I? - No...

01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:33.959
I'll give you money... I'll
give it to you for no work...

01:27:40.135 --> 01:27:41.295
so much greed!

01:27:47.142 --> 01:27:50.305
You win... take your money...

01:27:52.314 --> 01:27:54.145
...are you going? - Yes...

01:27:56.051 --> 01:27:58.986
if I play more I'll loose.

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:03.082
Take it.

01:28:03.158 --> 01:28:04.250
Have you given this
to sister-in-law?

01:28:04.326 --> 01:28:06.260
She won't have.
- And your friend?

01:28:06.328 --> 01:28:07.920
He won't have either...

01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:12.262
don't stare like that, otherwise
I'll have to tell the truth.

01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:14.935
So you didn't go to them.

01:28:15.003 --> 01:28:17.096
You stay all the time with your
sister-in-law, please stay...

01:28:17.172 --> 01:28:18.935
...sometime with me.

01:28:19.274 --> 01:28:21.936
Am I running away?

01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:23.272
I wanted to discus something
with you...

01:28:23.345 --> 01:28:24.937
Tell me.

01:28:25.013 --> 01:28:29.950
This is not the right place...
let's go outside the fair...

01:28:30.118 --> 01:28:34.953
I need to go to the bungalow also.
I've left my glasses there.

01:28:35.023 --> 01:28:36.285
Let's go...

01:29:17.549 --> 01:29:18.607
Tell me what you wanted to say.

01:29:18.683 --> 01:29:20.674
You lost deliberately
today, isn't it?

01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:28.953
I still remember those names...
do you remember?

01:29:39.637 --> 01:29:41.298
That's a special
power I posses...

01:29:41.706 --> 01:29:45.642
I still have memories of the
time when I was 2 years old.

01:29:50.248 --> 01:29:51.579
Why did you lose then?

01:29:54.652 --> 01:29:58.247
Can't you understand that?
Would you feel good if I won?

01:30:01.726 --> 01:30:07.926
That's the problem... first
bath by the well...

01:30:09.934 --> 01:30:15.531
...then the warning of the
conservator... what a shame!

01:30:18.543 --> 01:30:22.877
There is more... Santhal
twist on the road...

01:30:27.886 --> 01:30:30.753
Was that your car?

01:30:31.756 --> 01:30:33.451
What did you have to drink?

01:30:33.625 --> 01:30:35.456
And you were watching that!?

01:30:35.693 --> 01:30:37.456
Yes... I was enjoying...

01:30:40.698 --> 01:30:44.293
The shame! It's an
absolute disaster...

01:30:44.369 --> 01:30:50.715
...believe me... what ever I may do
but I never mean to be a laughing stock

01:30:52.777 --> 01:30:55.712
Still I'll say that you
are very childish!

01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:57.771
You too are saying
that I'm childish?

01:30:59.584 --> 01:31:02.417
Wasn't it childishness... the
way you occupied the bungalow...

01:31:07.659 --> 01:31:11.595
What do you think, if we wanted,
couldn't we book the bungalow?

01:31:12.664 --> 01:31:13.926
Then why didn't you do it.

01:31:16.144 --> 01:31:18.144
You don't understand...

01:31:19.437 --> 01:31:21.268
You love breaking rules, right?

01:31:21.439 --> 01:31:25.273
Not all the time, sometimes.
You don't have a job...

01:31:25.343 --> 01:31:30.440
...so how will you understand
the pressure of rules.

01:31:31.683 --> 01:31:36.450
You were there, otherwise we
had decided not even to shave.

01:31:37.689 --> 01:31:40.453
But you'll have to follow the
rules once again when you go back.

01:31:40.692 --> 01:31:42.284
Of course I'll have to...

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.624
...otherwise from where
will the salary come.

01:31:45.697 --> 01:31:47.289
You won't have any problem
to get your salary...

01:31:47.365 --> 01:31:49.230
...after all you haven't
taken bribe...

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.733
...rather you bribed somebody.

01:31:51.703 --> 01:31:54.638
I'm just worried about
the watchman.

01:32:01.513 --> 01:32:05.415
Do I have to listen
this also from you?

01:32:06.584 --> 01:32:08.848
Let the ranger say,
the conservator say...

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.445
Even, let the watchman himself
say 500 times, but why you?

01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:18.927
It doesn't suit you...
why are you smiling?

01:32:20.598 --> 01:32:22.259
I'm thinking that
tomorrow when...

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:24.267
...you all will be having
your breakfast...

01:32:24.335 --> 01:32:26.667
...we'll be at Ranchi
by that time.

01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:29.667
What do you mean?

01:32:30.608 --> 01:32:33.270
Yesterday I came to know that
a friend of mine at Kolkata...

01:32:33.344 --> 01:32:35.278
...is all of a sudden going
to get married...

01:32:35.947 --> 01:32:37.608
So we are going back tomorrow.

01:32:51.763 --> 01:32:53.230
Where is your husband?

01:32:53.565 --> 01:32:54.725
He died.

01:32:56.234 --> 01:32:57.428
Died?

01:32:58.636 --> 01:33:02.436
God knows where he is
born again as a baby.

01:33:04.642 --> 01:33:09.238
He went to the forest to fetch
fire wood... and a snake...

01:33:09.314 --> 01:33:10.440
Snake bit him?

01:33:11.583 --> 01:33:18.455
Probably a cobra... he's
been dead three years.

01:33:18.656 --> 01:33:20.419
Will you go to Kolkata?

01:33:21.526 --> 01:33:23.460
There are lots of work
opportunity in Kolkata!

01:33:23.528 --> 01:33:26.588
Come to Kolkata and I'll
show you my game...

01:33:26.664 --> 01:33:30.259
...cricket... have you
seen my wrist...

01:33:30.335 --> 01:33:32.269
I send the ball over
the boundary.

01:33:35.607 --> 01:33:37.472
Fulmani has been to Kolkata...

01:33:38.543 --> 01:33:42.946
...she bought blouses
and net for her bun...

01:33:44.616 --> 01:33:46.277
What do you apply in your hair?

01:33:51.489 --> 01:33:54.617
Do you know what I'll bring
for you? Tell me...

01:33:54.826 --> 01:33:56.293
How do I know?

01:33:56.361 --> 01:34:00.422
I'll bring false hair for you!

01:34:28.426 --> 01:34:30.792
Give me... give that to me...

01:34:36.601 --> 01:34:39.263
Since there is shortage
of time...

01:34:39.337 --> 01:34:44.604
...let me speak my heart out...
I like you very much.

01:34:46.744 --> 01:34:50.202
Initially I thought
that you are like...

01:34:50.281 --> 01:34:54.741
...those Kolkata girls who
are busy with parties...

01:34:54.819 --> 01:34:57.379
...but now I know that
you are not like that.

01:34:58.623 --> 01:35:01.217
Do you know what I felt
when I saw you first?

01:35:02.493 --> 01:35:04.222
I thought that it would
be wonderful...

01:35:04.295 --> 01:35:06.229
...if I can shake this
gentleman's confidence.

01:35:08.766 --> 01:35:12.224
The confidence is no more
there. You really have shaken it.

01:35:12.403 --> 01:35:16.237
But I don't understand
one thing...

01:35:16.307 --> 01:35:22.769
...I am not being able to
understand you properly.

01:35:25.516 --> 01:35:27.575
Maybe I can help you.

01:35:28.419 --> 01:35:29.579
Please do that.

01:35:34.659 --> 01:35:39.255
3 years back my brother
had committed suicide...

01:35:40.598 --> 01:35:50.200
...he was my best friend, and
when I was 12 years old...

01:35:50.374 --> 01:36:01.717
...my mother died of burning,
I was alone at the house then...

01:36:05.223 --> 01:36:13.221
...when I was in first year of
college I had come here...

01:36:13.297 --> 01:36:24.902
...and I saw fire in
the distant forest...

01:36:26.644 --> 01:36:29.408
...I had fainted seeing that...

01:36:36.654 --> 01:36:40.750
I think you never got any big
shock in your life, right?

01:36:56.808 --> 01:36:58.469
Bye... come again tomorrow...

01:36:59.477 --> 01:37:00.603
Where?

01:37:00.678 --> 01:37:04.808
Where... in the fair...
come or I'll beat you...

01:37:08.219 --> 01:37:10.210
...if you come I'll give
you more money.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.496
What happened? Oh, my
purse has fallen down...

01:38:44.582 --> 01:38:48.416
Asim... Asim...

01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:00.427
Sanjay... Sanjay...

01:39:05.436 --> 01:39:08.269
The car is not there and
also there's no light.

01:39:08.439 --> 01:39:12.603
Thank God, if he had come and saw
that I was not here, he'd have 
started whining

01:39:12.677 --> 01:39:13.769
If you wanted, you could
have stayed there...

01:39:13.844 --> 01:39:15.277
...for some more time.

01:39:15.346 --> 01:39:17.439
When you have come so far,
please come inside.

01:39:18.349 --> 01:39:20.783
I'll make coffee for you.
- Coffee!

01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:23.285
Yes, Nescafe!

01:39:23.454 --> 01:39:26.287
I like it very much. Let's go.

01:39:30.361 --> 01:39:33.626
There's so much silence!
- Terrible.

01:39:35.366 --> 01:39:37.300
Do you like it?

01:39:38.369 --> 01:39:41.304
It's a new place. We have to.

01:39:41.372 --> 01:39:42.634
It's strange.

01:39:44.375 --> 01:39:46.309
You don't like it?

01:39:47.378 --> 01:39:52.247
Staying here for long time
is not that enjoyable.

01:39:52.316 --> 01:39:56.252
To be honest, I feel
a little bit scared.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:00.254
You all were here, so it was fun.

01:40:00.324 --> 01:40:03.259
Paramesh!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:40:03.427 --> 01:40:06.260
Boil some water, I'll
make some coffee.

01:40:13.437 --> 01:40:14.768
Please come in.

01:40:14.839 --> 01:40:16.272
Keep them these.

01:40:24.615 --> 01:40:26.276
Will you not sit here?

01:40:27.351 --> 01:40:29.285
Unless there is light...

01:40:33.457 --> 01:40:34.788
Now!

01:40:34.859 --> 01:40:36.292
Everything is clear.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.291
Please sit.

01:40:45.803 --> 01:40:47.634
You watch this. I'll
be back in a moment.

01:40:48.906 --> 01:40:51.238
This lamp is very beautiful.

01:40:51.409 --> 01:40:53.240
Don't steal it.

01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:54.572
Not until I get my coffee.

01:41:00.317 --> 01:41:03.252
Take this.
- Thank you.

01:41:04.422 --> 01:41:08.256
That day when we saw you bathing,
I felt very jealous.

01:41:08.426 --> 01:41:11.259
Actually, we have shortage of water.

01:41:24.608 --> 01:41:29.272
Do you what happened
to gatekeeper's wife?

01:41:30.347 --> 01:41:32.281
I don't know exactly.

01:42:10.321 --> 01:42:14.257
She is in such a poor condition.
Did you know it?

01:42:17.328 --> 01:42:19.262
Somewhat!

01:42:20.431 --> 01:42:22.592
I never dared to come, this side.

01:42:25.336 --> 01:42:28.271
Your father is well acquainted
with the conservator. Isn't he?

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:31.274
Look there!

01:43:12.316 --> 01:43:14.250
Shekhar!
- What happened!?
- Dacoits...thugs...

01:43:15.319 --> 01:43:16.581
Why are you bleeding?

01:43:16.654 --> 01:43:22.813
Hit me with a stick, thugs...
My money bag...

01:43:23.327 --> 01:43:27.593
Don't worry, we will visit a doctor.

01:43:33.337 --> 01:43:37.273
What happened? Do you
want a cold coffee?

01:43:39.443 --> 01:43:41.274
Mrs. Tripathi!

01:44:16.413 --> 01:44:18.574
How do I look?

01:44:29.593 --> 01:44:33.256
You said it only looked good
on Santhals?

01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:35.261
No, I mean...

01:44:37.334 --> 01:44:43.273
What are you staring at!
Tell me how do I look?

01:44:44.341 --> 01:44:47.276
Good!
- Good!

01:44:47.344 --> 01:44:49.209
Are you having mercy at me?

01:45:05.296 --> 01:45:10.233
When a husband dies he dies alone.

01:45:14.405 --> 01:45:17.238
My husband committed suicide?
Do you know?

01:45:17.408 --> 01:45:20.241
Is it so? Why?

01:45:21.312 --> 01:45:22.574
How can I know?

01:45:22.646 --> 01:45:27.242
He didn't die here, abroad. 
Maybe, he was having some problem.

01:45:36.427 --> 01:45:38.258
Are you feeling nervous?

01:45:41.875 --> 01:45:43.875
No

01:45:44.335 --> 01:45:46.269
I am feeling nervous!

01:45:48.272 --> 01:45:49.534
See!

01:46:15.566 --> 01:46:17.557
That's not our vehicle.

01:46:37.421 --> 01:46:40.584
You had your coffee!

01:47:04.715 --> 01:47:06.205
Rini...

01:47:07.284 --> 01:47:09.218
...tell me one thing!

01:47:11.288 --> 01:47:13.222
What?

01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:15.224
You don't have a friend?

01:47:15.826 --> 01:47:17.225
Why wouldn't I?

01:47:17.294 --> 01:47:19.228
It's not the time to crack jokes.

01:47:20.397 --> 01:47:25.232
You don't love anybody?

01:47:30.407 --> 01:47:32.238
Not till now.

01:47:37.581 --> 01:47:40.243
Where can I meet you in Kolkata?

01:47:40.851 --> 01:47:44.252
I don't go to parties.
I don't like them.

01:47:44.321 --> 01:47:46.585
It's Ok, but where can I meet you?

01:47:48.258 --> 01:47:50.192
Leave my hand.

01:47:59.269 --> 01:48:01.203
Will you switch on your lighter?

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.212
I didn't find any other paper.

01:48:34.304 --> 01:48:36.238
Sanjay!

01:48:41.311 --> 01:48:43.245
What are you thinking so much
about? - No, nothing.

01:48:43.413 --> 01:48:44.744
Is sister-in-law back?

01:48:44.815 --> 01:48:47.249
Yes, we were drinking coffee.

01:48:47.417 --> 01:48:49.248
Did you just come back?

01:48:49.319 --> 01:48:52.254
Yes, I forgot my glasses
at the bungalow.

01:48:52.589 --> 01:48:54.580
Tomorrow, we are leaving.

01:48:54.658 --> 01:48:55.750
Really!

01:48:55.826 --> 01:48:57.760
Convey my regards to
your other friends.

01:48:57.828 --> 01:49:01.264
O sure! It was fun here,
in your company.

01:49:04.334 --> 01:49:05.767
I'll talk to father.

01:49:05.836 --> 01:49:08.270
I guess that that thing will
be accomplished.

01:49:21.979 --> 01:49:23.979
What thing what that?

01:49:25.622 --> 01:49:28.455
We were talking about
that gatekeeper.

01:49:29.459 --> 01:49:33.293
His father is well acquainted
with the conservator.

01:49:33.363 --> 01:49:38.300
Good! I was also thinking
about that matter.

01:49:51.582 --> 01:49:52.742
Gatekeeper!

01:49:54.318 --> 01:49:57.253
You will go there and every
wound of yours will be fine.

01:49:57.321 --> 01:49:58.754
Again, you are talking
about the wound!

01:49:58.822 --> 01:50:01.256
Hari! How are you feeling?

01:50:02.326 --> 01:50:04.419
If somebody asks you
about the wound...

01:50:04.494 --> 01:50:06.257
...tell them that you had a
fight with a wild buffalo.

01:50:17.341 --> 01:50:20.276
Take this! Now you'll
not lose your job.

01:50:21.345 --> 01:50:24.280
Things have been fixed
with the conservator.

01:50:24.348 --> 01:50:29.285
Sir, the driver has left a box
for you. I am bringing it!

01:50:30.354 --> 01:50:31.616
Shekhar!

01:50:39.363 --> 01:50:42.298
I forgot it completely.
Sorry! Thank you!

01:50:42.366 --> 01:50:43.628
Shekhar!

01:50:45.369 --> 01:50:48.304
Where's my money,
with interest?

01:50:48.329 --> 01:50:52.782
Believe me, it was a complete loss,
wholesale! Never happened before!

01:50:52.782 --> 01:50:54.782
Never mind, get in the car.

01:51:00.417 --> 01:51:03.250
Their driver gave this box.

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.253
Let me see.

01:51:10.327 --> 01:51:12.261
Eggs!
