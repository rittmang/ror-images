Hello,
- Tell me.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.080
One two three four

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.880
Play like this correctly.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.480
Brother, Play the drum,
that line is tricky.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.440
Ta taam, Yeah, Yeah that's it.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.680

See, I'll say Vande Mataram,
Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.400
Good morning uncle

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.080
One two three four

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.280
First, first, Amal you begin the song.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.800

Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram,
Vande Mataram Vande Mataram,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.120
Like his films the music of Satyajit
Ray is a unique multi-layered...

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.120
...blending of western
sense and Indian sensibility.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.840
His complete mastery of this
art form is a culmination...

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.840
...of a long family tradition.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.000
I was born in a musical family,
my grandfather UpendraKishore...

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.280
...was a composer, violinist.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.760
He played the flute,
he played the pakhawaj.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.840
And on my mother's side,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.640
...my mother's
grandfather KaliNarayan Gupta,...

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.240
...was a wonderful composer and...

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.400
...it so happens that
on my mothers side...

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.160
...practically
everyone is a natural singer.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.880
My grandmother could sing
and all her sisters could sing.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.160
My mother could sing and my
mother's sisters, brothers...

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.160
...and cousin were
all natural singers.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.640
So I grew up in an
atmosphere of music and...

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.680
...singing Rabindra Sangeet...

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.840
...and Brahma Sangeet,
right from my birth.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.480
I have been exposed to western
classical music from a very early age.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.960
There were some records of
classical music in my house.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.880
I don't know where they came from...

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.360
...but I had heard
Beethoven's works...

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.520
...and some other western
music from when I was a small boy.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.120
I had a gramophone,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.800
...a toy gramophone and some
small records given to me...

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.680
...as a birthday present
which consisted of all,...

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.240
...all of it was western music
waltzes, marches and all that.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.520
so western music has
never been unfamiliar to me.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.120
I was exposed to it and I had
heard it along with Bengali songs...

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.720
...and Bengali music I was
listening to western music,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.200
...of some kind or...

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.280
...other and it developed into
a very serious interest when...

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800
...I was at school.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.120
Towards the end when I
was thirteen fourteen.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.520
I had a friend at school...

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.720
...who was came from
fairly well to do family.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.920
And he also got
interested in western music and...

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.520
...he started buying records.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.840
It was in his house that I was
able to listen to music of...

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.120
...Bach Beethoven,
Mozart's, Tchaikovsky.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.560
So I got initiated very very
early when I was at school.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.680
When other boys were
writing poetry or reading poetry.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.080
I was listening to music...

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.640
...reading about it
going to libraries because...

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.320
...I couldn't afford to buy books.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.160
Reading about composers and
compositions and musical forms.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.200
So it was a very early initiation.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:44.400
"Pather Panchali" Satyajit Ray

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.640
Well this was at the
time of chiliarchy,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.240
I had worked with Ravi Shankar.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.440
In "PATHER PANCHALI",

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.440
...Ray made a major breakthrough in,
Indian film music,...

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.400
...not only by using the gifts of a
classical composer like Ravi Shankar...

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.840
...but also by exploiting them...

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.000
...from an essentially
cinematic point of view.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.040
His collaborations with
several classical composers...

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.680
...in the next few films created,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.800
...a new idiom of film music in India.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.200
On "Jalsaghar" I had
worked with Vilayat Khan.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.080
(Story based on Prabhat
Kumar Mukhopadhyay's DEVI)

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.960
And on "Devi" I had
worked with Ali Akbar.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.480
But they had become very
busy international composers;

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.640
they were not always
available when I needed them and...

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.920
...I did not want to
dictate other composers.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.440
So at the time of "Teen
Kanya" in 1960, I think,...

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.480
I decided to try my
own hand at composition.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.520
It was very
difficult to start with but,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.160
...eventually in course of time...

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.360
...I managed to
acquire some professionalism.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.480

It was in "Teen Kanya"...

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.480
...that Ray proved that, as
film music is one of the...

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.600
...components of a film a
director of musical background,...

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.200
...is the fittest person to
do the scoring for his film.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.800
From "Teen Kanya" onwards,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.640
...Ray employed in each film
a theme music to underline...

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.080
...its central mood and
to suggest elite motive...

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.400
...in the multiplex
structure of the film.

...on natural sounds and
particularly silence and the...

"Kanchen Jungha" 1962

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.680
... sparing use of
musical accompaniment are...

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.880
...2 important features of Ray's music

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.080
There is something I want to say.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.680
He is a great man as we
belong to the new generation,...

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.040
...so the association,
particularly between him and us.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.120
I should leave.
- No wait, what I am saying is

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.200
I have been looking for you,
for quite a long time. - I know.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.120
Sir please give me some money,
Sir please give me some money.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.600
Take, this is yours.

Original story: Narendranath Mitra

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.320
Such a big city!

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.360
So many different kinds of jobs.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.640
Could none of us find one?

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.280
Let us try, I believe
we both will find one.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.920
You know, today amidst all this grief,

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.360
...where we do not know
what destiny holds for us...

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.520
...I still feel good.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.520
You are not afraid anymore. Are you?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.320
See.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.120
Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.640
Ideally, I think the
director should be aware,...

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.320
...where music would
be needed in his film.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.320
This is, I am talking of
the ideal situation...

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.600
...where it is assumed that...

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.760
...the director knows about music,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.800
...is conscious of music and also...

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.240
...knows where his
films would call for music.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.560
But of course the ideal
situation doesn't always exist...

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.680
and have directors who have
very little conception of music.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.240
Where of course...

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.960
...he has to depend entirely
on the professionals composers.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.760
There you have to assume that...

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.360
... the professional
composer is a competent composer.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.680
But in my case of course,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.000
...since I have been
aware of music,...

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.600
...from a very early age and
music has been my first love...

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.920
... even before the cinema.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.640
And since I do my own composition
I have very set ideas about...

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.720
...where music should
be used in the film.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.440
The flowers nod as if
intoxicated "Charu lata".

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.480
The most satisfying
experience to Ray as a music director.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.560
Even the structure of the film with...

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.880
...its subtle inner links is musical.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:27.160
A singing female parrot
tantalizes the surging wave even as...

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:44.720
...the cuckoo coos from its arbor.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.680
After the introduction of sound,
in their days very early...

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.880
...there was no music in films.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.040
As you can see,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.400
...if you see the films of
early 1930s, there is very often...

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.800
...no music at all.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.160
But gradually the system of background
music came into being and...

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.720
...professional composers
emerged and big offices emerged.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.120
There was a period then in the
40s or later it is when music

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.360
A film would be drowned in music.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.600
But even later after that...

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.560
...of course a kind of
balance was struck and...

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.880
...music was used very discreetly.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.080
But also at the same time
certain conventions developed.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.840
Like using a certain kind of
music for happy situations,...

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.520
...a certain kind of
music for sad situations,...

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.080
...another kind of music for
situations of suspense and...

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.160
...these became formulas.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.000
Sometimes lazy composers would
use these formulas rather than...

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.040
...think those situations afresh.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.160
We naturally tried to avoid these...

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.480
... hackneyed formulas
as much as possible.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.640
I think all directors
should avoid hackneyed formulas.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.080
Consider a situation
afresh and try to be original...

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:13.440
...and avoid conventions
avoid worn-out conventions.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:59.800
The call of cuckoo

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.840
The pain of cuckoo

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:55.080
My village

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.880
What's the matter?

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.040
See.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.360
In my case of course, I use
music now less and less and less.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.040
"Sadgati" 1981.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.880
There are some directors in the west,
as an example Bergman,...

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.000
...who hardly ever uses
any music in his films.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.600
But we still do use music,
partly because,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.520
...out of
consideration for the audience,...

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.120
...because sometimes the audience,

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.320
we feel the less
intelligent audience...

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.600
...would not be able
to comprehend the moods,

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.280
...the changes in mood.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.040
Therefore we underline
those changes those moods...

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.840
by means of background music.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.080
But even so I would say I use
music as discreetly as possible.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:30.240
Ray's musical genius finds its
brilliant expression in the lyrics...

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.000
...and tunes he
composed for his films.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.280
My first original lyric
was written for "Devi".

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.040
But the tune was not my own...

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.840
...it was based on the
conventional Ramprasadi tune.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.600
The words were my own.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.400
I shall wander house to
house asking for alms to survive.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.840
But I shall never come back
to you calling you oh! Mother.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:02.600
Mother, I shall not call you mother
henceforth as you have given me...

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.280
...and you are still
giving me such torments.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.440
Mother, I shall not call you mother.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.120
But my first original song
both lyric and tune and...

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.200
...orchestration was
for "Chiriyakhana".

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.440
This was the song
"Bhalobasha tumi ki jaano"...

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.520
...which is supposed to
occur in an old Bengali film.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.840
With legs placed one on the other.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.480
An open book of accounts and
engrossed in your own thoughts.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.520
I keep saying that its dawn but
you don't seem to listen to me.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.000
What is it that you know of love?

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:05.600
Then I got
interested in writing songs...

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.280
...and found an
opportunity to write songs.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.240
When I decided to make a film...

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.520
...of my grandfather's
short story "Gupi Gaayin".

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.800
Based on
Upendrakishore Raichoudhary's story

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.680
Gupi Gaayin Baagha Baayin

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.720
Gupi's Character Tapan Chatterjee

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.120
Baagha's Character Ravi Ghosh

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.640
Other Characters

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.600

Preeti Majumdar, Shailaig Ganguly,
Mani Shreemani.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.840
It became an elaborate musical film,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.440
...and for it I wrote about...

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.400
...seven or eight or nine songs.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.640
I started by writing
some of the songs...

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.560
...even before I wrote the scenario,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.440
I imagined some of the situations...

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.080
...that would occur in the film and...

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.520
...I wanted to find out...

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.160
...whether I could be able
to compose songs for the film.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.000
I wrote three or four as a try out...

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.760
...and when it turned out that...

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.440
...they were quite satisfactory
I decided to make the film.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.080
Emperor, we salute you

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.720
We come from the country of Bengal

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.240
We come from the country of Bengal

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.400
We are simple living men...

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.880
...who wander off to
different kingdom.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.960
We are simple living men...

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.920
...who wander off to
different kingdom.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.040
Our language is different and
we do not know your language.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:39.040
Our language is different and
we do not know your language.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.760
Oh Emperor...

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.680
Mr. Emperor.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.080
But we know a different language

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.720
...and we feel
satisfied to sing for you...

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.080
...as we come for that.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.040
King, Oh Emperor.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:33.720
We sing in that same language
We sing in that same language

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.120
Oh mighty King listen to our
song to your hearts satisfaction.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.160
It is the language of rhythm,
the language of rhyme,

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.840
the language of tempo,
the language of joy.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.080
The language spoken is such
that it is understood by all.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.880
The language spoken is such
that it is understood by all...

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.320
rich or poor big or
small all are the same.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.400
Rich or poor big or
small all are the same...

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.280
...so I sing in this language,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.880
So I sing in this language,

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.680
I sing the song.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.680
Oh! Emperor my salute to you.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.000
"Hirak Rajar Deshe" 1980

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.680
Sing...

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.920
Where is the song?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.400
Sa Re Ga
- Ga Ga Ga

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.320
We are finished

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.680
Sa Ga Ma Ga

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.920
Where is the song?

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.560
I beg of you

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.440
I beg of you Tiger uncle
Please do not be annoyed uncle.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.080
Who would have known that
you would be in the room?

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.720
You in this room Room.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.640
Who would have known that
you would be in the room?

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.000
It is like having lightening
without having any clouds.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.720
Lightening without clouds
The work being almost done

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.400
Lightening without clouds
The work being almost done

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.720
For havens sake please be calm Uncle.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.080
Who would have known that
you would be in the room

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:34.200
If my neck, if ever my
neck is attacked by your paws.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:47.160
oh my oh my, if ever my
neck is attacked by your paws.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.400
I know what shall happen to me.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.240
Two fresh lives will be
lost forever Fresh 2 live.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:11.280
Will be lost I know two
fresh lives will be lost.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.840
Who would have known that
you would be in the room

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.280
Brother Baagha, tell me how
many diamonds have you taken

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.640
Do we have time for that genius.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.840
Still I would like to
know how many you have taken

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.040
I have taken enough

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.360
Then there is no need
to take any more

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.960
No need to take any more
come now let's run away

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.920
Come now let's run away

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.640
We've achieved the
goal with great difficulty

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.480
That's more than enough
That's more than enough

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.160
His latest experiment
in music in Ghare Baire.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.800
Like Tagore in his songs and...

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.440
...Ravi Shankar in
his instrumental music,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.440
Ray has blended western and
Indian elements to create...

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:30.640
...his own distinctive musical
form and he has succeeded where...

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.960
...others have
failed in Indian cinema.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.480
H M V Recording studio

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.080
One two three four

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.200
The fifth key has a vibrar
key note... there watch out

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.960
Number 5
- 8...

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.440
...Ma dha pa

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.040
On mid note the fifth
note should fall. - Yes.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.440
How will that happen? What yes?
Where are you placing it?

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.120
Number 8 I will place it at eight.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.480
I'm looking at eight itself.
- The one on eight

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.680
There is no getting
away from the fact,

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.800
...that no other film
director in India...

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.440
...has demonstrated the same
command of film music as Ray.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.000
Rays music is
imaginative not melodramatic,

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:29.280
balanced not exuberant,
functional not decorative.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.560
It is music that grows
from the film itself.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.760
It seems, that Indian cinema is
not prepared yet, to adopt,...

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.120
...the language of Ray's music.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.480
Stop!

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.320
Its okay.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.560
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, continue
playing for every piece.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.640
It has been my intention right
from the beginning to work...

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.520
...as an independent composer.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.880
not in opposition with other
professional composers in music...

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:09.560
...but only for my own pleasure,
I do it because I love doing it.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.520
I love composing songs, I love
composing background music and...

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.920
...that is what I have been
doing with one or two exceptions...

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.240
...I have worked for one
or two other composers.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.160
Other directors in other films...

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.040
...such as well for
instance Shakespeare Voila.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.480
But as a rule and...

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.080
...this is going to be a rule
not only for now for future also...

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.360
...I shall work only for myself.
