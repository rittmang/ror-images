WEBVTT

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:21.055
It's been a year now, Singhji.

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.495
Aren't you over it yet?

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.845
Hasn't the wound healed?

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:32.116
Who says it hasn't?

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:38.005
There's no need for words,
you're not what you were.

00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:43.714
You're a warrior's son -you have
the blood of Pratap Singh in your veins.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:48.838
- That's just the trouble.
- How do you mean?

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:55.202
That blood won't let me
accept betrayal.

00:00:56.084 --> 00:01:01.839
If one wife has left you,
then get yourself another.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.352
- Why not?
- That one will run away, too.

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:11.537
I've had enough of them.

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:17.910
She left because she wanted money.
If you had money, she'd have stayed.

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:24.745
Mr. Budha's monopoly service
ruined your business.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.722
That's why she left you.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.662
Yes... I suppose you're right.

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.773
Let's shake on it.

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:41.376
Fifty-fifty partners.
Singh-Naskar and Company.

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:46.435
You're a champion driver,
I'm a champion mechanic.

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:50.213
Let's see which bastard can beat us.

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:54.444
You know how tough it is
on your own.

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:58.280
Then one day
you'll stab me in the back?

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.962
How do I know you're not a bastard?

00:02:03.048 --> 00:02:05.654
Whatever gave you that idea?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.261
Just because your ancestors
fought on horseback...

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:13.665
does that make you a nobleman?

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.528
You're just a driver,
I'm just a driver.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.147
You have a Chrysler,
I have a Chevrolet...

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.571
but we both carry passengers.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:29.960
No. No partnership.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.289
All these bastards are cheats.

00:02:35.513 --> 00:02:39.193
Think it over
once you've calmed down.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:43.038
Get in. Mind the step.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:47.724
(indistinct)

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.922
Mind your veil.

00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:55.331
- No springs poking out of the seats?
- Grandpa, you hurt my feelings.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:59.194
(indistinct)

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:03.487
Hey!

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.897
We're not going.

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:11.207
- Come on!
- What the heck?

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:14.411
- Not going?
- This car is going nowhere.

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:18.944
- No women in my car, I said
- But she's a bride, Singhji.

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:25.328
If I complain to the police.
You won't be a taxi driver for long.

00:03:25.353 --> 00:03:28.817
What if we miss our train?

00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:34.763
I'll take you there, come on.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.388
ABHIJAN (The Expedition)

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:07.079
Do you think we'll catch the train?

00:05:07.178 --> 00:05:10.028
Ask Singhji.

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.494
Will we catch it?

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:17.838
- How should I know?
- It's your car. You ought to know.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.634
- It's in God's hands.
- But the wheel is in your hands.

00:05:24.514 --> 00:05:26.636
I said it's in God's hands

00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:29.422
You heard what Singhji said?

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:30.617
Accident?

00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:32.015
And accidents?

00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:11.770
Address him with respect.
If he gets mad, his hand starts shaking.

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:13.786
Really?

00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:17.575
Have you seen Vyjayanthimala dance?
That's how the car will move.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.070
Faster!

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:52.499
Get in quick! Hurry!

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:55.623
Get in quickly!

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.621
Isn't that train we supposed to go?

00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:09.965
- Yes...
- Yes, indeed.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.254
That's the train.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:17.615
Do you think we have a chance now?

00:08:20.358 --> 00:08:23.426
Good bye!

00:08:24.427 --> 00:08:32.427
(reading English)

00:09:08.323 --> 00:09:09.775
A crank start?

00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:18.419
You drive.

00:09:18.904 --> 00:09:20.396
Really?

00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:22.786
I'll take a nap

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:50.854
<i>Some call me wild</i>

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:53.690
<i>Let them call me what they want</i>

00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:08.433
(honking)

00:10:08.977 --> 00:10:11.663
Why are you tooting?

00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:14.754
- He won't let me pass.
- Who?

00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:16.889
It's Mr Budha.

00:10:19.448 --> 00:10:20.528
What?

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:31.118
The bastard! Stop the car.

00:10:31.142 --> 00:10:33.142
- Sure?
- Yes, stop the car.

00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:42.428
Move across.

00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:17.285
(honking)

00:11:17.382 --> 00:11:20.387
- Who's that behind us?
- One of our taxis.

00:11:22.152 --> 00:11:26.564
- What insolence
- He doesn't realize you're with me.

00:11:39.572 --> 00:11:41.626
You want a monopoly service?

00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:58.243
- How long have you worked here?
- Four years, sir.

00:11:58.341 --> 00:12:02.338
You'll find another place.
I have canceled your license.

00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:06.417
- Why is that?
- You know why!

00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:10.799
You think you're doing circus stunts
with your car!

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.583
Overtaking like that!

00:12:13.626 --> 00:12:18.036
- Sir, I didn't realize you...
- It makes no difference.

00:12:18.393 --> 00:12:22.226
In my district
you don't put people's lives at risk

00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:26.478
Sir, just this once...

00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:28.971
Shut up. I won't hear another word.

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:33.688
- I admit I was wrong, sir. My job...
- Shut up!

00:13:04.052 --> 00:13:05.180
Get out!

00:13:09.644 --> 00:13:10.653
(banging)

00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:12.297
Singh ji!

00:13:12.343 --> 00:13:17.716
- Don't hit her.
- Why not? She messed up my job.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.740
(indistinct)

00:13:30.504 --> 00:13:33.403
- It's your fault, too.
- My fault? What did I do?

00:13:33.428 --> 00:13:36.675
Couldn't you see who was in the car?
Are you blind?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.629
How could I? Even you...

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:55.731
They never let you stand on your feet

00:13:56.908 --> 00:14:02.668
And if you do, they knock you down,
break your legs.

00:14:03.681 --> 00:14:08.192
They will force you to stop your service
and will take away the permit.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.802
They've taken away the permit?

00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:22.791
For a moment I felt like falling
at his feet...

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.169
but my heart stopped me.

00:14:26.103 --> 00:14:27.440
What stopped you?

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.032
Blood. The blood flowing in my veins.

00:14:36.227 --> 00:14:41.764
I am of the warrior caste.
Narsingh, falling at his feet.

00:14:47.008 --> 00:14:50.990
Not possible for me,
simly I can't.

00:14:53.785 --> 00:14:55.696
Here, start up.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.943
Not anymore.

00:15:00.078 --> 00:15:05.113
Let's go home to Giribraja.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.983
- Hey, Rama!
- Hmm?

00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:56.600
- Are you asleep, Rama?
- No, Singhji.

00:15:59.107 --> 00:16:04.295
There isn't a worse job in the world
than being a driver, is there?

00:16:04.393 --> 00:16:05.539
No, Singhji.

00:16:44.785 --> 00:16:46.609
Stop!

00:16:48.294 --> 00:16:52.201
Please, stop!

00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:55.287
Stop!

00:16:57.117 --> 00:17:00.154
- Are you going to Shyamnagar?
- No. Why?

00:17:00.256 --> 00:17:03.456
I'd be so grateful
if you could take me.

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:04.801
This isn't a taxi.

00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:06.910
I'm asking for your help.

00:17:07.016 --> 00:17:09.801
The stupid driver overturned the cart,
our luggage...

00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:13.732
I said this isn't a taxi,
it's a private car.

00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:16.743
- I'll make it worth your while
- What do you mean?

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.760
Twenty rupees.

00:17:18.824 --> 00:17:20.078
Twenty-five!

00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:22.164
- Twenty-five!
- Agreed.

00:17:25.594 --> 00:17:31.069
You idiot! I'll break your bones!

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.650
(indistinct)

00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:36.927
Gulabi!

00:17:37.343 --> 00:17:39.582
Is she going as well?

00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:42.745
Yes. No one else, just her.

00:17:42.838 --> 00:17:44.224
No, not possible.

00:17:44.249 --> 00:17:47.279
Rama, leave the luggage. Let's go.

00:17:47.304 --> 00:17:49.392
But why? She's my new maid.

00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:51.478
It will cost you double.

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:58.413
I'll pay. By the grace of God,
Sukhanram is not short of money.

00:17:59.034 --> 00:18:03.985
- Half in advance
- Of course. And five extra.

00:18:04.672 --> 00:18:06.168
Hold this!

00:18:27.672 --> 00:18:32.762
Driver, how much does your car cost?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.312
- Ten thousand!
- Huh?

00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:38.555
Ten thousand?

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:45.309
Really, huh?

00:18:51.638 --> 00:18:56.826
Singhji, look to your right.
Those are the rocks of Shyamnagar.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.361
Watchman! Hariya!

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:20.117
Open the gate!

00:19:34.344 --> 00:19:35.977
That's enough.

00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:49.226
Take the luggage, Hariya.

00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:54.243
What about my money?
Messing up my plans.

00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:55.859
Money?

00:19:58.353 --> 00:20:03.596
I'll give you your money.
Come in for five minutes.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:06.607
- Have a drink
- What sort of drink?

00:20:06.714 --> 00:20:10.767
You did me a big favour.
Now come inside.

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:20.039
Take her inside.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:39.248
Where are you?

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:52.930
I won't give you twenty.
I'll give you...

00:20:53.727 --> 00:20:59.449
One, two, three, four five...

00:21:01.358 --> 00:21:02.734
Here. Fifty.

00:21:06.155 --> 00:21:07.881
Yes, maybe...

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.804
I could help you start a taxi service
from Shyamnagar to Panchmati

00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:17.755
There's no taxi service here.

00:21:20.228 --> 00:21:22.532
Why would you make it easy for me?

00:21:23.546 --> 00:21:28.919
I have a business.
Deliveries, tobacco and stuff.

00:21:40.651 --> 00:21:44.713
A car will come in handy for me.

00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:47.447
You saw what happens with an ox cart.

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:52.403
That's why I suggest you stay here.

00:21:52.701 --> 00:21:55.868
I'll arrange a place for you.

00:21:55.968 --> 00:22:01.920
And if your car needs any repairs,
I'll pay for that, too.

00:22:03.784 --> 00:22:07.464
Get a permit and start a taxi service.

00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:12.524
Once you start making some money,
you can repay my loan bit by bit.

00:22:12.968 --> 00:22:18.091
When you're up and running,
you can deliver some goods for me.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:23.280
Simple as that. No inconvenience,
no problem, nothing.

00:22:25.592 --> 00:22:27.432
- Would you need this?
- Huh?

00:22:27.818 --> 00:22:29.087
The lighter!

00:22:39.231 --> 00:22:40.308
Take it.

00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:50.842
You don't have to answer right away.
Take your time, think it over.

00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:57.608
Stay here today and look around,
see what the roads are like.

00:22:57.706 --> 00:23:01.190
See how many other cars there are.

00:23:01.294 --> 00:23:04.613
Make a few trial trips to Panchmati.

00:23:04.722 --> 00:23:09.713
Then come back and tell me
your decision in the evening.

00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:15.996
But I can tell you,
this is a nice place.

00:23:16.606 --> 00:23:21.597
The water's good, you'll have a good
appetite, you'll get strong.

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:25.659
Well, Singhji?

00:23:27.972 --> 00:23:29.981
I'll think it over.

00:23:31.922 --> 00:23:34.893
Have a drink before you go.

00:23:49.807 --> 00:23:51.598
Look at that.

00:24:09.628 --> 00:24:14.339
- Who does he think he is?
- Wouldn't you show off such a car?

00:24:14.364 --> 00:24:16.174
What's so special about it?

00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:20.887
Even a dead elephant
is worth a fortune.

00:24:20.912 --> 00:24:24.304
It's not just the car, but the look.

00:24:24.328 --> 00:24:27.982
Hey, give me a cup of tea!

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:37.251
A cup of tea.

00:24:40.721 --> 00:24:43.463
- What did you pay for this?
- Two rupees.

00:24:52.235 --> 00:24:54.408
A cup of tea, quick.

00:24:56.626 --> 00:25:00.590
He looks like the warrior
Shivaji's descendant.

00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:03.139
Nitai, come and take a look!

00:25:03.744 --> 00:25:09.248
- Have you never seen a car before?
- It's King George V's private taxi.

00:25:16.425 --> 00:25:17.889
Chrysler.

00:25:19.857 --> 00:25:22.287
- I mean your car.
- Yes, I know...

00:25:24.496 --> 00:25:26.538
Is that your car?

00:25:28.957 --> 00:25:32.626
- Do you just drive it, or...
- It's my car and I drive it.

00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:40.757
- A 1931 model?
- 1930.

00:25:40.864 --> 00:25:42.622
Give me a tea, quickly.

00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:15.453
Brother, where are my glasses?

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:20.042
Are you starting a taxi service?

00:26:21.787 --> 00:26:24.725
- Why?
- Just wondering.

00:26:28.482 --> 00:26:32.861
- Are there other taxis here?
- No, that's all we have.

00:26:39.245 --> 00:26:41.156
You'll do well.

00:26:41.771 --> 00:26:43.825
Do you expect to get something out of it?

00:26:44.794 --> 00:26:49.021
Why should I? I drive the
Sub-Divisional Officer's jeep.

00:26:49.419 --> 00:26:55.458
Where are you from?
I mean, are you a Bengali?

00:26:55.833 --> 00:26:58.634
No, I'm from Giribraja.

00:27:00.407 --> 00:27:05.606
What? Are you...

00:27:07.122 --> 00:27:10.825
Are you one of the Giribraja Singhs?
Your name...

00:27:10.974 --> 00:27:12.536
Do you know them?

00:27:12.575 --> 00:27:17.379
Do I know them?
Have you heard of Prankrishna Das?

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.341
A friend of your grandfather.
He was my grandfather.

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:26.695
My father settled here
25 years ago.

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.142
Wasn't he a Christian?

00:27:31.283 --> 00:27:33.283
Oh, I see!

00:27:33.845 --> 00:27:37.487
What an extraordinary coincidence.

00:27:37.512 --> 00:27:42.999
Lucky for me. I was hoping to find
out something about this place.

00:27:43.024 --> 00:27:47.481
I know. Come home with me.

00:27:47.506 --> 00:27:50.492
It's not far.
Behind the Uncle and Nephew rocks.

00:27:50.517 --> 00:27:53.012
- Behind what?
- Didn't you see the rocks?

00:27:53.037 --> 00:27:55.810
I saw some on the way in.

00:27:55.826 --> 00:28:00.497
Let's walk home.
We can see the rocks on the way.

00:28:00.521 --> 00:28:03.077
- I'll pay.
- How kind of you...

00:28:03.102 --> 00:28:07.526
I'm two months older than you.
My mother told me.

00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:17.220
Rama, watch the car.

00:28:17.318 --> 00:28:19.459
Sly foxes!

00:28:21.662 --> 00:28:23.662
Do you know what is that?

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:28.027
Father Wilkins. He used
to frighten us by saying...

00:28:43.717 --> 00:28:45.409
Just think...

00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:49.793
All the sins of Shyamnagar
are on top of that rock.

00:29:03.702 --> 00:29:04.782
Come!

00:29:28.901 --> 00:29:32.682
Does it look like a village
in Bengal?

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.772
I wish I could race a horse here.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:53.565
They say your grandfather
was a great rider. Do you ride, too?

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.010
More than one horse.

00:30:01.915 --> 00:30:03.975
- Twenty-six
- Really?

00:30:04.072 --> 00:30:09.908
Haven't you seen my Chrysler?
Twenty-six horsepower.

00:30:12.111 --> 00:30:13.157
Come this way.

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:23.306
Take a look there!

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:30.767
As children, we wrote our names
on the rocks. They're still there.

00:30:35.806 --> 00:30:41.251
- J. R?
- I'm Joseph Rajani Das.

00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:44.854
- And the other name?
- My sister.

00:30:50.589 --> 00:30:57.299
- Are you back already?
- Recognise him?

00:31:07.414 --> 00:31:11.794
- You don't recognize him?
- Not really.

00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:16.641
Uncle Madhab's son Narsingh,
from Giribraja.

00:31:17.343 --> 00:31:19.287
He's starting a taxi service.

00:31:19.394 --> 00:31:24.462
It's so long since I saw him,
and my eyes aren't what they were.

00:31:24.487 --> 00:31:27.104
He arrived yesterday.

00:31:27.129 --> 00:31:30.589
How kind of you to grace our home.

00:31:30.614 --> 00:31:33.480
- Where's Neeli?
- Indoors.

00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:35.504
- Neeli?
- <i>Coming...</i>

00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:40.978
Sit. This was father's chair.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.534
Ma, give Singhji some of the cake
that Neeli made.

00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:48.097
Sit down.

00:31:52.933 --> 00:31:57.061
Christmas decorations
we haven't taken down yet.

00:31:59.371 --> 00:32:04.045
Stay. It's as good a place as any
to start a taxi service.

00:32:04.144 --> 00:32:08.687
I've worked for the SDO for four years.
He'll give you a permit.

00:32:09.301 --> 00:32:13.778
What about the other people?
The drivers?

00:32:13.881 --> 00:32:16.054
They're troublemakers, aren't they?

00:32:17.265 --> 00:32:21.741
Same as everywhere.
Trouble at first, then everything's fine.

00:32:25.016 --> 00:32:29.877
You're all right, but if you were Christian
I'd advise you not to stay.

00:32:30.618 --> 00:32:35.543
- Do they get at you?
- Not me, I use my fists if need be.

00:32:37.697 --> 00:32:41.475
But my sister,
she has to go to school.

00:32:42.751 --> 00:32:47.815
- Mary Neelima, this is...
- I overheard everything.

00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:58.125
She'll help you fill out your permit
application in her lovely handwriting.

00:32:59.425 --> 00:33:01.391
- In English?
- Of course!

00:33:02.066 --> 00:33:04.686
She passed her matric.
She teaches at the school.

00:33:04.788 --> 00:33:07.311
Why not show him
some of your books?

00:33:07.335 --> 00:33:09.522
(indistinct)

00:33:09.757 --> 00:33:11.264
See this!

00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:18.648
This is very good.

00:33:19.795 --> 00:33:22.099
Will you stay here?

00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:24.545
I'm trying to persuade him to stay.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:28.820
My son asked me to bring you a cake,
but I'm not sure if you would like to eat.

00:33:28.844 --> 00:33:34.640
Keep it!

00:33:36.008 --> 00:33:41.862
How can I persuade you? We were
low caste, but now we are Christians.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.094
I never thought about that.

00:33:50.547 --> 00:33:53.966
As Neeli had made cake...

00:34:06.696 --> 00:34:08.453
Sit down and eat.

00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:16.299
You should stay here tonight.

00:34:16.323 --> 00:34:17.469
Here?

00:34:18.472 --> 00:34:23.370
Why not? It's no trouble for me.

00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:30.286
And I have something new for you.

00:34:30.311 --> 00:34:32.981
Especially for you.

00:34:33.161 --> 00:34:36.361
- Is it?
- Hey, Hariya?

00:34:40.418 --> 00:34:44.278
The car will take you back
in the morning.

00:34:44.364 --> 00:34:46.533
So you have a car now?

00:34:46.637 --> 00:34:51.278
When my back was hurt last night...

00:34:51.377 --> 00:34:55.571
I thought I was being punished
for my sins.

00:34:56.951 --> 00:35:01.877
But God works in mysterious ways.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:08.096
He did not forget my good deeds.

00:35:08.194 --> 00:35:11.547
A taxi appeared out of the blue.

00:35:12.198 --> 00:35:16.872
And with it, an expert driver.

00:35:17.771 --> 00:35:21.899
He covered a distance of 80 miles
in two hours.

00:35:23.858 --> 00:35:28.139
I decided to keep him. In my trade...

00:35:28.246 --> 00:35:31.544
Come in, Singhji.

00:35:31.988 --> 00:35:36.436
I can tell from the dust
that you've been to Panchmati.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.753
Yes!

00:35:38.045 --> 00:35:42.435
- How did you like it?
- The roads are bad.

00:35:42.576 --> 00:35:44.794
I know that.

00:35:44.826 --> 00:35:48.630
But I also know they'll be repaired
within the year.

00:35:48.655 --> 00:35:50.811
How much you need?
I'll pay that tomorrow.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.423
Come in. Lift your veil.

00:36:37.478 --> 00:36:45.478
(indistinct)

00:36:58.768 --> 00:37:00.807
Singhji, hello!

00:37:00.831 --> 00:37:08.234
(indistinct)

00:37:09.338 --> 00:37:13.463
Abhimanyu appeared for an action.

00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:18.740
- Did Abhimanyu have a beard?
- Sure he did.

00:37:18.765 --> 00:37:23.780
You don't know anything.
He died when he was sixteen.

00:37:23.805 --> 00:37:26.179
A beard? By magic?

00:37:26.204 --> 00:37:29.679
No, that was Abhimanyu's father.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.936
And that is Abhimanyu.

00:37:48.187 --> 00:37:52.981
How was it... the trip to Panchmati?

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.358
Good.

00:37:57.027 --> 00:38:01.071
So you're working without a license?

00:38:01.096 --> 00:38:03.551
How long does a licence take?

00:38:03.576 --> 00:38:06.005
He has a Jack in his hand.

00:38:06.296 --> 00:38:07.277
What Jack?

00:38:07.302 --> 00:38:11.784
Yes, a Jack. Can't you read English?

00:38:11.809 --> 00:38:15.341
J for Joseph.

00:38:15.446 --> 00:38:18.548
And K for Christian.

00:38:36.045 --> 00:38:40.108
- How much did he take?
- Nothing.

00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:43.726
Liked your face?

00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:46.895
Yes!

00:38:48.362 --> 00:38:51.729
He'll get me the licence, too.

00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:57.389
Good night!

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:13.317
My jaws are aching. The Imambazar
restaurant was much better.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:21.004
- You don't like anything here.
- The people here aren't decent.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.076
- Which people?
- The drivers.

00:39:26.444 --> 00:39:28.861
They're jealous, of the Chrysler.

00:39:28.958 --> 00:39:31.047
Of course, they'll be jealous.

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:37.761
I compete with them,
why should they welcome me?

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:43.370
That bus driver threw tea at you,
the devil.

00:39:45.297 --> 00:39:50.966
So what? Remember how it was
when we started in Imambazar?

00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:54.903
They calmed down.

00:39:58.712 --> 00:40:00.712
No one can beat me
as I am a warrior's son.

00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:03.935
Do you know the Christian from before?

00:40:06.234 --> 00:40:08.309
He's from Giribraja.

00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:11.393
A low caste, he became a Christian.

00:40:12.428 --> 00:40:13.428
I know that.

00:40:13.486 --> 00:40:17.199
But he seems to have forgotten,
mixing with you like that.

00:40:17.618 --> 00:40:22.674
He drives for the SDO.
He'll help get me a permit quickly.

00:40:24.556 --> 00:40:29.983
And the old businessman?
He's a snake.

00:40:31.433 --> 00:40:33.890
- What do you know about him?
- I know.

00:40:33.995 --> 00:40:36.364
- I've been told.
- Who told?

00:40:36.388 --> 00:40:37.517
(honking)

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:38.832
That girl.

00:40:45.758 --> 00:40:48.149
Bring me some more bread.

00:41:03.472 --> 00:41:07.917
Which girl? Which girl told you?

00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:10.925
The one he said was his maid.

00:41:11.478 --> 00:41:12.980
You've been talking to her?

00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:19.223
She came to the well for water.
She's nice. I told her all about you.

00:41:19.324 --> 00:41:23.070
- What did you say?
- She asked about you.

00:41:23.168 --> 00:41:26.073
She's a bitch, a bad woman.

00:41:26.656 --> 00:41:28.609
- No, she just...
- Shut up!

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:32.055
Talk to her again
and I'll kick you out.

00:41:32.587 --> 00:41:36.503
Stick to your job, don't worry
about who is good, who is bad.

00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:38.217
Okay.

00:42:52.004 --> 00:42:54.690
Will you be able to sleep here?

00:42:54.714 --> 00:42:55.838
Why?

00:42:55.863 --> 00:43:02.308
So much stuff,
there's a horrible stink.

00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:09.034
- You'll sleep here, too.
- I'll sleep in the Chrysler.

00:43:09.058 --> 00:43:11.058
Why there?

00:43:11.576 --> 00:43:14.578
To make sure no one steals any parts.

00:43:17.101 --> 00:43:25.101
(reading English)

00:43:45.532 --> 00:43:48.938
<i>Gulabi?</i>

00:44:04.446 --> 00:44:07.781
<i>Gulabi!
Whare are you?</i>

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.712
(knock on door)

00:44:37.813 --> 00:44:39.854
Who is it?

00:44:41.785 --> 00:44:43.543
Rama?

00:45:05.696 --> 00:45:07.641
What are you doing here?

00:45:07.946 --> 00:45:11.146
Let me stay, just for the night.

00:45:12.344 --> 00:45:13.344
What?

00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:15.782
I beg you.

00:45:17.213 --> 00:45:19.853
- They'll kill me.
- Who?

00:45:20.565 --> 00:45:24.180
The new fellow, he will dishonour me.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.193
Dishonour?

00:45:26.885 --> 00:45:28.322
Look at this!

00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:43.381
What can I do about it?

00:45:43.405 --> 00:45:46.824
No, you can't stay here.

00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:52.338
You've ruined my sleep. Go away.

00:45:52.439 --> 00:45:54.995
I won't do anything, sir.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.728
I'll sit in the corner...

00:45:57.753 --> 00:45:59.771
What does that mean"?

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.248
What do you take me for?

00:46:10.027 --> 00:46:13.708
I'm a warrior caste. Do you know that?

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:19.921
Women for us are...
Go away!

00:46:22.976 --> 00:46:24.312
All right, sir.

00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:30.788
<i>Gulabi...?</i>

00:46:37.093 --> 00:46:41.343
<i>Gulabi...?</i>

00:46:42.218 --> 00:46:43.367
Hey, you!

00:46:47.939 --> 00:46:51.923
If you want to stay,
stay in the corner.

00:46:58.008 --> 00:47:01.656
If they come looking for you,
I'll throw you out.

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.211
Shall I shut the door?

00:47:08.862 --> 00:47:10.000
Yes.

00:47:25.417 --> 00:47:29.032
- With this, too?
- Yes.

00:48:16.879 --> 00:48:18.167
It's cold.

00:48:26.073 --> 00:48:29.305
- Can I say something?
- Again?

00:48:32.433 --> 00:48:35.066
My name is Gulabi.

00:48:38.355 --> 00:48:41.204
I'm Rana Pratap Singh.

00:49:37.538 --> 00:49:40.890
I recognised your horn.
What have you decided?

00:49:42.756 --> 00:49:45.378
- I might as well stay.
- Very well.

00:49:46.068 --> 00:49:48.951
I thought so. I have a plan.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.518
The jeep will break down tomorrow.

00:49:52.623 --> 00:49:56.882
You'll take the SDO to Panchmati
in your Chrysler.

00:49:56.979 --> 00:50:00.812
Pick him up at 7:30.
On the way, you discuss your permit.

00:50:00.919 --> 00:50:02.830
- And you?
- I'll be there.

00:50:02.937 --> 00:50:07.065
I'll introduce you,
then go to get the jeep repaired.

00:50:08.268 --> 00:50:10.268
(indistinct)

00:50:10.293 --> 00:50:12.293
- Good morning!
- Morning!

00:50:12.385 --> 00:50:14.855
- Where are you going?
- To the school.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.083
Where is your school?

00:50:17.419 --> 00:50:21.614
- Have you seen the church?
- Not yet.

00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:25.708
- It's near the church.
- I'll take you in the car.

00:50:25.733 --> 00:50:30.546
- Don't trouble yourself.
- Your brother is coming along.

00:50:31.268 --> 00:50:33.922
I offered to give her a lift.

00:50:34.023 --> 00:50:39.882
Yes, you've never driven
in such a car.

00:50:50.115 --> 00:50:55.153
- What happened?
- It's my fault, I didn't see the tear.

00:50:56.169 --> 00:50:58.169
A monkey did it.

00:50:58.924 --> 00:51:01.650
I swear!

00:51:01.861 --> 00:51:03.415
Start up!

00:51:12.208 --> 00:51:15.332
- How long have you had the car?
- About four years.

00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:18.771
Brother's never given me a lift.

00:51:18.903 --> 00:51:22.681
Never mind, I'll take you out.

00:51:24.124 --> 00:51:29.497
A jeep's not much fun, anyway.
You'll see how this car runs.

00:51:30.259 --> 00:51:32.170
I can.

00:51:32.462 --> 00:51:36.082
If you want to go anywhere, tell me.

00:51:41.047 --> 00:51:43.966
Can you stop for a minute?

00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:55.886
I didn't realize it was you.
Here is your book.

00:51:57.461 --> 00:52:00.334
Singhji kindly gave me a lift.

00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:02.418
This is Mr Ajoy.

00:52:02.442 --> 00:52:04.895
- Greetings!
- Good morning.

00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:06.879
Good morning.

00:52:09.153 --> 00:52:12.003
There's something...

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.623
I can walk from here.

00:52:22.512 --> 00:52:25.810
- Sorry about the seat.
- Never mind.

00:52:25.835 --> 00:52:27.702
See you later.

00:52:37.289 --> 00:52:39.452
What happened to his leg?

00:52:39.477 --> 00:52:44.827
As a boy, he fell from
the Uncle and Nephew rocks.

00:52:45.477 --> 00:52:49.609
He was very mischievous,
but look at him now.

00:52:49.875 --> 00:52:55.150
He spends his time on religion
and studies. He taught Neeli English.

00:52:56.825 --> 00:52:58.737
He is a nice guy.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.588
(indistinct)

00:53:20.409 --> 00:53:25.203
- Your car runs beautifully.
- Only the seat is rotten.

00:53:25.626 --> 00:53:29.064
(indistinct)

00:53:33.635 --> 00:53:35.547
How it gleams.

00:53:48.511 --> 00:53:51.651
- Are you staying with Sukhanram?
- Yes!

00:53:51.886 --> 00:53:55.495
You gave him a lift
when his cart overturned?

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.593
How do you know?

00:53:58.527 --> 00:54:00.471
I heard about it.

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.893
- You didn't know him before, did you?
- No!

00:54:09.802 --> 00:54:12.522
- What's wrong?
- Nothing serious...

00:54:13.668 --> 00:54:17.223
I don't know if I should tell you.

00:54:17.248 --> 00:54:19.858
But if you stay here,
you're bound to find out.

00:54:20.709 --> 00:54:24.193
- People say lots about him.
- Such as?

00:54:24.218 --> 00:54:28.776
He runs rackets. His house
has been searched a few times.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.489
They once found opium there
in some ghee tins.

00:54:32.591 --> 00:54:35.693
And there was a scandal about women.

00:54:35.795 --> 00:54:41.780
He takes girls from villages, uses them,
then sells them off.

00:54:44.668 --> 00:54:49.462
I thought it best to warn you,
you might run into trouble.

00:55:02.793 --> 00:55:05.927
- Which car is this?
- A Chrysler.

00:55:06.645 --> 00:55:08.054
Have you put in an application?

00:55:08.863 --> 00:55:11.301
Not yet, sir.

00:55:11.326 --> 00:55:14.965
Send it to me, I'll see it's granted.

00:55:15.289 --> 00:55:18.842
Get recommendations
from some reputable people.

00:55:19.305 --> 00:55:23.849
The lawyer, the doctor
and a few others.

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:27.943
- Are you a rash driver?
- Not at all, sir.

00:55:28.812 --> 00:55:32.077
Accidents happen
when drivers show off.

00:55:32.102 --> 00:55:36.234
Overtaking right and left,
like circus performers.

00:55:37.227 --> 00:55:40.645
Press the accelerator,
the car goes faster.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:43.664
Where's the valour in that?

00:55:44.227 --> 00:55:45.688
Correct!

00:55:45.937 --> 00:55:49.005
They say life and death
are in God's hands.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.230
But if you run over someone
and he dies...

00:55:52.255 --> 00:55:57.051
is that death in God's hands
or yours?

00:55:57.076 --> 00:55:58.100
Mine, sir

00:55:58.125 --> 00:56:01.510
So how can you say
it's in God's hands?

00:56:01.535 --> 00:56:07.907
God can do as He pleases, but how can
you, a man, have the same right?

00:56:09.018 --> 00:56:12.831
Taxi service! Come on!

00:56:12.855 --> 00:56:20.855
(indistinct)

00:57:25.173 --> 00:57:30.892
(mocking)

00:57:47.092 --> 00:57:50.194
Those children are rascals.

00:57:50.936 --> 00:57:52.847
Many thanks.

00:57:53.402 --> 00:57:55.641
You fell off the rocks?

00:57:55.741 --> 00:58:00.382
Yes, once I was naughty like them.

00:58:01.154 --> 00:58:03.295
That's why God punished me.

00:58:03.397 --> 00:58:08.934
Should naughty children have their
legs broken? It's a matter of luck.

00:58:09.034 --> 00:58:11.491
What's God to do with it?

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:17.639
If they bother you again,
I'll teach them a lesson.

00:58:22.879 --> 00:58:24.911
What's wrong?

00:58:26.395 --> 00:58:28.152
Your car?

00:58:28.177 --> 00:58:32.217
The seat has been repaired.
It won't bother you again.

00:58:33.346 --> 00:58:37.376
- Where are you going?
- To church. It's Sunday.

00:58:45.339 --> 00:58:50.079
Miss Neeli, does your God
punish sinners?

00:58:51.457 --> 00:58:54.428
Of course.

00:58:55.269 --> 00:59:00.511
There's a saying in the Bible:
The wages of sin is death.

00:59:01.195 --> 00:59:03.019
Which means?

00:59:03.117 --> 00:59:06.087
A sinner's punishment is death.

00:59:07.038 --> 00:59:11.124
- So if I sin, I die?
- Yes.

00:59:11.221 --> 00:59:14.486
- And if I don't?
- Then you don't have to die.

00:59:15.493 --> 00:59:19.034
Don't you believe in God?

00:59:19.736 --> 00:59:25.146
Well, if I drive past a temple
or a mosque...

00:59:25.189 --> 00:59:27.075
I make a salaam.

00:59:27.941 --> 00:59:31.557
Don't you pay your respects
to a church?

00:59:31.592 --> 00:59:36.904
Of course, I will do
as you're a Christian.

00:59:39.089 --> 00:59:43.151
Miss Neeli, will you teach me English?

00:59:43.253 --> 00:59:45.427
Me? Why?

00:59:46.398 --> 00:59:52.252
I learned some, I can still read a bit,
but I want to learn it better.

00:59:52.356 --> 00:59:54.530
That's wonderful.

00:59:54.631 --> 00:59:58.279
If you don't know English,
you aren't respected.

00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:03.461
- People think that you're inferior.
- Whoever gave you that idea?

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:07.753
I know that...

01:00:08.888 --> 01:00:11.188
as I work as a driver.

01:00:11.287 --> 01:00:16.114
You're wrong.
My brother is also a driver.

01:00:16.185 --> 01:00:21.528
You own your car, he works for others.
I never consider him inferior.

01:00:22.228 --> 01:00:24.545
- Really?
- Never.

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:27.805
You don't think I'm inferior?

01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:32.674
Why? Behavior determines
whether one is inferior or superior.

01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:37.894
If you acted as an inferior,
I'd think of you as one.

01:00:37.992 --> 01:00:41.541
- So will you teach me English?
- Of course.

01:00:42.669 --> 01:00:45.257
That's our church over there.

01:02:04.665 --> 01:02:12.665
(counting money)

01:02:22.954 --> 01:02:24.384
Your money.

01:02:24.712 --> 01:02:27.333
- Which money?
- The loan.

01:02:29.261 --> 01:02:32.133
What am I to do with this money?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.833
Take it and set me free.

01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:39.932
Free? Have I imprisoned you, Singhji?

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.849
In your debt, I'm not free.

01:02:42.093 --> 01:02:43.132
Singhji, sit down.

01:02:43.273 --> 01:02:44.444
I'm too dusty.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:49.191
What if it's dust or dirt?
Dirt is our business.

01:02:49.295 --> 01:02:52.975
Money is dirt and dirt is money.

01:02:54.581 --> 01:03:00.151
Sit down. You're so tall,
I'll get a stiff neck looking up at you.

01:03:01.174 --> 01:03:05.436
Paramhamsa Dev said it in a Bengali film:

01:03:05.535 --> 01:03:09.847
"Money is dirt and dirt is money".

01:03:09.895 --> 01:03:11.480
What did you want to say?

01:03:12.558 --> 01:03:15.752
What would you do if you were free?

01:03:16.777 --> 01:03:18.737
What I used to do before.

01:03:19.073 --> 01:03:23.818
Is that all?
A taxi driver to a taxi driver.

01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:28.622
Don't you want to do better?
Have your own company?

01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:33.113
A partner in a company,
doesn't that appeal to you?

01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:37.097
You chug along decrepit old roads.

01:03:37.122 --> 01:03:41.075
Some days you make money, some days
you don't. What's special in that?

01:03:41.723 --> 01:03:42.903
Wouldn't you prefer...

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.943
partnership in a transport company?

01:03:45.968 --> 01:03:48.019
I never said I didn't.

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:51.028
Can you start a company on your own?

01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:52.683
Why not?

01:04:00.256 --> 01:04:03.816
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:07.206
How long it took to set up the
Imambazar taxi service?

01:04:07.558 --> 01:04:09.089
About three years.

01:04:09.114 --> 01:04:12.454
What if I made you a partner
in three months?

01:04:16.239 --> 01:04:17.239
What company?

01:04:17.328 --> 01:04:23.181
A new company, a monopoly service,
rock solid.

01:04:23.314 --> 01:04:26.963
Lawyer Mukherjee is in with me.

01:04:28.451 --> 01:04:32.365
How can I be a partner
without the money?

01:04:36.333 --> 01:04:40.754
Is money everything in this world?

01:04:40.778 --> 01:04:46.441
In business, sometimes you need
other things besides money.

01:04:46.704 --> 01:04:52.973
I told the lawyer Singhji
has something special in him.

01:04:53.078 --> 01:04:57.206
And money has nothing to do with it.

01:05:03.328 --> 01:05:05.240
What are you thinking?

01:05:06.094 --> 01:05:08.932
I wonder why you do so much for me.

01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:22.284
- You're warrior caste, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:26.269
Warriors are brave, aren't they?

01:05:26.294 --> 01:05:29.856
They love the idea of an adventure.

01:05:29.974 --> 01:05:32.727
Sometimes they like
take risks, don't they?

01:05:33.437 --> 01:05:34.968
Yes, sometimes.

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:39.210
Okay.

01:06:19.286 --> 01:06:22.005
I'll give you an address.

01:06:22.105 --> 01:06:26.057
Deliver this container for me, that's all.

01:06:27.745 --> 01:06:30.169
Not every day, from time to time.

01:06:30.276 --> 01:06:36.163
Today, then again in a few days,
occasionally.

01:06:37.813 --> 01:06:39.375
What are the risks?

01:06:41.437 --> 01:06:44.434
None, if no one finds out.

01:06:45.445 --> 01:06:49.374
That's all. Now no more questions.

01:06:50.281 --> 01:06:53.034
In a few days, we'll visit my lawyer.

01:06:53.312 --> 01:06:57.677
You'll talk things over,
sign a few papers...

01:06:57.777 --> 01:07:02.919
then within three months
we start our business, that's it.

01:07:02.944 --> 01:07:07.589
Then we'll find you a nice woman,
you'll get married...

01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:15.046
start a family, that's all,
what else is there?

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:18.750
What's in the tin?

01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:21.962
Not ghee.
Any fool knows that much.

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:26.281
If it were,
I'd deliver it myself and say...

01:07:26.306 --> 01:07:31.017
"Here's the ghee,
now fry some chappatis".

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.852
Are the contents illegal?

01:07:36.539 --> 01:07:38.843
Sure, it's illegal.

01:07:39.546 --> 01:07:43.261
Singhji, there's something
you should know.

01:07:43.361 --> 01:07:49.598
Some things are straight, some are
crooked. That's the way of business.

01:07:50.248 --> 01:07:55.851
Any businessman who says
he's always straight is lying.

01:08:00.592 --> 01:08:07.185
When you drive, is the road always
straight, or does it sometimes...

01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:13.513
If you say it's straight,
the deal's off.

01:08:14.389 --> 01:08:16.300
What's my share?

01:08:17.217 --> 01:08:20.120
Full partnership, equal partners.

01:08:33.066 --> 01:08:35.370
Shall I give you the address?

01:08:35.469 --> 01:08:37.927
Will you deliver the tin?

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:41.448
- Let me see the lawyer first.
- Okay, as you wish.

01:08:42.765 --> 01:08:44.538
Singhji...

01:08:56.922 --> 01:08:58.796
Singhji, one more thing.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:03.497
You're a young man,
I understand your needs.

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:08.427
If you want something, tell me.

01:09:08.529 --> 01:09:13.138
I have money and beautiful women.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.662
Very well.

01:09:32.915 --> 01:09:34.826
What do you want?

01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:42.008
- I want to tell you something.
- What is that?

01:09:43.773 --> 01:09:46.008
When you leave from here...

01:09:46.039 --> 01:09:48.568
- Leave for where?
- Home.

01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:52.027
Who said I was leaving?

01:09:53.171 --> 01:09:56.770
An honest man cannot stay here.

01:09:57.413 --> 01:09:59.303
So I am an honest man?

01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:11.784
I spent the night in your room
and you left me alone.

01:10:15.114 --> 01:10:20.250
You aren't just a good man.
You are a god.

01:10:21.403 --> 01:10:24.137
What did you want to say?

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.629
When you leave, take me with you.

01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:35.647
- Nonsense. Where can I take you?
- To your home, where else?

01:10:37.088 --> 01:10:38.277
And then?

01:10:42.316 --> 01:10:48.105
On the way, you can throw me to the
wild dogs. That's better than this.

01:10:58.247 --> 01:11:00.231
<i>Gulabi?</i>

01:11:01.192 --> 01:11:02.965
He's calling you.

01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:05.660
Will you take me with you?

01:11:05.926 --> 01:11:09.285
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

01:11:29.543 --> 01:11:31.454
What a strange world.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.954
An ox cart overturns
and there is an accident...

01:11:48.979 --> 01:11:52.795
and now we're at a circus.

01:11:52.894 --> 01:11:56.917
- Funny, isn't it?
- Lucky for me.

01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:09.949
The day you came home
and ate Neeli's cake...

01:12:09.974 --> 01:12:14.106
I knew I had found a friend at last.

01:12:18.716 --> 01:12:21.589
What I've had to put up with.

01:12:27.268 --> 01:12:32.180
You're a Hindu, I'm a Christian,
he's a Muslim.

01:12:32.205 --> 01:12:36.327
You fast, you eat pork,
you raise chickens.

01:12:36.429 --> 01:12:41.169
Why squabble?
Let's talk about our professions instead.

01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:44.369
We're both drivers,
Rashid Mian is a driver.

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:49.526
All of us get covered with grease
and dirt doing repairs.

01:12:49.964 --> 01:12:52.737
Aren't we all the same?

01:12:52.762 --> 01:12:56.795
Why the question of caste and creed?

01:13:30.977 --> 01:13:34.658
- Do you drink?
- Yes, but not over there.

01:13:36.519 --> 01:13:39.818
Why be scared? I'll be right back.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:49.857
(indistinct)

01:13:51.733 --> 01:13:55.893
- How goes it, Singhji?
- No need to ask him.

01:13:56.654 --> 01:13:59.318
Look at his clothes.

01:13:59.349 --> 01:14:03.826
I'd love a pair of trousers like his.

01:14:03.851 --> 01:14:08.090
Know what you'd have to do?

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:11.128
Hang around with that Christian girl...

01:14:15.456 --> 01:14:17.096
Who said that?

01:14:17.143 --> 01:14:19.251
Don't expect them to tell you.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.102
I said it.

01:14:26.204 --> 01:14:28.204
- I said it.
- No...

01:14:29.003 --> 01:14:30.914
You didn't.

01:14:31.306 --> 01:14:33.380
Why make trouble needlessly?

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:38.158
Needlessly?
Carrying on with that Christian girl.

01:14:40.364 --> 01:14:41.675
What Christian girl?

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:45.389
How many Christian girls do you know?

01:14:45.465 --> 01:14:47.728
You want to know which one?

01:14:47.828 --> 01:14:49.978
The one who carried on
with the lame boy.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:53.303
And now rides in a Chrysler to school.

01:14:56.486 --> 01:14:58.298
Good morning, madam.

01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:04.515
Step outside.

01:15:13.564 --> 01:15:15.650
Hold on to this.

01:15:28.701 --> 01:15:30.751
Damn warrior caste!

01:15:31.275 --> 01:15:32.915
You want to compete?

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:53.013
Narasingh...?

01:16:54.014 --> 01:16:58.795
Rama, help me get him into the car.

01:17:20.661 --> 01:17:25.567
Narasingh...?

01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:34.192
- What happened?
- How do you feel now?

01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:36.518
Don't get up.

01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:40.972
- My car...
- Rama is looking after it, take rest.

01:17:41.399 --> 01:17:43.982
The bastard. The cheat.

01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:48.696
You shouldn't get into a fight.
Look how badly you're hurt.

01:17:49.341 --> 01:17:51.350
Don't mess with such people.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.239
Why did it start so suddenly?

01:17:54.465 --> 01:17:58.426
The bastard said...

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:05.446
that Neeli and the lame boy...

01:18:05.549 --> 01:18:10.619
How often have I asked her
not to go to his house?

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.428
Ma, don't start again.

01:18:13.204 --> 01:18:14.929
I'll say it a hundred times,

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.617
how the neighbours talk about it.

01:18:17.642 --> 01:18:20.886
Tell them Neeli goes there to study.

01:18:20.989 --> 01:18:22.730
He was a brilliant student.

01:18:22.755 --> 01:18:27.014
What good is that?
Can a lame boy earn a living?

01:18:33.218 --> 01:18:34.661
Why are you getting up?

01:18:41.289 --> 01:18:47.192
- I'm going.
- Stay. Have dinner with us.

01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:53.234
I don't feel like eating.

01:18:53.332 --> 01:18:57.932
- How do you feel now?
- Fine. And you?

01:18:57.957 --> 01:18:59.897
They couldn't touch me.

01:19:03.384 --> 01:19:05.845
You were a big help, brother.

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:12.035
Six against one. That's too many,
even for a Singh.

01:19:46.109 --> 01:19:47.943
- Rama...
- Yes, coming.

01:19:56.427 --> 01:19:59.015
- The bastards...
- Carefully...

01:20:05.697 --> 01:20:11.038
Six against one. Otherwise, I would
have taught them a lesson.

01:20:11.143 --> 01:20:16.068
Didn't I tell you not to mess up
with them?

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:20.166
They're jealous...

01:20:21.551 --> 01:20:28.626
They'll be even more jealous
of the company.

01:20:29.969 --> 01:20:30.977
What company?

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:40.790
A bus service, taxis, lorries, trucks.

01:20:42.591 --> 01:20:45.476
- Are you listening?
- Yes, I am.

01:20:55.161 --> 01:20:56.526
What happened?

01:21:05.892 --> 01:21:06.938
Who?

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:14.630
Why?

01:22:31.461 --> 01:22:35.369
Miss Neeli...

01:23:04.403 --> 01:23:05.403
Good morning!

01:23:05.655 --> 01:23:08.375
Feeling better already?

01:23:08.474 --> 01:23:10.298
We're a tough lot.

01:23:11.167 --> 01:23:14.432
- But your eyes...
- Give them a couple of days.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.902
I feel so bad about it.

01:23:23.082 --> 01:23:24.326
Why so?

01:23:26.506 --> 01:23:28.211
It's all because of me.

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:31.009
So what?

01:23:33.183 --> 01:23:36.295
- You've done a lot for me.
- Of course, I will...

01:23:37.995 --> 01:23:40.868
You are my brother's friend.

01:23:42.658 --> 01:23:45.259
I'm your friend, too.

01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:08.256
We'll be off.

01:24:18.714 --> 01:24:19.780
Singhji...

01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:29.070
Yes...

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.365
- Are you my friend?
- Don't you believe me?

01:24:38.465 --> 01:24:41.980
Then can I request something?

01:24:42.171 --> 01:24:46.404
- Yes, of course. Who shall I beat up?
- No beating involved.

01:24:46.683 --> 01:24:47.742
Then?

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.357
- Tell no one, not even my brother.
- I won't say a word.

01:24:57.878 --> 01:25:01.061
Can you meet me tomorrow night
with your car?

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:02.346
Where?

01:25:03.383 --> 01:25:09.613
Somewhere we both know,
but somewhere isolated.

01:25:14.972 --> 01:25:17.141
- Can I suggest?
- Indeed.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:22.444
How about the rocks where you wrote
your names years ago?

01:25:22.842 --> 01:25:24.953
Fine. I'll be there.

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:29.242
- What time?
- 10:00pm.

01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:30.910
Okay.

01:25:31.323 --> 01:25:35.429
- You won't forget?
- I never forget easily.

01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:39.959
Neeli...

01:25:45.056 --> 01:25:47.770
- Can I say something, too?
- Sure.

01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:52.047
Don't tell anyone, not even Joseph.

01:25:52.494 --> 01:25:53.494
Okay.

01:25:54.341 --> 01:25:56.860
I'm going to be a partner
in a company.

01:25:57.236 --> 01:25:58.311
Is it?

01:25:58.312 --> 01:26:01.057
A transport company.
Within three months.

01:26:01.676 --> 01:26:04.819
- You won't feel inferior anymore.
- No.

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:08.364
- Don't messup with those fellows.
- Sure.

01:26:09.577 --> 01:26:12.842
If they speak about me, keep calm.

01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:15.465
I'll try.

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:17.379
And don't drink too much.

01:26:17.429 --> 01:26:19.405
I'll try that, too.

01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:26.465
The bus is about to leave for Panchmati!
Take your seats! Hurry!

01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:29.228
No taxi today.

01:26:29.323 --> 01:26:34.260
- What's happened to Singhji?
- No, idea.

01:26:34.285 --> 01:26:38.800
The car isn't coming today.

01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:41.426
The comfort was different,
it's not so comfortable.

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:45.283
(indistinct)

01:26:56.856 --> 01:27:00.330
Get the bottle from the back seat.

01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:02.667
The bottle!

01:27:08.543 --> 01:27:10.232
Throw it in the pond.

01:27:10.849 --> 01:27:15.239
- You mean... in the water?
- Yes!

01:27:44.865 --> 01:27:49.116
Hurry up, we're leaving!

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.367
I'll be crushed.
I'd rather wait in the dust.

01:27:57.498 --> 01:28:00.372
(indistinct)

01:28:00.397 --> 01:28:01.953
Here he comes.

01:28:13.415 --> 01:28:16.745
What happened?
It's already late.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:21.008
(indistinct chatter)

01:28:21.032 --> 01:28:23.151
We almost gave up today.

01:28:23.175 --> 01:28:27.145
(indistinct chatter)

01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:30.553
A cup of tea, quickly.

01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:35.004
- You still here?
- I was waiting for you.

01:28:38.028 --> 01:28:40.807
It will be fine, don't worry.

01:28:44.507 --> 01:28:46.867
I'm away with the boss
for a few days.

01:28:49.971 --> 01:28:52.210
I'm worried about Neeli.

01:28:53.764 --> 01:28:55.938
You can see the sort they are.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.953
They dare not hassle me,
but they may take it out on Neeli...

01:29:01.978 --> 01:29:06.317
As long as I'm here, have no worries.

01:29:06.359 --> 01:29:09.103
No bastard will dare bother her.

01:29:14.249 --> 01:29:16.758
Panchmati...

01:29:18.795 --> 01:29:20.514
Come on, let's go!

01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:27.052
What happened today?
Why are you late?

01:29:28.977 --> 01:29:33.228
- Is the black eye from an accident?
- No.

01:29:33.855 --> 01:29:36.509
- What, then?
- A mosquito.

01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:40.615
- A mosquito bit me.
- Strange!

01:29:43.342 --> 01:29:46.051
Singhji's sense of humour is intact.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.047
How fast can your car go?

01:29:56.715 --> 01:29:59.639
What's it matter? We're doing well.

01:29:59.664 --> 01:30:04.485
This is the age of speed.
Mitter, don't be nervous.

01:30:04.588 --> 01:30:08.245
It's Nripen I'm nervous about...

01:30:08.312 --> 01:30:12.474
His horoscope predicts
death by accident.

01:30:15.403 --> 01:30:16.603
Oh! I see.

01:31:32.906 --> 01:31:34.980
Everyone, hold tight!

01:31:43.078 --> 01:31:45.798
<i>I know now it is love,
whether you admit it or not.</i>

01:31:46.447 --> 01:31:50.493
<i>My love, I am indebted to you.</i>

01:32:02.282 --> 01:32:06.387
<i>Walk carefully on the road...</i>

01:32:06.706 --> 01:32:10.906
I'm off in the car, got work to do.
You walk back home.

01:35:21.991 --> 01:35:23.953
Will you take us to the ferry?

01:35:27.407 --> 01:35:28.948
What's the matter?

01:35:29.255 --> 01:35:30.555
We're going away.

01:35:32.859 --> 01:35:35.949
We're running away to Kolkata.

01:35:36.914 --> 01:35:39.710
Running away? Why?

01:35:42.439 --> 01:35:44.151
We're getting married.

01:35:50.193 --> 01:35:52.061
It's impossible here.

01:35:53.713 --> 01:35:59.343
You heard my mother.
We won't have a chance here.

01:36:00.196 --> 01:36:02.948
Don't turn us away.

01:36:05.479 --> 01:36:07.310
We have no one else.

01:36:08.871 --> 01:36:11.085
You are my only friend.

01:36:12.547 --> 01:36:14.935
It's been so long for both of us...

01:36:21.588 --> 01:36:24.152
You've done so much for me.

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:31.166
A last request,
please take us to the ferry.

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:40.900
Singhji...

01:36:54.579 --> 01:36:55.849
Come on, then.

01:37:04.811 --> 01:37:07.621
Come on, hurry!

01:37:10.033 --> 01:37:11.098
Come on.

01:37:59.249 --> 01:38:01.442
- Rama!
- Singhji?

01:38:04.342 --> 01:38:05.411
That girl...

01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:07.985
Gulabi?

01:38:10.646 --> 01:38:12.277
Send her to my room.

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:50.117
You have been lied.

01:40:43.773 --> 01:40:46.150
Rama, get me some tea.

01:41:28.559 --> 01:41:32.786
- Didn't you see me?
- When?

01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:38.380
A minute ago.
I was standing by the well.

01:41:56.796 --> 01:41:59.043
- Is something worrying you?
- Huh?

01:41:59.966 --> 01:42:01.878
Are you thinking?

01:42:04.298 --> 01:42:05.782
Lots to think about.

01:42:06.852 --> 01:42:08.414
I know that.

01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:20.951
- Take this.
- What?

01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:22.997
Sweets.

01:42:25.096 --> 01:42:26.229
Misti.
(sweets in Bengali)

01:42:28.444 --> 01:42:29.973
I made them.

01:42:32.322 --> 01:42:36.981
I made some for you the other day
and left them on the roof terrace.

01:42:37.671 --> 01:42:40.489
The monkeys ran off with them.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.687
<i>Gulabi...</i>

01:42:49.158 --> 01:42:54.598
Aren't you afraid to come here
in broad daylight?

01:42:54.822 --> 01:42:56.116
Why?

01:42:57.219 --> 01:42:59.529
Your master will beat you up.

01:43:00.227 --> 01:43:04.068
Master? You are my master.

01:43:04.266 --> 01:43:05.278
Nonsense!

01:43:12.544 --> 01:43:13.570
You like it?

01:43:14.527 --> 01:43:16.256
Everything's good when you're hungry.

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:21.343
I didn't eat last night,
my stomach was rumbling.

01:43:23.099 --> 01:43:28.106
I know how to cook, very well.
Grandma taught me.

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:34.464
I can cook, sewing...

01:43:34.781 --> 01:43:37.648
husk rice, fetch water.

01:43:38.850 --> 01:43:41.504
- I can sing, too.
- Really?

01:43:47.062 --> 01:43:53.459
<i>The orchards are in full bloom.</i>

01:43:54.235 --> 01:43:58.386
<i>My beloved does not come.</i>

01:43:59.441 --> 01:44:05.682
<i>The mango groves are green and ripe.</i>

01:44:07.834 --> 01:44:14.187
<i>The Mahua blossoms beckon you.</i>

01:44:15.197 --> 01:44:21.658
<i>The Mahua blossoms beckon you.</i>

01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:29.475
<i>The woods are alive with love.</i>

01:44:38.273 --> 01:44:43.151
<i>The woods are alive with love.</i>

01:44:43.756 --> 01:44:48.741
<i>The woods are alive with love.</i>

01:44:49.369 --> 01:44:54.097
<i>The woods are alive with love.</i>

01:44:55.511 --> 01:44:58.715
<i>My beloved does not come.</i>

01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:03.931
Wonderful!

01:45:04.915 --> 01:45:07.055
Did Grandma teach you
that as well?

01:45:07.666 --> 01:45:09.555
I had no one else.

01:45:10.778 --> 01:45:13.063
- What about your mother?
- No...

01:45:14.085 --> 01:45:20.150
She died when I was born.
That's how all my troubles started.

01:45:21.004 --> 01:45:26.829
So when this man forced himself
on me, they said...

01:45:27.218 --> 01:45:31.278
"When you were born
your mother died.

01:45:32.984 --> 01:45:37.331
"Now you are no use for anything else".

01:45:38.013 --> 01:45:39.373
What did you say?

01:45:42.208 --> 01:45:45.081
There was a pond behind the house.

01:45:45.905 --> 01:45:48.844
- Understood what I said?
- Yes, you mean pond.

01:45:50.472 --> 01:45:55.398
I wanted to tie a rock around my neck
and drown in that pond.

01:45:55.423 --> 01:45:56.981
Why didn't you do it?

01:45:57.690 --> 01:46:00.562
Because they locked me up.

01:46:01.059 --> 01:46:04.856
Lord, how they hit me...

01:46:04.961 --> 01:46:08.477
slapped me, kicked me.

01:46:08.581 --> 01:46:11.267
They pulled my hair, dragged me...

01:46:11.368 --> 01:46:13.989
and locked me in a room.

01:46:15.116 --> 01:46:20.041
Seven days I lay there without food.

01:46:20.144 --> 01:46:24.786
Nothing to eat, nothing to drink,
not even a drop.

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:31.286
For seven days and nights
all I did...

01:46:32.253 --> 01:46:35.736
was sit and think how to die.

01:46:38.545 --> 01:46:41.417
Then one day...

01:46:46.509 --> 01:46:50.386
I noticed a box in the corner
of the room.

01:46:53.504 --> 01:46:58.692
I dragged it to the middle
and stood on it.

01:47:00.644 --> 01:47:05.635
I took off my sari and tied
one end around my neck...

01:47:06.922 --> 01:47:08.617
and the other end to the ceiling beam.

01:47:09.609 --> 01:47:11.249
And then what happened?

01:47:12.688 --> 01:47:15.560
- It all went wrong.
- Why?

01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:25.813
Do you think it's easy
to take your own life?

01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:31.034
To leave everything
and disappear forever?

01:47:32.324 --> 01:47:36.521
The festival of Dusshera
was coming in a month.

01:47:36.968 --> 01:47:41.927
I'd wear my new clothes,
drums would beat.

01:47:42.413 --> 01:47:44.325
There would be a fair...

01:47:44.894 --> 01:47:50.235
stalls, lights, a big wheel
and a show.

01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:57.857
In November,
Spuliya would be getting married.

01:47:58.115 --> 01:48:00.333
There would be wedding music.

01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:03.150
The groom would arrive on his horse.

01:48:05.075 --> 01:48:07.925
To leave all this and go...

01:48:09.143 --> 01:48:11.349
and see nothing?

01:48:12.538 --> 01:48:14.907
And I'm not even...

01:48:15.421 --> 01:48:16.473
What?

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:22.454
My groom would come one day,
my prince...

01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:26.300
like in grandma's stories.

01:48:29.606 --> 01:48:32.194
And I could not die.

01:48:52.441 --> 01:48:53.466
Tea.

01:49:16.847 --> 01:49:18.605
Are you going out?

01:49:19.147 --> 01:49:22.566
Yes, to the lawyer's.

01:49:24.822 --> 01:49:27.607
It's difficult in the daytime.

01:49:27.632 --> 01:49:31.537
If I were your wife,
wouldn't you look at me in the day?

01:49:33.252 --> 01:49:34.369
My wife?

01:49:35.649 --> 01:49:38.807
If you love me,
why don't we marry?

01:49:41.382 --> 01:49:43.597
What will happen to the company
if we get married?

01:49:45.072 --> 01:49:47.016
We'd have to run away.

01:49:47.859 --> 01:49:52.202
Is this place any good?
Are these people good?

01:49:58.205 --> 01:50:03.159
I have a chance, why let it go?

01:50:05.989 --> 01:50:10.922
Am I to be a taxi driver all my life?

01:50:13.357 --> 01:50:16.229
There's no respect in it.

01:50:19.475 --> 01:50:22.609
Everyone is rude to you...

01:50:22.710 --> 01:50:26.391
swear at you, get angry.

01:50:28.316 --> 01:50:31.188
Haggle over the fare.

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:41.333
Look at the room I'm given to sleep in.
One side is full of sacks.

01:50:45.085 --> 01:50:47.958
This will change
when I have a company.

01:50:49.730 --> 01:50:52.602
I'll never get another opportunity
like this, Gulabi.

01:50:55.437 --> 01:50:56.902
All right, then.

01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:05.262
Gulabi?

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:10.932
You will come tonight, won't you?

01:51:19.628 --> 01:51:21.367
Greetings!

01:51:21.502 --> 01:51:23.259
Please sit down.

01:51:23.451 --> 01:51:26.716
Singhji is outside.
Shall I ask him in?

01:51:26.752 --> 01:51:29.047
Yes, of course.

01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:33.700
- Just a minute.
- Sir?

01:51:35.301 --> 01:51:36.718
Just a minute...

01:51:39.083 --> 01:51:43.344
Before he comes in,
have you arranged for...

01:51:43.506 --> 01:51:47.667
You've known me for 14 years.

01:51:47.692 --> 01:51:50.728
Have I ever let you down?

01:51:52.054 --> 01:51:54.631
I'll be away for a few days.

01:51:54.656 --> 01:51:58.559
But you are here tonight, aren't you?

01:51:58.584 --> 01:52:01.784
Don't worry,
I have something special for you.

01:52:10.428 --> 01:52:11.454
This is Singh.

01:52:21.142 --> 01:52:26.232
- I've heard a lot about you. Sit down.
- I'm fine here.

01:52:27.132 --> 01:52:30.452
Fine? There is a chair, please sit down.

01:52:31.344 --> 01:52:36.084
How can we talk if you keep standing?

01:52:36.718 --> 01:52:37.906
Sit down.

01:52:45.916 --> 01:52:51.836
Singhji's family has lived in Bengal
for five generations.

01:52:51.877 --> 01:52:53.806
I see!

01:52:54.311 --> 01:53:00.336
In my grandfather's time a coachman
would not dare sit with us.

01:53:00.361 --> 01:53:03.159
Today we are all equals.

01:53:07.015 --> 01:53:12.048
- The thing is, Mr. Mansingh...
- Narsingh!

01:53:12.814 --> 01:53:15.930
Narsingh? means Narasingha...
That's very good.

01:53:16.946 --> 01:53:21.834
Mr. Narsingh, I don't know you.

01:53:23.448 --> 01:53:27.609
He is a friend, a trusted friend.

01:53:27.996 --> 01:53:32.507
Because of him,
I agreed to talk to you.

01:53:33.795 --> 01:53:38.502
You know all about cars...

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.707
you even have experience.

01:53:41.385 --> 01:53:47.021
You are also wise and clever.
That is your capital.

01:53:47.908 --> 01:53:49.908
- No hard cash...
- Cash?

01:53:52.854 --> 01:53:55.190
You are not investing any money.

01:53:55.516 --> 01:53:58.246
- What about my car?
- Car?

01:53:58.579 --> 01:54:00.272
I'm putting my car into the deal.

01:54:00.373 --> 01:54:03.311
- What car?
- I have only one car, a Chrysler.

01:54:03.914 --> 01:54:06.814
The one outside with the canvas top?
That honks away?

01:54:07.305 --> 01:54:08.638
That... crap?

01:54:09.703 --> 01:54:13.013
You mean my car is no good?
Ask him.

01:54:13.038 --> 01:54:17.260
He doesn't mean it's bad or anything,

01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:21.225
he means that if you have
a new company...

01:54:21.250 --> 01:54:27.564
you can't go about in a taxi
that's 25 years old.

01:54:27.925 --> 01:54:28.951
Exactly.

01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:35.297
You belong to the rising generation.
If you cling to old things...

01:54:35.398 --> 01:54:39.277
- What shall I do with it?
- Sell it.

01:54:39.834 --> 01:54:41.036
Sell it.

01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:44.874
If you get 700 rupees,
put it into the company.

01:54:45.313 --> 01:54:49.278
But your share will be one-third.

01:54:49.352 --> 01:54:55.138
Full partnership is no small
consideration. Well, Singhji?

01:55:05.339 --> 01:55:08.211
Don't you like the offer?

01:55:09.567 --> 01:55:14.558
It's a good car, it's served me well.

01:55:16.005 --> 01:55:18.725
The engine's smooth.

01:55:20.028 --> 01:55:21.138
Singhji...

01:55:26.384 --> 01:55:30.199
Look at this brand new set of teeth.

01:55:30.742 --> 01:55:34.422
I once owned the 1910 model.

01:55:34.966 --> 01:55:39.718
They were no good anymore,
I had them pulled out.

01:55:43.927 --> 01:55:49.017
Now I can eat the toughest meat.

01:55:55.754 --> 01:55:56.760
All right.

01:56:05.306 --> 01:56:06.322
Singhji...

01:56:10.992 --> 01:56:15.292
I see a smile on your face at last.

01:56:17.283 --> 01:56:18.495
Rama?

01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:22.010
Singhji...

01:56:24.595 --> 01:56:28.336
I can get at least 1,000 rupees
for this car.

01:56:28.361 --> 01:56:32.063
That's guaranteed.
Don't worry about the price.

01:56:40.835 --> 01:56:45.274
There's only one thing left now.

01:56:47.075 --> 01:56:48.106
What?

01:56:49.810 --> 01:56:51.183
The ghee tin.

01:56:56.359 --> 01:56:58.157
Start the car.

01:57:09.511 --> 01:57:14.626
Here's the address, drive straight in.
Give it to Mr. Jaggu.

01:57:15.191 --> 01:57:16.306
Okay.

01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:23.951
Singhji...

01:57:29.612 --> 01:57:32.430
Do you want to take this?

01:57:45.639 --> 01:57:46.713
Singhji?

01:57:51.006 --> 01:57:52.715
Will you sell the car?

01:57:53.809 --> 01:57:58.101
Yes. Anything to say about that?

01:57:59.342 --> 01:58:00.627
Give it to me.

01:58:00.735 --> 01:58:04.388
- Why should I give it to you?
- I will drive it.

01:58:05.367 --> 01:58:07.731
Can you pay me 1,000 rupees for it?

01:58:09.836 --> 01:58:14.616
Not now, but in two years,
when I run a taxi service.

01:58:15.442 --> 01:58:19.558
What service? Won't you stay with me,
in my company?

01:58:21.357 --> 01:58:26.259
How can I stay without a car?
I can't do it.

01:58:28.492 --> 01:58:32.301
Bastard! Don't let me see
your face again!

01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:13.543
- I know.
- So why are you here?

01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:20.033
You will take that and deliver it.

01:59:21.355 --> 01:59:22.718
I know.

01:59:24.486 --> 01:59:28.048
Sukhanram's friends, such gentlemen.

01:59:31.098 --> 01:59:32.787
What is it to you?

01:59:36.575 --> 01:59:40.935
I know what's inside. Opium.

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.870
Isn't that a sin?

01:59:45.526 --> 01:59:48.593
My wife ran away. Wasn't that a sin?

01:59:52.304 --> 01:59:54.248
You come to my room at night.

01:59:56.165 --> 01:59:57.541
Isn't that a sin?

02:00:00.298 --> 02:00:06.250
Yes, it is. For a girl like me,
to love is a sin.

02:00:13.878 --> 02:00:19.586
I'll be back in an hour. Come then.

02:00:21.362 --> 02:00:22.508
Why?

02:00:24.703 --> 02:00:26.427
Why should I come?

02:00:28.323 --> 02:00:32.451
I'm asking you to come.
Won't you come?

02:00:34.388 --> 02:00:37.670
Are you my boss, to be obeyed?

02:00:38.988 --> 02:00:39.989
Gulabi?

02:00:40.835 --> 02:00:46.787
Don't you know who my boss is?
He's your boss, too.

02:00:48.502 --> 02:00:50.744
Salaam, Rana Pratap Singh.

02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:53.376
Gulabi...

02:01:51.334 --> 02:01:54.806
- Listen, I have important news.
- What is that?

02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.329
Sukhanram's house
is going to be raided.

02:01:57.596 --> 02:01:59.847
I overheard the boss.

02:02:00.125 --> 02:02:04.155
I thought I'd warn you to watch out.

02:02:04.258 --> 02:02:08.670
I'll be back in an hour, see you then.

02:02:08.774 --> 02:02:12.762
- Where are you off to?
- Work, a few repairs.

02:02:12.787 --> 02:02:14.906
All right, I'm going home.

02:02:44.545 --> 02:02:46.572
I'll help you start up.

02:03:23.079 --> 02:03:24.262
Joseph...

02:03:33.710 --> 02:03:35.825
Where are you going?

02:04:15.202 --> 02:04:19.026
Well done. Warrior.

02:04:29.245 --> 02:04:30.291
Joseph...

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:57.337
Joseph...

02:05:00.370 --> 02:05:05.361
I'll be back, Joseph.

02:05:46.327 --> 02:05:47.597
Mr Sukhanram.

02:05:53.579 --> 02:05:54.728
Mr Sukhanram?

02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:08.234
- He's gone out.
- Where?

02:06:08.623 --> 02:06:10.098
To the lawyer's.

02:06:20.358 --> 02:06:21.823
Has the boss gone out?

02:06:22.113 --> 02:06:23.295
Yes, Singhji.

02:06:23.422 --> 02:06:24.765
Was anyone with him?

02:06:25.781 --> 02:06:27.105
That girl.
(Gulabi)

02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:38.731
- Come on.
- Where to?

02:06:38.756 --> 02:06:40.962
We've work to do.

02:07:12.476 --> 02:07:16.358
Gulabi, come with me.

02:07:21.067 --> 02:07:23.655
The game's up. Taxi service is over.

02:07:33.063 --> 02:07:37.436
- Where are we going?
- Home, Gulabi.

02:07:42.159 --> 02:07:46.349
Thieves! Stop them!

02:08:01.753 --> 02:08:02.998
I'm going, Joseph.

02:08:08.816 --> 02:08:11.175
I'm off to Giribraja!
See you there.

02:08:38.601 --> 02:08:40.518
THE END
