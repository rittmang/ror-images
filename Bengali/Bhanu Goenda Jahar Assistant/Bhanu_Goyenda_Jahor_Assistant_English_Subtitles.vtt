00:00:21.959--> 00:00:22.959
After almost an hour.

00:00:23.635--> 00:00:25.267
Did any case come?
- What?

00:00:27.802--> 00:00:28.923
Was there any case?

00:00:29.008--> 00:00:30.515
Yes, spicy chicken.

00:00:30.605--> 00:00:31.753
Shut up. Spicy chicken.

00:00:31.942--> 00:00:33.382
We are asking if there was any case?

00:00:33.457--> 00:00:34.994
What?
- Case?

00:00:35.306--> 00:00:38.495
Yes. I have seated
them in the room inside.

00:00:38.587--> 00:00:40.372
In the room inside.

00:01:17.616--> 00:01:18.662
Whom do you want?

00:01:19.086--> 00:01:21.872
Detective.
- I'm him. Please be seated.

00:01:22.521--> 00:01:25.621
I'm his assistant.
- Please, sit.

00:01:27.425--> 00:01:28.641
What is the case?

00:01:29.695--> 00:01:31.878
My Kamala..
- Has gone missing?

00:01:32.726--> 00:01:33.726
Since when?

00:01:34.101--> 00:01:37.751
Yesterday evening, when she left..
- She didn't come back.

00:01:37.836--> 00:01:41.521
Yes. Please find my Kamala,
dear son.

00:01:46.445--> 00:01:47.491
What did you understand?

00:01:47.957--> 00:01:50.429
Last evening, Kamala left home..

00:01:51.382--> 00:01:52.565
And hasn't returned since.

00:01:53.206--> 00:01:55.467
It is a case of disappearance.
- Correct.

00:01:59.908--> 00:02:02.404
I think we can take up the case.
- Sure, exactly.

00:02:03.152--> 00:02:05.444
What will happen?
Will I see her again?

00:02:05.824--> 00:02:10.137
Do you have a photograph of Kamala?

00:02:10.894--> 00:02:12.247
I have no photograph.

00:02:13.263--> 00:02:16.846
Please tell me what
Kamala looks like?

00:02:17.422--> 00:02:21.114
She is very fair.
She has big black eyes.

00:02:21.513--> 00:02:24.960
Fair complexion and big black eyes.

00:02:25.301--> 00:02:28.062
It seems that she is beautiful.
- You must be enjoying writing.

00:02:29.547--> 00:02:30.931
Tell me something else.

00:02:32.271--> 00:02:35.170
She is very calm. Very obedient.

00:02:35.497--> 00:02:36.699
That isn't all that important.

00:02:37.521--> 00:02:39.041
Please tell me something else.

00:02:39.813--> 00:02:41.778
I'll tell you, son. I'll tell you.

00:02:42.446--> 00:02:45.028
Everyday she gives 250ml milk.

00:02:45.245--> 00:02:47.531
Milk.. milk?

00:02:48.635--> 00:02:51.710
She gives milk?
- Kamala gives milk?

00:02:53.340--> 00:02:54.444
She must be a mother.

00:02:54.974--> 00:02:58.323
No, she is a cow.

00:02:58.728--> 00:03:03.349
It has been a year since
I bought her for Rs.5.

00:03:03.441--> 00:03:06.455
Hopeless. We don't deal with cows.

00:03:06.547--> 00:03:09.565
Where shall I find her then?
- Go to the police.

00:03:10.005--> 00:03:11.524
I didn't find her there.

00:03:11.616--> 00:03:13.358
Then go to Vrindavan.
- Vrindavan?

00:03:13.450--> 00:03:15.702
Yes, to the stable of cows.
- Yes, go there.

00:03:18.003--> 00:03:19.686
At the end a cow's case?

00:03:20.320--> 00:03:22.039
Bhanu, how many
times I have told you..

00:03:22.197--> 00:03:24.301
To join the police
detective department.

00:03:24.633--> 00:03:26.605
There, we will have an
income and respect as well.

00:03:26.882--> 00:03:28.082
My foot, we will get anything.

00:03:28.437--> 00:03:29.783
What will be the value
of my talent over there?

00:03:29.807--> 00:03:31.055
How much will they pay me?

00:03:31.960--> 00:03:37.134
Remember, this land of Bengal,
why just Bengal..

00:03:37.226--> 00:03:40.385
This whole country
will know detective Bhanu.

00:03:42.304--> 00:03:44.662
You are right.
Don't lose heart, Bhanu.

00:03:45.542--> 00:03:47.263
If we get a good case,
you will be as..

00:03:47.492--> 00:03:49.394
Famous as Robert Blake.

00:03:50.717--> 00:03:51.576
Here, Ghantaghana.

00:03:51.668--> 00:03:53.708
Did they give the newspaper today?
- Why a mattress?

00:03:54.404--> 00:03:55.876
Not a mattress. Newspaper.

00:03:56.050--> 00:03:59.674
Newspaper?
Three months' subscription is due.

00:03:59.759--> 00:04:00.798
He said that he won't give anymore.

00:04:00.822--> 00:04:02.383
Oh, they won't? Listen. Listen.

00:04:05.372--> 00:04:06.873
Get the paper from
the neighbour's house?

00:04:06.897--> 00:04:09.759
Aunt's house?
- Neighbour's house.

00:04:10.643--> 00:04:11.992
You could have told this earlier.

00:04:18.118--> 00:04:20.370
Why have you kept this deaf man?

00:04:21.478--> 00:04:24.702
Detectives have a lot of secrets, right?
- Yes.

00:04:24.794--> 00:04:26.073
He can't hear anything.

00:04:28.120--> 00:04:32.711
That is why when he asks for
his salary, we can't hear.

00:04:34.182--> 00:04:35.883
You're very intelligent, Bhanu.

00:04:36.270--> 00:04:37.350
Now, let me work.

00:07:44.869--> 00:07:46.967
Nupur, when did you
come back from Delhi?

00:07:47.145--> 00:07:48.970
Just now. I came to you, Sheila.

00:07:49.062--> 00:07:50.710
Really? Come inside.

00:07:52.507--> 00:07:55.243
No letter or news. All of a
sudden you came to Kolkata?

00:07:55.335--> 00:07:59.976
Kolkata? I came for a job interview.

00:08:00.068--> 00:08:02.379
Interview? Does your father agree?

00:08:02.471--> 00:08:05.534
Father? No. Yes, he agreed.

00:08:05.626--> 00:08:10.167
Sheila. Sheila, I'm leaving.

00:08:10.511--> 00:08:12.200
Let me introduce. Nupur Chatterjee.

00:08:12.285--> 00:08:13.596
We would study in the
same college in Delhi.

00:08:13.620--> 00:08:14.666
Hello.
- Hello.

00:08:35.478--> 00:08:36.505
Bhanu, read this.

00:08:36.631--> 00:08:38.347
What is it?
- Case.

00:08:39.465--> 00:08:42.848
Again a case?
- Yes. Look at this.

00:08:45.704--> 00:08:46.750
Read this. Read this.

00:08:48.291--> 00:08:50.640
My daughter, Nupur Chatterjee..

00:08:50.816--> 00:08:52.492
Has disappeared from Delhi.

00:08:52.780--> 00:08:59.649
Age, 23-24. Colour, very fair.

00:08:59.741--> 00:09:01.470
Height, 5 feet 3 inches.

00:09:01.721--> 00:09:03.473
Mole on the right cheek.

00:09:04.308--> 00:09:08.872
Person who finds her
will get 10,000.. Rs.10,000.

00:09:09.289--> 00:09:12.749
Dr. Digambar Chatterjee,
Daryaganj, Delhi.

00:09:12.948--> 00:09:15.921
Rs.10,000.
- Did you see Nupur Chatterjee's face?

00:09:54.970--> 00:09:56.789
I see you have a
habit of waking up early.

00:09:58.450--> 00:10:01.102
Will you have tea or cola?
- Whatever you give.

00:10:01.270--> 00:10:03.128
Go wash your hands.
I will prepare breakfast.

00:10:05.680--> 00:10:07.828
Didn't they give the paper today?

00:10:07.999--> 00:10:09.117
Paper?

00:10:10.818--> 00:10:14.533
No.
- Isn't it on the veranda?

00:10:16.381--> 00:10:17.427
No.

00:10:18.368--> 00:10:20.298
Our newspaper
vendor is getting worse.

00:10:21.041--> 00:10:23.930
I will send the guard.
- Don't send the guard.

00:10:24.742--> 00:10:27.343
The vendor said the
papers are closed today.

00:10:27.535--> 00:10:33.114
Closed? Why?
- There has been a strike at the office.

00:10:33.357--> 00:10:35.075
I see.

00:10:50.231--> 00:10:54.336
"Today, my inebriation has
brought me out of the shadows."

00:10:54.428--> 00:10:56.100
Good evening, Ms. Chatterjee.

00:11:03.350--> 00:11:05.328
Yes. I see you are in the house.

00:11:07.104--> 00:11:08.351
Why are you switching it off?

00:11:10.341--> 00:11:13.431
No, I'm not switching it off.

00:11:20.618--> 00:11:22.761
Which station are you
searching for? Delhi?

00:11:22.853--> 00:11:26.333
Delhi?
No, I can't remember properly.

00:11:26.424--> 00:11:28.471
Where is Sheila?
She didn't give you the tea.

00:11:28.559--> 00:11:30.367
Sheila. Sheila.

00:11:36.321--> 00:11:37.367
When did you come?

00:11:42.894--> 00:11:44.734
What are you reading
with so much of attention?

00:11:44.963--> 00:11:47.818
Read this area marked
with the red pencil.

00:11:50.731--> 00:11:53.315
Newspaper? Today's?
- Yes.

00:11:58.695--> 00:12:01.959
My daughter, Nupur Chatterjee..

00:12:03.340--> 00:12:05.927
Has disappeared from Delhi.

00:12:16.372--> 00:12:18.745
That is why Nupur was
saying in the morning..

00:12:18.830--> 00:12:20.606
The newspapers
haven't come out today.

00:12:20.791--> 00:12:21.945
Strike.

00:12:22.770--> 00:12:23.788
Was she really saying?

00:12:23.880--> 00:12:26.928
She fought with her
father and ran away from home.

00:12:27.399--> 00:12:28.459
Must be.

00:12:28.627--> 00:12:31.148
When she does not have any husband..

00:12:31.454--> 00:12:33.609
Who else will she fight
against except her old father.

00:12:33.633--> 00:12:36.833
Listen, let us send a telegram
to Nupur's father tomorrow.

00:12:37.165--> 00:12:39.506
We just can't let go
Rs.10,000 like that.

00:12:39.967--> 00:12:42.705
Sure, sure. What is
the need for a telegram?

00:12:43.098--> 00:12:44.877
I'm flying to
Delhi tomorrow morning.

00:12:45.221--> 00:12:48.103
I can go to Dr. Chatterjee
and bring him here.

00:12:48.271--> 00:12:49.336
What say?

00:12:55.331--> 00:12:58.117
Do keep an eye on your friend?
- Definitely.

00:13:12.963--> 00:13:15.433
Are you leaving? Where? Why?

00:13:15.774--> 00:13:18.821
I was just going to market to shop.

00:13:18.913--> 00:13:21.461
Shopping? It is only 7 o'clock now.
All shops are closed.

00:13:21.553--> 00:13:22.611
Go in the evening.

00:13:22.787--> 00:13:26.099
Evening?
I won't get time in the evening.

00:13:26.921--> 00:13:30.420
I have to go for the job interview.

00:13:30.985--> 00:13:32.185
Then I too will come with you.

00:13:32.343--> 00:13:35.471
You? Why should you come?

00:13:36.060--> 00:13:38.902
If you go alone, you will get tired.
Wait, I will get my bag.

00:13:38.994--> 00:13:43.049
Listen, it would have
been good if you had come.

00:13:43.257--> 00:13:48.924
But there is a trivial issue.
- Issue? What issue?

00:13:49.770--> 00:13:53.631
The issue is that
someone is supposed..

00:13:54.319--> 00:13:55.929
To come here in the morning.

00:13:56.558--> 00:14:02.000
Who?
- I mean a friend of mine.

00:14:03.071--> 00:14:06.944
Friend? - Yes, we were
introduced in Delhi last year.

00:14:07.361--> 00:14:08.975
He has also come to town.

00:14:09.293--> 00:14:13.308
So, you are having secret meetings.
What is the name?

00:14:13.397--> 00:14:15.825
Name? The name is Dilip Kumar.

00:14:15.917--> 00:14:18.636
Dilip Kumar? What does he look like?

00:14:18.728--> 00:14:23.319
Looks? Sheila I'm getting late.
Receive him from my side.

00:14:23.411--> 00:14:25.011
Just tell him I will
be back immediately.

00:14:42.535--> 00:14:45.583
"What happens when,
who will be able to tell.."

00:14:45.672--> 00:14:49.118
"how many lovely
stories are formed along.."

00:14:49.332--> 00:14:53.860
"the road of our lives,
who can say?"

00:14:54.486--> 00:14:57.291
"What happens when,
who will be able to tell.."

00:14:57.383--> 00:15:00.900
"how many lovely
stories are formed along.."

00:15:01.258--> 00:15:05.878
"the road of our lives,
who can say?"

00:15:22.670--> 00:15:26.157
"So many beggars get
lakhs of rupees.."

00:15:26.249--> 00:15:29.225
"so many kings become paupers."

00:15:29.416--> 00:15:36.141
"Who knows whose destiny
might change in this world?"

00:15:37.991--> 00:15:41.642
"How many lovely
stories are formed along.."

00:15:41.821--> 00:15:46.651
"the road of our lives,
who can say?"

00:15:46.967--> 00:15:49.849
"What happens when,
who will be able to tell.."

00:15:49.936--> 00:15:53.690
"how many lovely
stories are formed along.."

00:15:53.782--> 00:15:58.198
"the road of our lives,
who can say?"

00:16:12.298--> 00:16:20.298
"Believe me or not,
life is more interesting than a novel."

00:16:25.851--> 00:16:33.851
"Believe me or not,
life is more interesting than a novel."

00:16:39.249--> 00:16:42.618
"A magician might
make gold disappear.."

00:16:42.710--> 00:16:45.905
"and beauty lies in
the eyes of the beholder."

00:16:52.799--> 00:16:56.110
"A magician might
make gold disappear.."

00:16:56.202--> 00:16:59.034
"and beauty lies in
the eyes of the beholder."

00:16:59.126--> 00:17:02.650
"Maybe you will give
your heart to a person..

00:17:02.742--> 00:17:05.995
"Who you have never dreamt of."

00:17:06.087--> 00:17:09.791
How many lovely
stories are formed along.."

00:17:09.883--> 00:17:14.805
"the road of our lives,
who can say?"

00:17:15.088--> 00:17:17.940
"What happens when,
who will be able to tell.."

00:17:18.032--> 00:17:21.788
"how many lovely
stories are formed along.."

00:17:21.880--> 00:17:26.783
"the road of our lives,
who can say?"

00:17:29.856--> 00:17:32.039
Boy. Skewered Kebab.

00:19:07.058--> 00:19:08.104
Boy.

00:19:10.028--> 00:19:11.619
Bhanu. The girl.

00:19:11.704--> 00:19:13.381
The girl?
- Yes. - The girl.

00:19:23.997--> 00:19:27.748
Where? - Bhanu, she was right here.
Where did she go?

00:19:28.711--> 00:19:30.872
If she was here, where did she go?
- What do you mean?

00:19:31.285--> 00:19:33.264
Did you check properly?
- Sure and certain.

00:19:33.684--> 00:19:35.124
Was there a mole on the right cheek?

00:19:36.668--> 00:19:39.179
Probably.
- Very fair complexion? - Probably.

00:19:39.436--> 00:19:41.824
What probably?
What were you looking at?

00:19:43.373--> 00:19:44.635
Beauty.
- Rubbish.

00:19:45.041--> 00:19:47.241
When you had come to call me
couldn't you keep her busy?

00:19:47.310--> 00:19:48.420
How could I have kept her busy?

00:19:48.444--> 00:19:50.491
You could have
introduced yourself to her.

00:19:50.906--> 00:19:52.466
That was what I had
thought of, Brother.

00:19:54.171--> 00:19:58.970
But when I saw her,
the 'Calm September' music..

00:19:59.055--> 00:20:01.136
Started playing in my heart.

00:20:01.691--> 00:20:05.435
'Calm September' started
playing in your heart? Shut up.

00:20:05.685--> 00:20:06.240
You should quit being a detective.

00:20:06.329--> 00:20:07.439
You will not be able
to do this work.

00:20:07.463--> 00:20:08.321
Why are you getting angry?

00:20:08.413--> 00:20:10.333
Hey, where is the
madam who was sitting here?

00:20:10.425--> 00:20:12.045
She just went down.
- Come with me.

00:21:16.954--> 00:21:18.371
Okay, Anjan, that is our plan then.

00:21:18.554--> 00:21:20.132
So, you are coming
to Burdhman on Sunday?

00:21:20.156--> 00:21:21.876
Yes, but is your money
and everything ready?

00:21:21.921--> 00:21:23.481
Yes, you don't have
to worry about that.

00:21:23.536--> 00:21:25.971
Do one thing.
Make someone wait at the station.

00:21:26.063--> 00:21:28.223
I will be there myself.
Okay, I'll take your leave now.

00:21:30.800--> 00:21:33.199
You have a wonderful voice.
- I feel like dying for the voice.

00:21:33.223--> 00:21:35.551
Thank you.
- Please give us one autograph.

00:21:35.637--> 00:21:38.055
Please, autograph.
- Autograph?

00:21:38.140--> 00:21:39.561
Please give us one autograph.

00:21:40.431--> 00:21:44.331
What happened?
- Pain in the stomach.

00:21:44.423--> 00:21:46.294
Please, some other time.

00:22:50.729--> 00:22:53.811
No. Please don't be scared.
I'm no ghost.

00:22:54.708--> 00:22:58.218
Then how did you get
onto a moving car? Yes?

00:22:58.537--> 00:22:59.857
I didn't get onto the moving car.

00:22:59.995--> 00:23:01.896
I mean, I came into
your car earlier and was..

00:23:01.988--> 00:23:03.662
Hiding under the back seat.

00:23:03.995--> 00:23:06.289
You were hiding?
- Yes. - Why?

00:23:06.546--> 00:23:12.335
Just for one night. - For night,
in my car? Is my car a hotel?

00:23:13.685--> 00:23:15.485
Do you think I don't
understand what you want?

00:23:15.595--> 00:23:18.371
Get down. Get down.
I don't like such girls.

00:23:18.456--> 00:23:22.403
Please listen. Please don't
get annoyed. I'm a lonely girl.

00:23:22.527--> 00:23:24.312
Where will I go so late at night?

00:23:25.326--> 00:23:30.252
Please help me for one night.
I'm in a grave problem.

00:23:31.903--> 00:23:35.657
Then I'm in trouble.
Am I a public servant?

00:23:36.875--> 00:23:39.730
I don't know you.
Where will I take you so late at night?

00:23:40.579--> 00:23:43.763
Take me anywhere you want.
Just for tonight.

00:23:43.848--> 00:23:45.326
Take me anywhere.

00:23:47.652--> 00:23:49.252
No, I won't be able
to take you anywhere.

00:23:52.011--> 00:23:53.193
I'm in big trouble.

00:23:54.026--> 00:23:55.675
Trouble? What trouble?

00:23:55.767--> 00:23:58.232
Two men have been
chasing me since evening.

00:23:58.317--> 00:23:59.363
Who are they?

00:23:59.726--> 00:24:01.911
I don't know.
But they seem to be policemen.

00:24:02.087--> 00:24:05.111
Police? Have you
committed a murder or something?

00:24:05.203--> 00:24:06.603
No, I haven't committed any murder.

00:24:06.801--> 00:24:10.881
I will tell everything to you.
Now, please go from here.

00:24:11.106--> 00:24:13.743
If they come, they will take
me away and they will think..

00:24:14.254--> 00:24:15.903
That you are helping me run away.

00:24:15.995--> 00:24:18.212
I am. Why will I run away with you?

00:24:18.304--> 00:24:20.097
They have come. Please hurry up.

00:24:42.376--> 00:24:43.376
Sheila.

00:24:45.593--> 00:24:47.719
Sheila, this is Dr. Digambar
Chatterjee.

00:24:47.980--> 00:24:48.980
Your friend's father.

00:24:49.908--> 00:24:50.954
Call her.

00:24:52.443--> 00:24:53.844
Nupur?

00:24:55.680--> 00:24:56.680
Nupur?

00:24:56.940--> 00:24:59.937
What is the problem?
Where is Nupur? Call her.

00:25:01.019--> 00:25:03.305
Nupur ran away again.

00:25:03.747--> 00:25:04.747
What?

00:25:05.303--> 00:25:07.654
Nupur? My God.

00:25:09.352--> 00:25:11.928
Nupur? My God. Nupur ran away again?

00:25:45.551--> 00:25:49.317
Anjan. Are you back?

00:25:49.495--> 00:25:50.543
Dundubhi. The landlord.

00:25:50.635--> 00:25:52.215
Landlord? I'm running away.

00:25:52.307--> 00:25:54.360
It's a problem. He has come.

00:25:55.113--> 00:25:58.704
I understand. I understand. She's..

00:25:59.058--> 00:26:00.686
I mean, your wife.

00:26:01.750--> 00:26:03.383
You think that I don't understand?

00:26:03.696--> 00:26:06.311
You should have told me earlier.

00:26:09.329--> 00:26:11.414
I understand. Understand.

00:26:15.329--> 00:26:19.857
Then I would have
made a few arrangements.

00:26:21.344--> 00:26:24.625
It is very late at night.
Take your wife upstairs.

00:26:24.717--> 00:26:25.927
Upstairs?

00:26:26.497--> 00:26:31.652
Yes, upstairs. Come up.
Come upstairs.

00:26:45.735--> 00:26:47.648
Your parents, brothers or sisters?

00:26:48.528--> 00:26:49.574
No one lives here.

00:26:53.585--> 00:26:54.613
Then I will leave.

00:26:54.701--> 00:27:00.821
Wait. Don't scared.
You might be a robber or a murderer.

00:27:01.575--> 00:27:03.425
But I have no choice
than to give you..

00:27:03.510--> 00:27:04.830
A place to stay for the night.

00:27:05.736--> 00:27:06.889
Otherwise, I won't
be able to show my..

00:27:06.913--> 00:27:08.220
Face to the landlord tomorrow.

00:27:08.244--> 00:27:12.629
You can trust me.
I'm neither a robber nor a murderer.

00:27:14.514--> 00:27:17.002
Then why are the
detectives after you?

00:27:19.626--> 00:27:21.775
I have run away from home.
- What?

00:27:24.082--> 00:27:25.911
You have run away?

00:27:27.120--> 00:27:30.297
Why? Tell me.

00:27:31.725--> 00:27:32.851
Due to the fear of marriage.

00:27:35.454--> 00:27:36.758
Are you trying to fool me?

00:27:36.946--> 00:27:38.560
Are women ever afraid of marriage?

00:27:38.645--> 00:27:39.789
It's only the men who feel scared.

00:27:39.813--> 00:27:42.861
Even women feel afraid
if they get grooms like mine.

00:27:43.410--> 00:27:47.202
What do you mean?
You please sit down.

00:28:00.033--> 00:28:05.015
What was your groom like?
African or Mongolian?

00:28:06.696--> 00:28:07.819
Bengali.

00:28:08.373--> 00:28:12.158
Bengali?
Bengali grooms become the wives.

00:28:13.113--> 00:28:14.361
Why were you afraid then?

00:28:15.107--> 00:28:19.776
I will tell you. I will trust
you and tell you everything.

00:28:19.868--> 00:28:20.922
What's your name?

00:28:21.346--> 00:28:22.392
Nupur Chatterjee.

00:28:23.348--> 00:28:24.394
House?

00:28:24.955--> 00:28:26.129
Delhi.

00:28:26.469--> 00:28:27.864
Delhi?

00:28:31.637--> 00:28:35.406
My mother is no more.
Father is Digambar Chatterjee.

00:28:36.253--> 00:28:37.909
A renowned surgeon of Delhi.

00:28:40.069--> 00:28:41.484
I used to study in college.

00:29:11.010--> 00:29:14.436
Uncle. What is this?

00:29:16.935--> 00:29:18.995
Can't you see both
my hands are engaged?

00:29:19.951--> 00:29:21.395
You are a strange man.

00:29:21.487--> 00:29:24.740
Listen, send me a
cup of coffee. Strong.

00:29:24.832--> 00:29:27.469
Okay.
- Listen to one more thing. Marriage.

00:29:28.514--> 00:29:31.905
Marriage? Whose?

00:29:31.997--> 00:29:33.043
Yours.

00:29:33.135--> 00:29:34.587
Mine? Seriously?

00:29:35.584--> 00:29:37.953
Brother-in-law has
selected the groom personally.

00:29:38.514--> 00:29:40.854
Father? Really?

00:29:40.946--> 00:29:41.946
Really.

00:29:43.109--> 00:29:47.313
Uncle, how is he?

00:29:47.660--> 00:29:51.269
Very grand, very grand.
Like honey. Very nice.

00:29:51.361--> 00:29:52.578
How are his looks?

00:29:52.670--> 00:29:53.831
Very nice, very nice.

00:29:54.979--> 00:29:55.864
Is he tall?

00:29:55.956--> 00:29:58.816
Yes. Quite tall.
About four-and-half feet.

00:29:59.618--> 00:30:02.978
Four-and-half feet?
I'm 5 feet 3 inches.

00:30:03.070--> 00:30:06.448
What has height got to do with it?

00:30:08.169--> 00:30:10.110
Complexion?

00:30:10.202--> 00:30:11.748
Complexion? Very dark.

00:30:12.128--> 00:30:15.024
But he has good brains.
He is a business magnate.

00:30:15.253--> 00:30:20.310
He has a medicine shop.
Hey, listen..

00:30:30.255--> 00:30:32.438
Has Ram Dhwani quit the job?

00:30:33.233--> 00:30:34.371
No.

00:30:35.016--> 00:30:36.777
Why did you bring the coffee then?

00:30:37.059--> 00:30:38.819
I had to talk to you
about something, Father.

00:30:39.598--> 00:30:40.644
You can speak.

00:30:42.334--> 00:30:44.578
Uncle Panu was saying that..

00:30:44.670--> 00:30:48.856
Yes, your marriage.
I have found a suitable boy.

00:30:49.541--> 00:30:52.982
He has good looks
and is very talented.

00:30:53.989--> 00:30:55.926
You must have heard
everything from Panu.

00:30:56.248--> 00:30:57.469
I will not marry, Father.

00:30:57.664--> 00:31:02.262
What? You have not
been a student of biology.

00:31:02.354--> 00:31:04.754
You didn't study biology that
is why you are saying all this.

00:31:05.290--> 00:31:07.337
I chose such a nice groom..

00:31:07.626--> 00:31:08.672
I didn't choose him.

00:31:11.005--> 00:31:12.613
What did you say? Choose?

00:31:13.156--> 00:31:15.275
Is a husband sari,
jewellery or vanity bag..

00:31:15.367--> 00:31:16.617
That you have to choose?

00:31:17.569--> 00:31:20.355
Your mother didn't choose and marry.

00:31:20.605--> 00:31:22.622
She married and then started liking.

00:31:23.037--> 00:31:24.301
You too will do that.

00:31:26.511--> 00:31:30.492
But my future, my principles?

00:31:30.582--> 00:31:35.872
Don't act smart. I understand
your future better than you.

00:31:37.556--> 00:31:41.035
And you are not a girl like
Tereskov to go into space.

00:31:41.328--> 00:31:42.905
And even she had married.

00:31:43.462--> 00:31:45.975
You too will marry, have children,
and bring them up.

00:31:46.064--> 00:31:47.451
That should be your principle.

00:31:49.801--> 00:31:50.847
Wait.

00:31:51.858--> 00:31:55.659
Your wedding day has been
fixed on the coming 28th.

00:32:11.112--> 00:32:12.717
Mother.

00:32:16.334--> 00:32:17.478
Mother.

00:32:18.528--> 00:32:20.414
I have been running
around since that day.

00:32:22.033--> 00:32:25.186
Tell me, did I do
anything wrong by not marrying..

00:32:25.278--> 00:32:27.518
My father's choice of groom?

00:32:29.825--> 00:32:34.458
Ms. Chatterjee,
I don't like the topic of marriage.

00:32:35.046--> 00:32:36.092
Marriage means riot.

00:32:36.915--> 00:32:38.858
I trusted you,
and I told you everything.

00:32:38.950--> 00:32:40.360
Will you hand me over?

00:32:40.452--> 00:32:43.432
Are you mad?
I will get stuck trying to hand you over.

00:32:44.355--> 00:32:47.040
Anyways?
Now, ashes will come out of my nose.

00:32:47.125--> 00:32:48.375
Ashes? Why?

00:32:48.467--> 00:32:51.905
My intestines are burning with hunger.
- Hunger?

00:32:51.997--> 00:32:54.385
Yes. Let's see what
the servant has left.

00:33:13.060--> 00:33:17.221
That is why I don't like girls.
Adding on every time.

00:33:17.857--> 00:33:20.464
Keep me in your car.
Keep me in your house. Give me food.

00:33:20.556--> 00:33:21.739
I can't bear all that.

00:33:23.062--> 00:33:24.342
You don't have to bear anything.

00:33:25.264--> 00:33:29.586
So much of anger.
Come and sit on the table.

00:33:30.001--> 00:33:31.082
You eat.

00:33:32.692--> 00:33:36.184
Won't I be cursed to keep
you in front of me and eat?

00:33:36.379--> 00:33:37.594
You want me to die?

00:33:38.963--> 00:33:40.057
Come on.

00:33:45.639--> 00:33:49.189
Jahar, do you remember the
number of the car in which..

00:33:49.406--> 00:33:52.361
Ms. Chatterjee ran away?

00:33:52.446--> 00:33:54.583
Sure and certain. I have written it.

00:33:57.201--> 00:33:59.275
WBC-2905.

00:33:59.470--> 00:34:02.033
Good, good.
You call the registration office.

00:34:02.790--> 00:34:04.970
Find out the name
and address of the owner.

00:34:05.392--> 00:34:07.232
You are asking me to call.
Is there connection?

00:34:07.394--> 00:34:09.295
There is till today.
They will disconnect tomorrow.

00:34:09.319--> 00:34:10.507
Okay.

00:34:12.865--> 00:34:13.865
WBC..

00:34:14.087--> 00:34:15.389
2905.

00:34:26.407--> 00:34:28.071
B-49, N Road.

00:34:28.429--> 00:34:31.628
Is anyone home? Is anyone home?

00:34:43.130--> 00:34:44.312
What is over there?

00:34:47.200--> 00:34:48.519
The pencil.

00:34:49.165--> 00:34:50.589
Pencil, I see.

00:34:51.474--> 00:34:52.584
Please, sit.

00:34:53.173--> 00:34:58.055
Whenever I come, Ghanta Ram says
you are not at home.

00:34:58.258--> 00:35:00.989
I can't stay.
The pressure of work is so much.

00:35:01.081--> 00:35:05.733
I can understand. I'm not leaving
without taking the rent.

00:35:06.486--> 00:35:08.066
I'm sitting here.

00:35:08.690--> 00:35:10.432
How many months' rent?

00:35:10.524--> 00:35:12.872
Taking this month, ten months' rent.

00:35:13.933--> 00:35:17.007
Only ten months?
I will give it. I will give it.

00:35:17.164--> 00:35:18.673
When will you give it?

00:35:18.949--> 00:35:22.079
After my death will you be doing a
money-order to the heaven?

00:35:23.742--> 00:35:26.623
You are getting excited.
Please check your pressure.

00:35:28.768--> 00:35:30.097
I will give it this time around.

00:35:30.377--> 00:35:33.300
Just let Rs.10,000
come into my hands.

00:35:33.849--> 00:35:34.914
What are you saying?

00:35:35.006--> 00:35:36.246
Yes. Do you think I'm bluffing?

00:35:37.190--> 00:35:39.481
Here, take a look. Look at this.

00:35:39.573--> 00:35:41.719
Read it. The case is in my hands.

00:35:47.039--> 00:35:49.393
If only you can catch that girl.

00:35:49.485--> 00:35:51.097
What do you mean can catch her?

00:35:51.778--> 00:35:54.247
We have caught her.
Clean catch, caught, caught.

00:35:55.578--> 00:35:57.432
You go home tension free.

00:35:57.665--> 00:36:00.366
We will send ten months rent,
two months' advance..

00:36:00.595--> 00:36:02.395
Within a couple of days.

00:36:02.487--> 00:36:05.584
Really. Then I'm going.

00:36:05.676--> 00:36:09.112
Yes. Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:36:13.578--> 00:36:14.779
What happened?

00:36:14.867--> 00:36:18.204
I have found it out.
WBC-2905 car number..

00:36:18.296--> 00:36:21.053
Anjan Mukherjee, famous singer.

00:36:21.394--> 00:36:24.498
Address is B-49, N Road,
New Alipore.

00:36:25.329--> 00:36:28.885
Finally, we found a trail.
You know Jahar?

00:36:28.977--> 00:36:29.782
What?

00:36:29.874--> 00:36:33.134
I feel Rs. 10,000 will
come into our hands.

00:36:33.513--> 00:36:35.872
It seems to be in our destiny.

00:36:36.291--> 00:36:39.411
Bhanu, you keep the Rs.10,000.

00:36:39.762--> 00:36:41.404
I want the princess
to fall in my destiny.

00:36:41.496--> 00:36:42.740
Destiny?

00:36:45.795--> 00:36:46.795
Hopeless.

00:36:47.352--> 00:36:48.479
Hopeless.

00:36:49.557--> 00:36:51.754
What is hopeless?
- Your servant's cooking.

00:36:54.174--> 00:36:55.019
Then what is this?

00:36:55.107--> 00:36:56.153
What?

00:36:56.442--> 00:36:58.173
Look, you have
licked the dish clean.

00:36:58.682--> 00:36:59.757
That is out of hunger.

00:37:01.447--> 00:37:02.834
Girls are exactly like this.

00:37:04.851--> 00:37:08.184
I bring you home in my car.
Let you eat from my share.

00:37:08.988--> 00:37:11.503
And now, there is
criticism at every step.

00:37:11.595--> 00:37:14.112
Okay, I will cook the food tomorrow.

00:37:49.189--> 00:37:51.042
Who is it?
- Open the door.

00:37:53.926--> 00:37:55.574
Open the door. It is me.

00:37:55.840--> 00:37:56.747
Who are you?

00:37:56.839--> 00:37:58.850
Open the door. It is me. Anjan.

00:38:02.489--> 00:38:04.183
What happened?
- Coming.

00:38:08.943--> 00:38:11.503
It is you.
- What happened? Did you fall asleep?

00:38:11.595--> 00:38:13.363
No. I thought..

00:38:13.576--> 00:38:14.895
What? That it's the detectives?

00:38:15.126--> 00:38:16.357
Something like that.

00:38:16.646--> 00:38:18.829
It is understandable.
After all, you are a fugitive.

00:38:19.515--> 00:38:21.060
Here is your sari and blouse.

00:38:22.229--> 00:38:24.906
Don't take anything if you
don't like it. My God, what taste!

00:38:25.256--> 00:38:28.682
I criticise like you.
How much did it cost?

00:38:29.851--> 00:38:32.171
Will you pay for it?
- Otherwise, you will give it or what?

00:38:32.462--> 00:38:35.317
Rich man's daughter,
that's why it is hurting your prestige.

00:38:36.045--> 00:38:37.979
It is your habit to
beat about the bush.

00:38:43.958--> 00:38:45.318
Send one cup of tea.

00:39:00.952--> 00:39:06.379
"The queen of nature
has woken me up.."

00:39:06.471--> 00:39:14.471
"with the golden
rays of the sun and.."

00:39:16.347--> 00:39:21.558
"sweet music of the flute."

00:39:21.904--> 00:39:27.232
"The queen of nature
has woken me up.."

00:39:27.526--> 00:39:35.526
"with the golden
rays of the sun and.."

00:39:37.346--> 00:39:42.579
"sweet music of the flute."

00:39:42.909--> 00:39:45.471
"The queen of nature.."

00:39:59.753--> 00:40:05.287
"I wake up and see that.."

00:40:05.379--> 00:40:10.670
"I have been given a garland."

00:40:10.909--> 00:40:16.119
"I wake up and see that.."

00:40:16.358--> 00:40:21.308
"I have been given a garland."

00:40:21.850--> 00:40:29.850
"I don't know his name,
but he looks known to me."

00:40:31.781--> 00:40:37.105
"The sweet music
woke me in my dreams."

00:40:37.384--> 00:40:39.932
"The queen of nature.."

00:40:54.128--> 00:40:59.450
"My heart blooms with joy.."

00:40:59.542--> 00:41:05.127
"and I see many dreams."

00:41:05.219--> 00:41:10.469
"My heart blooms with joy.."

00:41:10.788--> 00:41:15.877
"and I see many dreams."

00:41:16.291--> 00:41:24.291
"And I see only his dreams."

00:41:26.068--> 00:41:31.551
"The sweet music of the
flute woke my dreams."

00:41:39.880--> 00:41:45.478
"The queen of nature
has woken me up.."

00:41:45.570--> 00:41:53.570
"with the golden
rays of the sun and.."

00:41:55.339--> 00:42:00.853
"sweet music of the flute."

00:42:01.058--> 00:42:05.792
"The queen of nature.."

00:42:08.637--> 00:42:12.506
Good morning, Anjan. Hello.

00:42:13.080--> 00:42:15.698
Hello. I didn't exactly..

00:42:15.902--> 00:42:18.502
Recognise us.
You will recognise us. You will.

00:42:18.587--> 00:42:20.509
Let us sit first. Come.

00:42:22.086--> 00:42:23.501
If you have come to
invite me for a function..

00:42:23.525--> 00:42:24.702
Then I don't have any time.

00:42:24.726--> 00:42:26.037
Not for a function. Not a function.

00:42:26.061--> 00:42:28.779
Not for a function.

00:42:29.849--> 00:42:33.779
What then? Who are you?

00:42:35.188--> 00:42:40.985
I'm Bamkesh Chakraborty,
retired secretary Jute Regulations.

00:42:41.686--> 00:42:46.135
My name is Panchkuri
Ghosh the manager of..

00:42:46.227--> 00:42:48.527
That Royal Bengal Opera.

00:42:49.449--> 00:42:51.133
I can't sing for any opera.

00:42:51.225--> 00:42:54.199
You don't have to sing.
- We haven't come for that.

00:42:54.422--> 00:42:55.264
Then?

00:42:55.356--> 00:42:57.011
We have come to meet Nupur.

00:42:58.109--> 00:43:01.643
Nupur? Who is Nupur?

00:43:02.044--> 00:43:05.189
Where is she? Call her.

00:43:06.865--> 00:43:09.924
Call her. I want to see her.

00:43:11.136--> 00:43:12.561
How are you related to her?

00:43:13.038--> 00:43:18.258
I'm Nupur's uncle.
Digambar is my cousin.

00:43:19.319--> 00:43:21.073
Digambar Chatterjee?

00:43:21.772--> 00:43:24.658
I'm a distant relative on his
aunt's side. Panchkuri Ghosh.

00:43:25.278--> 00:43:26.563
Chatterjee's relative Ghosh?

00:43:27.547--> 00:43:30.265
It was a civil marriage.

00:43:30.626--> 00:43:31.626
Civil marriage?

00:43:32.085--> 00:43:35.078
How do you know that your niece?

00:43:35.350--> 00:43:37.759
Nupur had written a
letter from Delhi.

00:43:37.851--> 00:43:39.791
I don't even know her.
How can she write?

00:43:40.484--> 00:43:41.827
She had written with her own hands.

00:43:41.851--> 00:43:42.775
What? That she will
be putting up with me?

00:43:42.867--> 00:43:44.674
Yes.
- It can't happen. I don't believe it.

00:43:44.895--> 00:43:48.285
He doesn't believe it.
The wig is itching.

00:43:49.607--> 00:43:52.117
I am telling you that
she had written it herself.

00:43:53.573--> 00:43:55.578
Yes, I'm telling you that
she has written it herself.

00:43:55.602--> 00:43:57.129
Yes. She wrote it herself.

00:43:59.543--> 00:44:01.498
Do you believe us?

00:44:04.841--> 00:44:06.477
Yes, I do.

00:44:08.861--> 00:44:10.467
There it is.

00:44:13.920--> 00:44:15.640
It is full of bugs.

00:44:17.263--> 00:44:19.549
Who are you? And tell the truth.

00:44:19.999--> 00:44:21.045
Who are we?

00:44:26.513--> 00:44:28.117
Have you heard the
name of Detective Bhanu?

00:44:28.141--> 00:44:29.187
Detective?

00:44:29.886--> 00:44:32.325
I'm that person. I'm giving
competition to Robert Blake.

00:44:32.412--> 00:44:36.336
And I am assistant to the
great detective Bhanu, Jahar.

00:44:37.306--> 00:44:38.603
But why are you here?

00:44:41.829--> 00:44:45.008
No, no. Can you deny the fact
that you were running away..

00:44:45.202--> 00:44:49.175
In your car with
Nupur Chatterjee in your car.

00:44:49.431--> 00:44:51.218
I was running away?

00:44:51.310--> 00:44:53.014
Yes, you are the man?

00:44:53.099--> 00:44:54.145
Superman.

00:44:57.742--> 00:45:03.231
"I wake up and see that.."

00:45:03.408--> 00:45:08.433
"I have been given a garland."

00:45:08.942--> 00:45:14.633
"I don't know his name,
but he looks known to me."

00:45:17.168--> 00:45:18.073
Shall we?

00:45:18.165--> 00:45:21.177
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

00:45:21.614--> 00:45:23.116
Whichever detective you may be.

00:45:23.308--> 00:45:25.478
I will knock you out
with a single punch.

00:45:26.666--> 00:45:30.241
Even I know boxing.
I will take you..

00:45:30.333--> 00:45:31.516
Shut up.

00:45:31.975--> 00:45:35.153
I will deal with you later.
Let's go, Bhanu.

00:45:39.032--> 00:45:41.259
Again it started? Again it started?
- What happened?

00:45:42.179--> 00:45:43.257
Corollary.
- Corollary?

00:45:43.349--> 00:45:46.200
Yes. He gets an
attack every now and then.

00:45:46.285--> 00:45:49.698
Will he die? - Get a glass of water,
please. He might die.

00:45:49.790--> 00:45:50.910
Please get a glass of water.

00:46:10.470--> 00:46:12.693
Where did you send me?
That is the bathroom.

00:46:12.778--> 00:46:17.386
Bathroom? Do one thing.
Look over there.

00:46:20.477--> 00:46:23.202
I can't find her anywhere.
Who was singing?

00:46:23.721--> 00:46:26.168
Where will she go?
And who was singing.

00:46:28.935--> 00:46:31.245
There it is. Radio.

00:46:31.330--> 00:46:32.980
Radio?
- Radio? Look at us.

00:46:40.556--> 00:46:41.602
Where did she go?

00:46:43.326--> 00:46:46.273
Did they go? I'm saved.

00:46:46.696--> 00:46:48.275
Didn't you find any
other time to sing a song?

00:46:48.299--> 00:46:49.619
At least, they went away.

00:46:49.838--> 00:46:52.622
Hold this. Make some tea fast.
- Okay.

00:46:56.440--> 00:46:57.440
Are you there?

00:46:57.486--> 00:47:00.827
Who is it? Who came now?

00:47:01.072--> 00:47:03.464
Mr. Anjan, are you there?

00:47:05.180--> 00:47:06.429
Mr. Doondori?

00:47:06.988--> 00:47:08.294
I see I have woken
you up from your sleep.

00:47:08.318--> 00:47:09.882
No, I have been up for
quite sometime. Please sit.

00:47:09.906--> 00:47:11.146
Yes.

00:47:12.325--> 00:47:15.557
It happens when the
wife comes back home..

00:47:15.649--> 00:47:20.089
After a long time,
you will wake up early.

00:47:20.387--> 00:47:26.213
It happens to the best of us, sir.

00:47:26.873--> 00:47:30.325
Those were the days.
Those were the days.

00:47:31.318--> 00:47:33.184
Are you making tea?

00:47:33.477--> 00:47:34.523
Yes, I told her.

00:47:34.611--> 00:47:37.124
Tell sister-in-law to
make three cups of tea.

00:47:37.667--> 00:47:40.470
Sister-in-law?
- Yes, your wife.

00:47:41.896--> 00:47:43.870
You mean? Okay, Sister-in-law.

00:47:43.962--> 00:47:47.139
Yes, I'm her brother-in-law.

00:47:47.751--> 00:47:48.751
Brother-in-law?

00:47:48.843--> 00:47:50.535
We don't have much
difference in age.

00:47:50.627--> 00:47:54.005
It is only this bald
patch that I have got.

00:47:54.097--> 00:47:58.161
Otherwise, I'm very young in age.

00:47:58.433--> 00:48:00.341
There is not much
difference in our age.

00:48:06.589--> 00:48:09.534
Can you arrange me a servant?

00:48:09.711--> 00:48:11.492
Servant? Where is Bondul?

00:48:11.581--> 00:48:13.400
Bondul has gone on his vacation.

00:48:13.785--> 00:48:17.250
Bondul is not here?
So what? I am here.

00:48:17.342--> 00:48:18.694
I will do the work in your house.

00:48:18.786--> 00:48:19.689
What are you saying?

00:48:19.781--> 00:48:23.659
Shut up.
You want your wife to do the work?

00:48:23.751--> 00:48:25.959
No, I will not let this happen.
- Shut up.

00:48:26.051--> 00:48:27.310
At least, take your money.

00:48:27.397--> 00:48:29.202
Money is always there.
I will be back later.

00:48:37.569--> 00:48:38.615
I'm going.

00:48:40.639--> 00:48:41.685
Going?

00:48:42.705--> 00:48:44.336
You had given me
shelter for one night.

00:48:45.334--> 00:48:47.164
I will never forget
your gratefulness.

00:48:50.194--> 00:48:52.834
Females are so selfish.
So self-centred.

00:48:54.518--> 00:48:56.363
You are going away after
putting me into trouble.

00:48:56.387--> 00:48:57.433
What is the trouble now?

00:48:59.708--> 00:49:02.372
Does anyone's wife go
away after just one night?

00:49:03.527--> 00:49:05.837
You came last night.
If you go today..

00:49:06.091--> 00:49:08.513
Won't Mr. Doondori be suspicious?

00:49:09.041--> 00:49:10.986
That means a scandal
in the whole area.

00:49:13.170--> 00:49:14.455
Females are so self-centred.

00:49:16.473--> 00:49:18.353
The criticism of females
is always on your lips.

00:49:18.632--> 00:49:19.855
But tell me what shall I do?

00:49:20.543--> 00:49:22.857
Please stay here for a
few days and then go.

00:49:24.882--> 00:49:27.964
And where will you go?
There is police. Detectives.

00:49:28.275--> 00:49:30.355
The advertisement in the
papers given by your father.

00:49:30.515--> 00:49:34.345
Then how can I live here?
You don't trust girls a bit.

00:49:36.595--> 00:49:38.475
So, I will start trusting today.

00:49:39.544--> 00:49:44.345
Okay. I will also live for a
few days and repay your debt.

00:49:45.624--> 00:49:47.483
Good, good. Thank you.

00:49:47.742--> 00:49:48.890
Tea.

00:49:52.499--> 00:49:54.229
Did I spoil the moment?

00:49:59.772--> 00:50:03.073
The drama will get interesting.
What do you say?

00:50:06.545--> 00:50:08.346
Even I had seen these days, Brother.

00:50:09.217--> 00:50:11.174
Even I had such days.

00:50:15.564--> 00:50:17.756
Do you think that the police
is here to solve the fight..

00:50:17.780--> 00:50:19.340
Between father and daughter?

00:50:19.432--> 00:50:20.432
Then what?

00:50:21.055--> 00:50:23.275
This has happened because of you?

00:50:23.442--> 00:50:25.809
What? - As a father you try
to rule your daughter.

00:50:25.979--> 00:50:27.730
But can't you
understand her feelings?

00:50:33.995--> 00:50:37.905
Yes, Dubey. You are right.
You have said the right thing.

00:50:40.308--> 00:50:46.978
Dubey, I can understand
the anatomy of a human being.

00:50:47.606--> 00:50:48.983
I'm an expert on it.

00:50:51.237--> 00:50:52.872
But I have never
tried to understand the..

00:50:52.896--> 00:50:54.209
Feelings of my daughter.

00:50:55.648--> 00:50:57.695
I never understood Nupur's feelings.

00:50:59.776--> 00:51:00.992
You are right.

00:51:02.254--> 00:51:06.049
With Bondul gone,
you have got a nice job.

00:51:06.232--> 00:51:12.556
I like this job. Get me a real job.

00:51:14.566--> 00:51:16.755
Am I an employment
exchange or a deputy minister?

00:51:17.507--> 00:51:20.976
Why? You are such a famous singer.

00:51:21.334--> 00:51:23.387
You have contacts
with so many people.

00:51:24.198--> 00:51:26.574
How long will I be a
burden on your shoulders?

00:51:27.247--> 00:51:29.941
Arrange a job for me,
and I will go away.

00:51:32.556--> 00:51:38.014
If you have to go away,
then go to Delhi.

00:51:38.329--> 00:51:40.850
Delhi? Not anymore.

00:51:41.053--> 00:51:44.019
I will go there and father
will set me up with that man.

00:51:44.556--> 00:51:45.996
I have lost all
interest in marriage.

00:51:46.718--> 00:51:48.327
I will never marry in my life.

00:51:49.032--> 00:51:51.939
Good. I think on the same lines.

00:51:52.146--> 00:51:53.593
Why do you think on the same lines?

00:51:53.685--> 00:51:55.094
I will never marry in my life.

00:51:56.480--> 00:52:00.511
Even I had an obstacle
of marriage in my life.

00:52:01.129--> 00:52:02.870
Really? How?

00:52:04.015--> 00:52:05.270
I will eat and tell, okay?

00:52:06.750--> 00:52:07.884
Tell.

00:52:08.134--> 00:52:10.317
Yes, I am saying.
Let me light the cigarette.

00:52:20.656--> 00:52:23.203
I was born in Lucknow,
even though I..

00:52:23.392--> 00:52:25.746
Did my studies from Calcutta.

00:52:27.452--> 00:52:33.008
I always had one liking
since childhood. That was..

00:52:33.247--> 00:52:34.378
Music?

00:52:34.470--> 00:52:35.618
Right. Right.

00:52:36.717--> 00:52:41.528
After passing B.A.,
my music went full throttle.

00:52:42.512--> 00:52:44.999
Father.. No, father had
passed away by that time.

00:52:47.387--> 00:52:50.396
Anyway, I sang on the radio.
Released an album.

00:52:50.753--> 00:52:53.676
Got a call for films.
Everything was fine.

00:52:54.543--> 00:52:58.981
Then suddenly a
disaster struck my life.

00:52:59.473--> 00:53:00.473
Disaster?

00:53:00.504--> 00:53:05.332
Disaster! It came struck my life.
It is a feminine.

00:53:08.080--> 00:53:11.830
Nevertheless,
wherever I go to sing..

00:53:12.069--> 00:53:13.869
Hundreds of books
come forth for autograph.

00:53:14.210--> 00:53:15.850
My hands starting
pain after signing them.

00:53:17.615--> 00:53:20.424
I'm singing song after song.
My voice started cracking.

00:53:20.516--> 00:53:24.099
Still everything was okay.
And girls? Oh, my God.

00:53:24.566--> 00:53:27.370
All the different types
of girls in the world..

00:53:27.604--> 00:53:31.375
Fat, thin, tall,
short, arrogant, all types..

00:53:31.460--> 00:53:34.542
Would come and catch hold of me.

00:53:36.252--> 00:53:37.634
As if I was an offering from God.

00:53:43.506--> 00:53:46.521
Never mind, such fear of
women arose in my heart..

00:53:47.225--> 00:53:49.872
That I feel scared
on seeing young women.

00:53:50.727--> 00:53:52.675
That is why you got scared
on seeing me in the car?

00:53:52.699--> 00:53:54.461
Yes. No. I didn't get scared.

00:53:54.792--> 00:53:56.834
That night you..
- Don't disturb me.

00:53:59.279--> 00:54:00.807
What was I saying?
- The disaster.

00:54:01.089--> 00:54:06.359
Yes. I ran away from Kolkata..

00:54:06.868--> 00:54:10.782
Just to escape from these girls.

00:54:11.161--> 00:54:13.841
Where?
- Lucknow!

00:54:24.851--> 00:54:29.173
My luck. You remembered
your mother after so long.

00:54:31.085--> 00:54:35.005
I live alone.
This big house feels haunted.

00:54:36.177--> 00:54:37.973
This time around,
I'm not leaving in a hurry, Mother.

00:54:37.997--> 00:54:39.145
I'm going to live with you.

00:54:39.232--> 00:54:43.953
You will. You have to.
Who will take care of me if not you?

00:54:45.038--> 00:54:47.494
You are such a good son.

00:54:51.797--> 00:54:54.575
Wait a minute. What is the matter?

00:54:55.657--> 00:54:57.377
Suddenly you gave me such
a big certificate.

00:54:58.219--> 00:54:59.796
Marry and have a family.

00:55:00.526--> 00:55:03.540
Upon seeing this,
I can die in peace. What else?

00:55:04.111--> 00:55:05.448
Marriage?
- Yes, dear.

00:55:06.002--> 00:55:07.610
Why to go into those complications?

00:55:07.992--> 00:55:10.453
Let us go for a pilgrimage.
What do you say?

00:55:13.137--> 00:55:14.385
Come on.

00:55:14.477--> 00:55:16.425
What nonsense do you speak? Listen.

00:55:16.709--> 00:55:18.790
Your uncle has
brought a good proposal.

00:55:19.039--> 00:55:22.129
The girl is very nice.
Such girls don't come everyday.

00:55:22.214--> 00:55:25.569
Mother, I don't want a wife.
I don't want to get married.

00:55:25.935--> 00:55:27.164
What nonsense you speak?

00:55:27.470--> 00:55:31.668
Your uncle was saying
that the girl is very nice.

00:55:32.087--> 00:55:33.836
Besides that, I have given my word.

00:55:34.793--> 00:55:36.112
You have given your word?

00:55:36.528--> 00:55:38.245
Yes, I have given my word.

00:55:40.530--> 00:55:42.120
Where is uncle?
In the wrestling arena?

00:55:43.590--> 00:55:44.782
Okay.

00:55:57.967--> 00:55:59.965
'Marry and have a family.'

00:56:00.226--> 00:56:02.471
'Upon seeing this, I can die in peace.'

00:56:40.883--> 00:56:43.806
'Mother, I got my
teacher's advice in my dream.'

00:56:44.183--> 00:56:47.457
'I'm going into exile.
Your son, Anjan.'

00:56:50.747--> 00:56:55.513
Although my mother did not
advertise in the papers..

00:56:56.401--> 00:56:59.759
But still, we are more or
less floating in the same boat.

00:57:00.413--> 00:57:02.346
You are a male. What
will happen to you?

00:57:02.758--> 00:57:04.591
You can find a female
from your fan club..

00:57:04.683--> 00:57:05.683
And marry her.

00:57:07.385--> 00:57:08.506
Again?
- Why?

00:57:09.588--> 00:57:16.936
Somehow, I managed to
escape the disaster.

00:57:17.028--> 00:57:20.086
I'm happy with my music.

00:57:20.714--> 00:57:24.523
But I can't live without a job.
Arrange a job for me.

00:57:28.282--> 00:57:29.351
You will not get a job.

00:57:29.969--> 00:57:31.005
Why?

00:57:34.542--> 00:57:38.798
If during the job,
you get caught by the police..

00:57:40.619--> 00:57:43.286
Your photo has
become quite popular now.

00:57:45.957--> 00:57:47.524
Then there is no chance of a job.

00:57:49.785--> 00:57:51.352
I have to live as your burden?

00:57:52.748--> 00:57:54.185
Wait. Let me think a little.

00:58:06.305--> 00:58:09.068
You know how to sing, right?

00:58:09.938--> 00:58:10.938
You heard.

00:58:11.650--> 00:58:14.129
Yes, I heard. Your
voice sounds simple.

00:58:14.339--> 00:58:15.606
I had learnt it in Delhi.

00:58:17.550--> 00:58:18.673
Only singing?

00:58:18.924--> 00:58:21.881
No, I know a little bit of
dance as well. Little bit.

00:58:23.312--> 00:58:24.787
Good.

00:58:26.621--> 00:58:27.621
You will get a job.

00:58:28.232--> 00:58:29.874
I will? Where?

00:58:31.713--> 00:58:33.233
You will find out
when once you get it.

00:58:33.605--> 00:58:34.845
I will take you in the evening.

00:58:35.378--> 00:58:37.323
One, two, three, four.

00:58:39.756--> 00:58:46.837
"My heart is a flower,
the wind blows through my hair."

00:58:47.562--> 00:58:51.939
"You remain my only love, my dear."

00:58:52.031--> 00:58:53.336
No, it's not happening.

00:58:53.428--> 00:58:56.036
I'm singing correctly.
- It is not happening. Try it again.

00:58:56.221--> 00:59:01.582
"You remain my only love, my dear."
- Sing.

00:59:01.929--> 00:59:04.176
"You remain my only love, my dear."

00:59:04.268--> 00:59:05.278
It's not happening.

00:59:05.497--> 00:59:08.820
Not happening?
- No. Try again. Start.

00:59:08.912--> 00:59:16.912
"My heart is a flower,
the wind blows through my hair."

00:59:19.401--> 00:59:24.967
"You remain my only love, my dear."

00:59:25.216--> 00:59:26.856
It is not happening.
Nothing is happening.

00:59:27.714--> 00:59:28.969
Are the lyrics wrong?

00:59:29.061--> 00:59:30.637
No.
- Then?

00:59:33.011--> 00:59:34.781
Lyrics are just the
body not the song.

00:59:35.379--> 00:59:39.918
You have to feel the song.
You have no body. No soul.

00:59:42.525--> 00:59:44.918
Where is the feeling in your song?

00:59:45.206--> 00:59:46.697
It is not happening.

00:59:46.789--> 00:59:51.497
The way Lalita is singing,
will Mr. Anjan do..

00:59:51.589--> 00:59:54.262
Let it be. Let it be.

00:59:57.953--> 01:00:03.767
Then forget me.
I will not be able to work like this.

01:00:03.859--> 01:00:06.008
I'm not feeling well, sir.
I'm going.

01:00:09.164--> 01:00:13.316
Oh, God! My advance
booking has begun.

01:00:13.702--> 01:00:15.783
And you are saying
the heroine won't do.

01:00:16.146--> 01:00:18.291
Oh, God, what do I do?

01:00:20.665--> 01:00:23.028
Either get a new heroine,
or let me go.

01:00:23.584--> 01:00:24.828
What are you saying?

01:00:25.346--> 01:00:28.369
If I leave you,
my theatre will close down.

01:00:29.011--> 01:00:31.169
And where will I get
a new heroine now?

01:00:32.070--> 01:00:35.843
It is not a commodity that I
will go to the market and get.

01:00:36.416--> 01:00:37.645
She has to know how to sing..

01:00:37.908--> 01:00:39.148
She has to
know how to dance.

01:00:39.183--> 01:00:40.997
And on top of that, she has
to know how to be beautiful.

01:00:41.021--> 01:00:43.441
Where will I get such a heroine?

01:00:43.917--> 01:00:45.761
There is one.
- There is?

01:00:45.853--> 01:00:47.968
Will you see? I will get her.
- Yes, of course.

01:00:48.286--> 01:00:49.286
Wait for a minute.

01:00:52.126--> 01:00:54.727
The matter is almost done.

01:00:54.819--> 01:00:58.663
Done? - Yes. Do you remember
what I said? - Khushi Banu..

01:00:58.755--> 01:01:01.354
Khushi Banu, Faizabad.
Okay? Come on.

01:01:02.891--> 01:01:04.016
What Banu will you say?

01:01:04.405--> 01:01:06.499
No, no. Khushi Banu.
- Good. Come.

01:01:08.876--> 01:01:10.510
Look, sir. Will she do?

01:01:10.695--> 01:01:14.001
Hello. Please be seated.

01:01:18.021--> 01:01:19.067
Name?

01:01:19.923--> 01:01:20.969
Khushi Banu.

01:01:21.701--> 01:01:23.037
Where from?

01:01:23.874--> 01:01:24.791
Faizabad.

01:01:24.883--> 01:01:29.315
Faizabad? Do you know Bengali?

01:01:31.601--> 01:01:32.601
Yes, I know.

01:01:33.226--> 01:01:37.258
Khushi, my theatre is a Bengali one.

01:01:38.070--> 01:01:40.323
Yes, I have been in
Bengal for a long time.

01:01:40.761--> 01:01:41.992
I can speak in Bengali.

01:01:42.242--> 01:01:45.934
Then it is very good. Take the test.

01:01:46.880--> 01:01:52.522
Test?
- Yes, test. - Test. Oh, test?

01:01:53.572--> 01:01:58.511
Ms. Khushi, go to the green room.

01:01:58.717--> 01:02:01.922
I will be right there.
- Yes, take her there.

01:02:02.313--> 01:02:04.017
Accountant, take her.
- See you.

01:02:04.551--> 01:02:07.180
Come, Ms. Khushi.

01:02:12.530--> 01:02:17.688
Sir, will you be
making a contract today?

01:02:17.780--> 01:02:22.171
Of course.
Look, there are about five days.

01:02:22.719--> 01:02:25.970
You spend the night in rehearsals.

01:02:26.055--> 01:02:32.312
And I will spend everything
in publicity. Is it okay?

01:02:33.664--> 01:02:36.978
Khushi Banu.

01:02:50.217--> 01:02:53.396
Khushi Banu. The heart is
happy upon seeing the name.

01:02:54.607--> 01:02:57.340
Have you seen the face? What a gem?

01:02:59.893--> 01:03:00.778
Who is this?

01:03:00.870--> 01:03:01.956
A beauty.

01:03:02.048--> 01:03:04.687
I understood the
beauty part. But who is she?

01:03:04.779--> 01:03:06.374
Where is she from?

01:03:06.466--> 01:03:08.680
Yes, she has a name.

01:03:08.765--> 01:03:10.309
I went to the theatre
and found out everything.

01:03:10.333--> 01:03:12.250
Theatre? Why did you
go to the theatre?

01:03:12.335--> 01:03:14.883
A beautiful girl.
Wouldn't I want to find out about her?

01:03:15.109--> 01:03:18.087
Do you know what I found out?
She is from Faridabad.

01:03:18.174--> 01:03:20.459
Her mother is some Bai.

01:03:20.785--> 01:03:22.719
And she is very good
dancer and singer.

01:03:22.811--> 01:03:24.891
That is why Anjan Mukherjee
brought her into theatre.

01:03:25.381--> 01:03:26.427
Who brought her?

01:03:26.519--> 01:03:30.067
That guy. The musician.
Anjan Mukherjee.

01:03:30.386--> 01:03:31.626
Do you see the luck of the man?

01:03:32.055--> 01:03:34.944
All the beauties of
the world go to him.

01:03:39.260--> 01:03:40.978
Nothing like this has
ever happened to me.

01:03:41.531--> 01:03:44.380
Have you ever seen
this Khushi Banu before?

01:03:44.472--> 01:03:45.847
No.
- Yes, you have.

01:03:46.336--> 01:03:47.776
I'm telling you I have not seen her.

01:03:47.804--> 01:03:49.325
I have never gone to Faridabad and..

01:03:49.520--> 01:03:51.040
You are saying
that I have seen her.

01:03:51.074--> 01:03:53.462
Look properly.
You have seen her before.

01:03:53.650--> 01:03:57.130
No, I will never look at
a beautiful girl again.

01:03:57.402--> 01:03:58.906
If I look at the picture
of a beautiful girl..

01:03:58.930--> 01:04:01.595
The music of 'Calm September'
starts playing in my heart.

01:04:05.596--> 01:04:07.546
You can't be a detective. Quit it.

01:04:13.241--> 01:04:18.166
Look at this. Match this.
Look at this.

01:04:23.309--> 01:04:24.800
Bhanu, this is..

01:04:25.666--> 01:04:28.168
Yes, very doubtful case.

01:04:28.898--> 01:04:33.742
Now, I have to see if this
Khushi Banu is real or fake.

01:04:34.463--> 01:04:36.146
What theatre did you say?
- Ruby Theatre.

01:04:37.882--> 01:04:41.384
Ruby. Ruby Theatre.

01:05:24.194--> 01:05:31.732
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:05:31.824--> 01:05:35.753
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:05:37.830--> 01:05:44.143
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:05:45.539--> 01:05:49.484
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:06:17.799--> 01:06:24.781
"A rose has bloomed in this
heart is this romantic night."

01:06:25.247--> 01:06:33.045
"My veil flies in
the wind into the sky."

01:06:33.137--> 01:06:39.963
"A rose has bloomed in this
heart is this romantic night."

01:06:40.306--> 01:06:47.069
"My veil flies in
the wind into the sky."

01:06:49.830--> 01:06:56.846
"My heart calls out
the name of my lover."

01:06:59.712--> 01:07:06.088
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:07:07.409--> 01:07:11.008
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:07:39.561--> 01:07:46.467
"With his eyes, he has
targeted this heart of mine."

01:07:47.063--> 01:07:54.466
"And one day, he will
become the king of this heart."

01:07:54.558--> 01:08:01.710
"With his eyes, he has
targeted this heart of mine."

01:08:02.068--> 01:08:09.137
"And one day, he will
become the king of this heart."

01:08:09.592--> 01:08:16.857
"My heart beats fast and
calls out the name of my lover."

01:08:19.280--> 01:08:26.102
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:08:27.042--> 01:08:31.202
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:08:33.052--> 01:08:40.142
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:08:40.597--> 01:08:43.280
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:08:54.143--> 01:08:58.066
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:08:58.158--> 01:09:01.687
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:09:04.002--> 01:09:07.817
"The flower is blooming,
the moon is shining.."

01:09:07.909--> 01:09:11.406
"The night is dressed like a bride."

01:09:15.060--> 01:09:18.074
Where did you bring me?
- Be quiet. - What 'be quiet'?

01:09:18.499--> 01:09:22.725
What is this?
- Not this either.

01:09:24.435--> 01:09:26.840
Wear this.
- But this is a ladies costume.

01:09:26.932--> 01:09:29.251
And you will go and
dance with the girls.

01:09:29.341--> 01:09:31.126
I will dance with the girls.
But I am a man.

01:09:31.218--> 01:09:33.791
No, you'll look like a girl.
- Would I?

01:09:51.623--> 01:09:53.079
What happened?

01:09:53.298--> 01:09:55.579
Khushi Banu will change her
costume and come back. - Okay.

01:09:55.655--> 01:09:58.355
Don't let him come
out of stage. - Okay.

01:09:58.930--> 01:10:02.662
He is a brilliant artist.
Sign him up if you can. - Very good.

01:10:25.849--> 01:10:28.041
No more of this. We have to
run away from Kolkata tonight.

01:10:28.065--> 01:10:29.080
Come on, quick.

01:10:49.338--> 01:10:50.384
Are you ready?

01:11:06.380--> 01:11:07.501
Let's go.

01:11:08.123--> 01:11:10.102
What's this?
- Why?

01:11:10.953--> 01:11:12.170
You couldn't fool the detectives..

01:11:12.194--> 01:11:13.274
Dressed as Khushi Banu.

01:11:13.362--> 01:11:15.122
You think you will
fool them without make-up.

01:11:15.374--> 01:11:17.181
Shall I cover my face with the veil?

01:11:18.315--> 01:11:20.751
And what if the
police lift up the veil?

01:11:22.888--> 01:11:26.856
If I wear the Muslim
veil then will it do?

01:11:27.450--> 01:11:29.482
No, then they will
get more Suspicious.

01:11:29.677--> 01:11:32.429
Suddenly a veil.
Police aren't that stupid.

01:11:33.894--> 01:11:35.164
Then what shall we do?

01:11:38.554--> 01:11:39.733
Come with me into the room.

01:11:46.683--> 01:11:49.439
I knew this would come to use.
This will fit you.

01:11:49.531--> 01:11:52.401
What is it? - This is an old suit
of mine. I hoped it would be useful.

01:11:52.601--> 01:11:54.081
What will I do?
- You have to wear it.

01:11:54.302--> 01:11:56.155
I have to wear this?
- Yes.

01:11:56.943--> 01:11:59.752
But..
- No ifs and buts. Wear it fast.

01:12:23.353--> 01:12:24.578
Come in.

01:12:27.137--> 01:12:34.097
Very good. Something
is left. Come with me.

01:12:37.472--> 01:12:40.594
Don't mind it. Raise your head.

01:12:53.720--> 01:12:57.697
Very good. Now, see yourself.

01:13:05.407--> 01:13:08.493
Enough. Hurry up.
Come on. Quick.

01:13:13.749--> 01:13:16.894
Mr. Anjan, where are you going?

01:13:17.583--> 01:13:19.766
I'm going on a vacation.

01:13:20.019--> 01:13:21.501
Vacation? Where?

01:13:22.386--> 01:13:23.976
Nearby. Not too far. Lal Tila.

01:13:24.159--> 01:13:27.834
Lal Tila. Why alone?
Where is sister-in-law?

01:13:27.926--> 01:13:30.644
Sister-in-law? She has already gone.

01:13:31.034--> 01:13:33.115
Yes, she has gone.
And now I'm going.

01:13:34.159--> 01:13:37.915
What are you saying?
You are going on a honeymoon.

01:13:40.418--> 01:13:43.523
Honeymoon? No-no.
What are you saying? Honeymoon.

01:13:44.587--> 01:13:46.202
I'm going for a change. A change.

01:13:46.288--> 01:13:49.712
It is all the same.
Who is the foreigner with you?

01:13:50.062--> 01:13:52.546
He looks exactly like sister-in-law.

01:13:54.094--> 01:14:00.211
Yes. He is her relative.

01:14:00.569--> 01:14:05.654
Big family. I see.
Lot of resemblance.

01:14:07.294--> 01:14:10.664
Mr. Anjan, have you done your tickets?

01:14:11.109--> 01:14:12.109
Tickets?

01:14:12.141--> 01:14:13.597
For Lal Tila.

01:14:13.682--> 01:14:16.752
No, I'm going there by car.

01:14:16.844--> 01:14:20.200
You will be going by car? I see.

01:14:24.471--> 01:14:26.254
Make sure that nobody
comes to know that..

01:14:27.628--> 01:14:29.417
We are going to Lal Tila..

01:14:29.509--> 01:14:36.875
Don't worry.
What I hear once, I digest it.

01:14:36.967--> 01:14:38.970
Don't worry. Good bye.

01:14:44.224--> 01:14:46.271
God bless them.

01:14:52.200--> 01:14:56.242
Sir, listen to me. - What do you want?
- Is Mr. Anjan there? - Who?

01:14:56.334--> 01:15:00.978
Mr. Anjan? He just left on a
honeymoon a little while back.

01:15:01.173--> 01:15:02.739
Where?
- Honeymoon.

01:15:02.831--> 01:15:03.877
Can you tell us where he
has gone on a honeymoon?

01:15:03.901--> 01:15:06.199
He has gone to..
I can't say. I can't say.

01:15:06.720--> 01:15:10.075
It is very important.
- I can't say. I'm sorry.

01:15:10.167--> 01:15:15.345
Hold him. Hold him.
- What do you mean?

01:15:17.443--> 01:15:20.544
Are you trying to scare me?
I won't tell you.

01:15:20.772--> 01:15:21.880
Hopeless.

01:15:21.972--> 01:15:24.025
Please don't spoil this case for us.

01:15:24.117--> 01:15:28.719
Tell us where they have gone?
Delhi? Agra?

01:15:29.075--> 01:15:31.863
Delhi? Agra?
Kashmir? You have gone mad.

01:15:31.955--> 01:15:36.500
They have gone to Lal Tila,
and you are saying Kashmir.

01:15:36.592--> 01:15:39.935
But I will not tell you
where Mr. Anjan has gone.

01:15:43.189--> 01:15:47.079
Lal Tila? Where is Lal Tila, Bhanu?

01:15:47.431--> 01:15:48.708
That is in North Bengal.

01:15:48.795--> 01:15:53.015
That is very far.
Can we take our car over there?

01:15:53.867--> 01:15:58.258
I'm thinking of taking a
jeep from Aloke's garage.

01:15:58.696--> 01:15:59.818
Jeep.

01:16:01.141--> 01:16:02.255
Lal Tila.

01:16:02.609--> 01:16:03.757
Lal Tila.

01:16:51.146--> 01:16:54.297
Where have they gone?
Lal Tila or Neel Tila.

01:17:00.556--> 01:17:04.344
Do you see?
Where have Nupur and Anjan gone?

01:17:04.569--> 01:17:06.211
Neel Tila or Lal Tila.

01:17:07.162--> 01:17:08.795
I don't really know.

01:17:09.953--> 01:17:11.345
I will toss a coin.

01:17:15.779--> 01:17:16.881
Lal Tila.

01:18:00.015--> 01:18:01.868
The place is very beautiful,
isn't it?

01:18:05.499--> 01:18:07.934
Wouldn't it be good if we stayed
back here for a few days?

01:18:08.592--> 01:18:09.769
It will be very good.

01:18:10.593--> 01:18:12.300
But I can't stay
like a man any longer.

01:18:12.392--> 01:18:13.832
And won't draw
this moustache either.

01:18:13.890--> 01:18:15.115
It is very uncomfortable.

01:18:16.301--> 01:18:18.159
Why? It looks good on you.

01:18:18.420--> 01:18:20.854
My foot. I will wear a
sari from today itself.

01:18:26.505--> 01:18:28.891
If you want to wear a sari,
then at night.

01:18:30.473--> 01:18:31.664
Do you want me to
get handcuffed by..

01:18:31.688--> 01:18:32.959
Wearing a sari in day time.

01:18:33.048--> 01:18:34.299
You are a big coward.

01:18:34.391--> 01:18:36.903
Who will come to catch
me in this strange place?

01:19:02.696--> 01:19:03.742
What do you want?

01:19:04.840--> 01:19:05.671
Do you have any rooms available?

01:19:05.763--> 01:19:07.283
No, whatever we had
have been occupied.

01:19:07.597--> 01:19:11.119
The ones who have come,
are they a male and a female?

01:19:11.204--> 01:19:12.460
Two men have come.

01:19:12.645--> 01:19:16.449
Two men? How did you
know they are two men?

01:19:16.541--> 01:19:17.719
Will I not understand?

01:19:17.921--> 01:19:21.132
They might be in disguise.
I will come later.

01:19:22.267--> 01:19:25.766
They're here. - Who?
- Detective Bhanu. - Get up, run.

01:20:15.804--> 01:20:16.847
What is it?

01:20:16.939--> 01:20:18.126
A ladies handkerchief.

01:20:18.218--> 01:20:19.453
Ladies handkerchief.

01:20:20.008--> 01:20:21.054
What happened?

01:20:22.073--> 01:20:23.073
N.

01:20:23.425--> 01:20:24.725
N?

01:20:26.615--> 01:20:27.413
What name can it be?

01:20:27.505--> 01:20:31.510
N for.. it can be Nandita,
Nirmala, Neelima.

01:20:31.602--> 01:20:32.799
All these names.

01:20:34.224--> 01:20:35.535
Nupur.

01:20:36.397--> 01:20:42.951
Nupur? Sure and certain.
Pine yard Grove.

01:20:43.813--> 01:20:45.548
She is in this house.
- In this house?

01:21:00.671--> 01:21:02.782
Hello. Is there any girl
named Nupur Chatterjee over here?

01:21:02.806--> 01:21:04.089
She has come from Delhi.

01:21:04.174--> 01:21:06.062
Nupur Chatterjee? No.

01:21:06.276--> 01:21:08.804
You can't bluff us. We have proof.

01:21:08.896--> 01:21:10.656
You have proof? What proof?
- Show it to her.

01:21:13.346--> 01:21:15.084
This is my handkerchief.
Where did you get this?

01:21:15.108--> 01:21:18.740
Near the gate.
How can it be yours? What is your name?

01:21:18.832--> 01:21:20.141
Navtara.
- Navtara?

01:21:20.233--> 01:21:22.107
It's over.
- Why should your name be Navtara?

01:21:22.192--> 01:21:24.098
What rubbish?
- No, why should your name be Navtara?

01:21:24.122--> 01:21:25.472
Father.

01:22:30.107--> 01:22:36.762
"The eyes of night
have kohl of drowsiness."

01:22:37.527--> 01:22:42.299
"And my eyes are open."

01:22:42.419--> 01:22:47.037
"The eyes of night
have kohl of drowsiness."

01:22:47.157--> 01:22:51.309
"And my eyes are open."

01:22:51.612--> 01:22:56.686
"But these days I stay
awake alone to listen to.."

01:22:56.942--> 01:23:00.418
"the sound of the early bird."

01:23:01.007--> 01:23:05.481
"The eyes of night
have kohl of drowsiness."

01:23:05.573--> 01:23:09.993
"And my eyes are open."

01:23:18.336--> 01:23:26.336
"But these days I stay
awake alone to listen to.."

01:23:27.584--> 01:23:35.584
"the sound of the early bird."

01:23:41.147--> 01:23:49.147
"But these days,
I stay awake alone to listen to.."

01:23:50.730--> 01:23:58.730
"the sound of the early bird."

01:23:59.530--> 01:24:07.530
"Oh, friend,
I wish this night does not end."

01:24:08.665--> 01:24:16.665
"Oh, friend,
I wish this night does not end."

01:24:18.466--> 01:24:26.466
"The kohl of sleep is
put on my eyes at night."

01:24:27.598--> 01:24:33.308
"The eyes of night
have kohl of drowsiness."

01:24:33.400--> 01:24:36.976
"And my eyes are open."

01:24:45.092--> 01:24:53.092
"So many songs are
heard in my dreams."

01:24:54.243--> 01:25:02.243
"And the smell of honey is
carried by the pleasant wind."

01:25:07.892--> 01:25:15.892
"So many songs are
heard in my dreams."

01:25:17.071--> 01:25:25.071
"And the smell of honey is
carried by the pleasant wind."

01:25:26.113--> 01:25:34.113
"Oh, friend,
I wish this night does not end."

01:25:35.161--> 01:25:43.161
"Oh, friend,
I wish this night does not end."

01:25:45.028--> 01:25:53.028
"This is the joy of life."

01:25:54.038--> 01:25:58.594
"The eyes of night
have kohl of drowsiness."

01:25:58.779--> 01:26:03.178
"And my eyes are open."

01:26:03.270--> 01:26:08.594
"The kohl of sleep is
put on my eyes at night."

01:26:08.686--> 01:26:12.410
"This is what I really like."

01:26:12.502--> 01:26:16.930
"The eyes of night
have kohl of drowsiness."

01:26:17.137--> 01:26:22.423
"And my eyes are open."

01:26:28.086--> 01:26:29.132
Why didn't you sleep?

01:26:30.904--> 01:26:31.904
I'm not feeling sleepy.

01:26:34.277--> 01:26:35.277
Why?

01:26:37.019--> 01:26:38.372
Mosquitoes.

01:26:41.205--> 01:26:42.205
You didn't sleep?

01:26:44.085--> 01:26:45.085
Bedbugs.

01:26:45.244--> 01:26:46.244
What?

01:27:21.005--> 01:27:24.224
Look. That car.

01:27:27.605--> 01:27:28.691
Correct number.

01:27:28.783--> 01:27:30.263
You go from here.
I will go from here.

01:27:32.732--> 01:27:34.502
Have you ever seen such
beautiful moon?

01:27:36.122--> 01:27:39.448
Yes, in the veranda of
this Woodland Hotel.

01:27:58.187--> 01:28:00.769
Bhanu, the doors are closed.
How will we enter?

01:28:03.074--> 01:28:04.114
Get the rope from the car.

01:28:04.181--> 01:28:05.473
The rope?

01:28:14.056--> 01:28:15.655
Listen.
- I'm coming.

01:28:18.508--> 01:28:21.774
What happened?
- Look, there's someone down there.

01:28:27.884--> 01:28:28.884
You go up.

01:28:28.997--> 01:28:30.298
Me?
- Yes.

01:28:37.513--> 01:28:39.526
Who is it? Who is down there?

01:28:41.483--> 01:28:42.272
It's me.

01:28:42.364--> 01:28:46.434
Me? Who me? Answer me or else..

01:28:47.300--> 01:28:50.715
What are you doing?
I will fall down. I'm Jahar.

01:28:51.240--> 01:28:54.288
Detective Bhanu's assistant.
I have come to catch you.

01:28:56.612--> 01:29:00.468
What will happen now?
They will catch us. Oh, God.

01:29:01.284--> 01:29:02.644
Let's run away immediately.
- Okay.

01:29:02.869--> 01:29:04.658
They are getting away.

01:29:04.750--> 01:29:07.110
I will catch them from the other side.
- You're going there?

01:29:07.518--> 01:29:09.167
Quick.
- Let me wear my suit.

01:29:09.259--> 01:29:11.011
There is no time.
Wear it on the road.

01:29:12.361--> 01:29:13.407
What will happen?

01:29:14.902--> 01:29:18.477
No need to open the sari.
Hurry up. Detective Bhanu.

01:29:23.024--> 01:29:24.673
Where are you going?

01:29:24.993--> 01:29:25.734
Upstairs.

01:29:25.826--> 01:29:28.140
Upstairs? - Yes. Why?
- To catch a thief.

01:29:28.263--> 01:29:31.186
To catch a thief? - Yes.
- Are you trying to fool Ram Singh?

01:30:01.108--> 01:30:07.264
I have caught him.
Bhanu, I have caught him.

01:30:07.356--> 01:30:08.393
Come quickly.

01:30:08.643--> 01:30:14.123
Bhanu, come fast. Bhanu, come fast.

01:30:16.228--> 01:30:18.837
It's you?
I thought it was Nupur Chatterjee.

01:30:18.929--> 01:30:24.383
Nupur Chatterjee.
Idiot. Follow me, quick.

01:30:32.979--> 01:30:36.459
Anjan Mukherjee's car?
Where did they go?

01:32:17.737--> 01:32:22.321
Why have you blocked the
road with the elephant?

01:32:31.577--> 01:32:34.159
Because of you, even I have
to run around like a thief.

01:32:34.377--> 01:32:35.576
What do you mean?

01:32:35.668--> 01:32:36.994
I mean that there are
thieves in the back and..

01:32:37.018--> 01:32:38.378
I don't know where to go ahead.

01:32:38.700--> 01:32:42.562
Fine. When I'm creating
so much of trouble for..

01:32:42.787--> 01:32:43.813
You then stop the car.

01:32:43.905--> 01:32:45.127
I will get down.

01:32:45.219--> 01:32:46.483
Nupur.

01:32:46.575--> 01:32:47.586
What?

01:32:47.678--> 01:32:50.842
I just called you by your name.

01:32:51.090--> 01:32:53.234
So, what happened?
- Okay.

01:32:53.480--> 01:32:56.872
Nupur, are both of us very foolish?

01:32:57.868--> 01:32:58.914
Why?

01:32:59.036--> 01:33:02.391
I mean, why we are running
away from detective Bhanu?

01:33:02.873--> 01:33:04.033
What other option do we have?

01:33:05.009--> 01:33:08.057
I mean, we both are adults. Right?

01:33:08.462--> 01:33:09.369
That is true.

01:33:09.461--> 01:33:14.503
Then.. why don't we.. I mean..
you know.. get married?

01:33:15.425--> 01:33:16.632
Married?
- Yes.

01:33:17.198--> 01:33:18.467
What are you saying?

01:33:18.622--> 01:33:20.277
The thing I have
been running away from..

01:33:20.369--> 01:33:22.037
Will I step into that very thing?

01:33:22.159--> 01:33:24.138
No, I mean this is not that marriage.
- Then?

01:33:24.230--> 01:33:27.783
You were supposed to be
married to the businessman.

01:33:28.160--> 01:33:29.845
Am I a businessman?
- Shut up.

01:33:32.333--> 01:33:36.137
My marriage was fixed to a girl
with artificial teeth and a wig.

01:33:38.226--> 01:33:41.111
Do you have artificial teeth?

01:33:41.955--> 01:33:43.025
Stop joking.

01:33:46.993--> 01:33:48.039
What do you want?

01:33:48.495--> 01:33:50.314
We want that?

01:33:50.964--> 01:33:54.046
What do you want?
- We want to get married.

01:33:55.168--> 01:33:56.214
Want to get married?

01:33:56.420--> 01:33:58.622
Yes.
- Yes.

01:33:59.220--> 01:34:01.994
Sit down. Sit down.

01:34:09.282--> 01:34:11.500
You want to get married?
- Yes.

01:34:13.386--> 01:34:15.001
Have you won a lottery?

01:34:15.288--> 01:34:17.506
What do you mean by lottery?

01:34:17.624--> 01:34:21.791
I mean, that without the support
of at least a few lakh rupees..

01:34:22.009--> 01:34:25.351
Does anyone want to
get married these days?

01:34:25.598--> 01:34:29.434
The price of vegetables has risen.
Will you eat or sell?

01:34:29.641--> 01:34:32.455
I will eat.

01:34:35.954--> 01:34:38.461
I mean, I haven't won a lottery.

01:34:39.132--> 01:34:41.025
But I earn a living.
- Oh. - Yes.

01:34:41.349--> 01:34:44.128
That is why we want to
be husband and wife.

01:34:44.960--> 01:34:46.873
I understood that.

01:34:47.412--> 01:34:49.561
But do you know what
a domestic animal is?

01:34:49.748--> 01:34:56.266
Yes, I know that.
It means dog, cow, goat.

01:34:56.388--> 01:35:04.388
Wrong answer.
Domestic animal means ideal husband.

01:35:06.133--> 01:35:08.835
You will eat less,
but give more milk.

01:35:09.917--> 01:35:11.553
I mean earn more.

01:35:12.771--> 01:35:14.351
One more thing, young man.

01:35:15.095--> 01:35:18.762
Never tell your wife
that you love her.

01:35:19.244--> 01:35:22.724
If you say so,
you will have to pay taxes.

01:35:22.848--> 01:35:23.581
Will you remember?

01:35:23.673--> 01:35:30.089
Yes. I mean no.
Yes, I will remember.

01:35:30.489--> 01:35:32.342
I will never mention it to her.

01:35:33.291--> 01:35:35.543
Now, please get us
married soon, sir.

01:35:35.660--> 01:35:36.900
How can I get you married soon?

01:35:37.262--> 01:35:40.132
It takes one month's
notice for civil marriage.

01:35:40.641--> 01:35:45.524
One month? We can't wait one month.

01:35:45.637--> 01:35:47.320
We need to get married today itself.

01:35:47.830--> 01:35:49.628
Please find a way out, sir.

01:35:49.741--> 01:35:53.105
I understood. Readymade marriage?

01:35:53.197--> 01:35:54.727
Yes, readymade.

01:35:54.946--> 01:35:57.602
There is provision for that as well.
- Really?

01:35:58.068--> 01:36:01.863
I will call a priest and
make you wear a turban.

01:36:02.155--> 01:36:04.306
But I will take double fees.

01:36:04.782--> 01:36:07.374
Sir, I'm ready to treble your fees.

01:36:07.626--> 01:36:08.911
It is a readymade marriage.

01:36:09.027--> 01:36:10.976
You will treble my fees? Treble?

01:36:29.972--> 01:36:34.985
Nupur? Our marriage
seemed like a game of lottery.

01:36:35.077--> 01:36:36.123
Isn't it?

01:36:37.600--> 01:36:39.231
Did you win or lose in the lottery?

01:36:41.017--> 01:36:44.304
You tell me.
- I won't say. First, you say.

01:36:45.054--> 01:36:46.100
First, your say.

01:37:08.418--> 01:37:10.698
Sir! Sir!

01:37:16.429--> 01:37:18.644
Bhanu, without finding
out anything..

01:37:18.840--> 01:37:20.120
You sent a telegram to Delhi?

01:37:21.412--> 01:37:22.082
What do you mean I didn't find out?

01:37:22.174--> 01:37:23.934
I have found out
everything and have sent a..

01:37:24.004--> 01:37:24.871
Telegram to Nupur's father.

01:37:24.963--> 01:37:26.071
He is coming tomorrow.

01:37:26.247--> 01:37:27.154
How do you know?

01:37:27.246--> 01:37:28.461
He sent a telegram.

01:37:40.547--> 01:37:43.629
You sent a telegram to
the gentleman to come.

01:37:43.750--> 01:37:45.069
But how will you recognise him?

01:37:45.185--> 01:37:49.610
I told him in the telegram
to put a red rose in his suit.

01:37:50.724--> 01:37:52.976
Bhanu, you are a genius.
- Yes.

01:37:53.093--> 01:37:56.073
To become a detective,
you have to use your intellect.

01:38:18.034--> 01:38:19.594
Good morning, gentlemen?
- Good morning.

01:38:19.695--> 01:38:21.315
We are waiting for you?

01:38:22.071--> 01:38:23.549
For me?
- Yes. Why?

01:38:23.673--> 01:38:25.867
I told you that in the telegram.

01:38:27.176--> 01:38:28.597
You must be making a mistake?

01:38:28.905--> 01:38:30.083
What are you saying?

01:38:30.380--> 01:38:33.357
Robert Blake can make a mistake,
not Bhanu Roy.

01:38:33.449--> 01:38:36.027
The red rose on your
suit proves that you got..

01:38:36.119--> 01:38:39.209
My telegram,
put the rose and got off the plane.

01:38:39.458--> 01:38:40.568
Now, come with me.

01:38:41.091--> 01:38:43.638
Where?
- To take you to your lost daughter.

01:38:43.793--> 01:38:48.582
What? My daughter is lost?
Here is my daughter.

01:38:49.299--> 01:38:50.345
She is so jolly.

01:38:51.783--> 01:38:55.180
I understood. You are thugs.
I will inform the police.

01:38:55.305--> 01:38:57.124
Come, dear. Police. Police.

01:38:58.374--> 01:39:01.422
His daughter is not lost.
We got a wrong number.

01:39:11.821--> 01:39:13.743
Did you see?

01:39:16.807--> 01:39:17.976
This time around, you go.

01:39:18.874--> 01:39:20.331
What if there is a
wrong number again?

01:39:20.355--> 01:39:22.726
No, no. Go on.
- Shall I?

01:39:22.846--> 01:39:24.597
Why are you worried,
I'm here with you? Go.

01:39:24.715--> 01:39:26.500
If you say so. Then I will go.

01:39:27.394--> 01:39:29.835
You must be Dr. Digambar Chatterjee?
- Yes.

01:39:30.442--> 01:39:33.371
Thank you. Bhanu.
It's not a wrong number.

01:39:33.463--> 01:39:34.463
Come here fast.

01:39:34.511--> 01:39:35.587
Who are you?

01:39:35.911--> 01:39:38.782
I will answer.
Dr. Digambar Chatterjee.

01:39:38.972--> 01:39:42.982
And he is the great, greater,
greatest Detective Bhanu.

01:39:43.074--> 01:39:44.389
And I'm his assistant Jahar.

01:39:45.622--> 01:39:48.272
You don't seem like detective to me.

01:39:48.592--> 01:39:50.309
That's our disguise.

01:39:51.243--> 01:39:52.544
Where is my daughter?

01:39:52.636--> 01:39:53.742
She is here.

01:39:53.864--> 01:39:54.910
Where's she?

01:39:54.998--> 01:39:56.141
Why are you getting impatient?

01:39:56.165--> 01:39:57.765
She is here. We have a car.
Come with us.

01:40:05.901--> 01:40:07.500
Is this your car?

01:40:07.592--> 01:40:10.724
Yes. Just like detective
Bhanu is a classic in India.

01:40:10.847--> 01:40:13.240
The car is also a classic. Hop in.

01:40:13.619--> 01:40:16.835
Not over there. On the stool.

01:40:17.598--> 01:40:20.576
Oh, my God. On that stool?
- Yes.

01:40:30.700--> 01:40:32.519
We could have gone in my car.

01:40:32.611--> 01:40:36.828
Hey, Jahar.
You'll have to push the car.

01:40:36.920--> 01:40:39.628
What? - Push the car.
- Push the car?

01:40:40.732--> 01:40:42.623
What is this?
- Don't mind.

01:40:44.214--> 01:40:45.360
Frustrating.

01:41:39.823--> 01:41:40.869
Whom do you want?

01:41:41.125--> 01:41:43.377
Are you Anjan Mukherjee?
- Yes. And you are?

01:41:43.655--> 01:41:45.870
Where is my daughter? Where's she?

01:41:45.962--> 01:41:47.202
What do you mean your daughter?

01:41:47.264--> 01:41:49.882
You must have hidden my daughter.

01:41:49.974--> 01:41:52.420
Where is my daughter? Tell me.
Where is my daughter?

01:41:52.536--> 01:41:56.392
I don't know you, sir.
How will I know your daughter?

01:41:56.607--> 01:41:57.790
What an awkward situation.

01:41:58.315--> 01:42:00.994
Shut up. You liar.

01:42:01.178--> 01:42:03.430
If you know what's good for you,
give me my daughter.

01:42:05.049--> 01:42:06.334
Oh, what a pest he is.

01:42:07.851--> 01:42:12.037
Listen, sir. No one but my
wife stays here with me.

01:42:12.156--> 01:42:13.716
You don't have
anyone besides your wife?

01:42:14.023--> 01:42:15.479
You again?

01:42:15.959--> 01:42:19.113
Yes, we again. Call your wife.
Please call her.

01:42:19.320--> 01:42:23.014
Yes, call her. I have to identify her.
- Yes.

01:42:23.133--> 01:42:26.557
But she is not here.
She has gone to the market.

01:42:26.837--> 01:42:31.125
She has gone to the market?
Mr. Anjan, you are a sly fox.

01:42:31.383--> 01:42:34.026
And a sly fox with an elephant.

01:42:34.144--> 01:42:36.032
Shut up. With a hen.
- Hen.

01:42:37.247--> 01:42:43.216
Listen, boy, give me
my daughter or else..

01:42:43.308--> 01:42:45.825
I will hand you to the police.

01:42:45.917--> 01:42:49.045
I will charge you with kidnapping.

01:42:49.193--> 01:42:51.209
You idiot.

01:42:51.642--> 01:42:54.375
You loafer.

01:42:54.465--> 01:42:57.803
How dare you say?
- What? How dare you say?

01:42:58.875--> 01:43:00.023
What?

01:43:00.799--> 01:43:04.293
Anjan. - Mother.
- Anjan.

01:43:04.745--> 01:43:05.680
Mother.

01:43:05.765--> 01:43:06.909
Anjan, what you have
written in the telegram..

01:43:06.933--> 01:43:08.291
Is it the truth?
- Yes.

01:43:08.478--> 01:43:12.466
So you got married?
Whom did you marry and when? - Yes.

01:43:12.551--> 01:43:14.971
Without my permission, you got married?
- I..

01:43:15.141--> 01:43:16.824
You estranged me?

01:43:17.126--> 01:43:18.246
Had your father been alive..

01:43:18.310--> 01:43:19.607
Would you still have
estranged me like this?

01:43:19.631--> 01:43:21.481
Oh, no. Mother.
Mother, why are you crying?

01:43:21.717--> 01:43:24.586
Don't cry. - Just because
your father is no more..

01:43:24.671--> 01:43:26.292
When did I estrange you? - That's why
you married without telling me.

01:43:26.316--> 01:43:30.578
I found you such a good bride.
- The girl I got married to is good too.

01:43:30.663--> 01:43:34.182
She is a good girl.
You will like her if you see her.

01:43:35.390--> 01:43:36.445
There she comes.

01:43:37.515--> 01:43:41.049
Take this.
- There you are.

01:43:42.239--> 01:43:43.285
Father.

01:43:44.274--> 01:43:47.784
So, this witch brainwashed you.

01:43:47.979--> 01:43:49.499
And because of this witch,
you didn't..

01:43:49.547--> 01:43:51.152
Marry the girl of my choice?

01:43:51.244--> 01:43:53.084
Dare you. Dare you. -
You've shamed the family.

01:43:53.123--> 01:43:54.299
Excuse me, madam.

01:43:54.554--> 01:43:57.389
You have no right to
call my daughter a witch.

01:43:57.481--> 01:44:00.113
In fact, your son is a monster.

01:44:00.205--> 01:44:01.889
Listen, Mother, what
he's saying. - What?

01:44:01.975--> 01:44:05.184
My darling son is a monster?

01:44:05.276--> 01:44:06.458
Yes, he is a monster.

01:44:06.544--> 01:44:09.829
Not only is he a monster,
your son is an Orangutan. - Mother.

01:44:09.921--> 01:44:12.527
And your daughter is a bedlam.

01:44:12.617--> 01:44:15.332
Dare you call my daughter anything?

01:44:15.424--> 01:44:18.370
Mother, she's my wife.
That is my wife.

01:44:19.107--> 01:44:22.046
What is happening here?
Will you start rioting?

01:44:22.138--> 01:44:27.275
Shut up. My daughter
is being disrespected?

01:44:27.897--> 01:44:32.252
Dr. Digambar Chatterjee
has never been dishonoured.

01:44:33.150--> 01:44:35.614
What name did he say?
What was the name?

01:44:35.706--> 01:44:38.988
Digambar. Dr. Digambar Chatterjee.
- Dr. Digambar Chatterjee.

01:44:39.110--> 01:44:42.261
Ask him whether he stays in Delhi?
- Do you..

01:44:42.589--> 01:44:46.848
Yes. Number 13, Daryaganj. So what?

01:44:46.940--> 01:44:52.307
What a coincidence? Don't mind,
we fought for no reason.

01:44:52.590--> 01:44:57.993
We have made a grave mistake.
- Grave mistake?

01:45:00.232--> 01:45:03.993
Your daughter's wedding was
fixed with my son. - What?

01:45:04.085--> 01:45:05.798
Tell him. Tell him
your father's name.

01:45:05.890--> 01:45:08.318
Father's name is
late Avinash Mukherjee.

01:45:08.719--> 01:45:10.934
Late who?
- Avinash Mukherjee.

01:45:11.026--> 01:45:13.429
A resident of Lucknow?
- Yes.

01:45:14.041--> 01:45:15.621
What a coincidence?

01:45:15.854--> 01:45:19.531
Why didn't you tell me
that you are Avinash's son?

01:45:19.647--> 01:45:23.052
I didn't get a chance to
say anything. You came and..

01:45:25.054--> 01:45:29.672
How strange. I wanted to
make you my son-in-law.

01:45:30.665--> 01:45:34.064
Nupur, if you had to marry Anjan..

01:45:34.156--> 01:45:35.976
Then why did you
run away from home?

01:45:37.227--> 01:45:41.387
Uncle Panu said that the
groom is short and dark.

01:45:41.479--> 01:45:46.631
Your uncle Panu is a fool.

01:45:47.441--> 01:45:48.552
You ran away from home based..

01:45:48.576--> 01:45:49.978
On what uncle Panu said?

01:45:50.070--> 01:45:51.425
Uncle Panu said such things.

01:45:51.545--> 01:45:52.665
Uncle Panu said such things.

01:45:52.751--> 01:45:54.701
Now, pay respect to
your mother-in-law.

01:45:54.815--> 01:45:55.861
Come, dear.

01:45:56.136--> 01:45:59.562
God bless you. I wanted a
daughter-in-law like this.

01:45:59.654--> 01:46:02.776
Your prayers have been answered.
- So you agree she's not a witch.

01:46:02.868--> 01:46:04.069
No, no.

01:46:04.358--> 01:46:07.338
Bhanu, don't I have any chance?

01:46:07.714--> 01:46:08.714
What kind of a chance?

01:46:08.957--> 01:46:09.957
To get a beauty.

01:46:09.997--> 01:46:11.691
I will strangle you to death.

01:46:11.783--> 01:46:14.188
We have to wait for
our money. Rs.10,000.

01:46:16.864--> 01:46:21.443
Let it be. Don't mind me for calling
you a monster. - No, no. I was..

01:46:21.535--> 01:46:22.761
I am very happy.

01:46:23.551--> 01:46:25.219
Even we are very happy.

01:46:31.562--> 01:46:32.764
I was saying that you
were saved from the..

01:46:32.788--> 01:46:34.415
Expenditures of marriage.

01:46:34.507--> 01:46:36.566
So, please increase the amount.

01:46:38.525--> 01:46:41.803
Exactly. My friends, you
have done well for yourself.

01:46:42.016--> 01:46:43.270
You deserve it.

01:46:44.358--> 01:46:49.374
I will write a cheque of
10,000 and I will add the rest.

01:46:51.054--> 01:46:56.956
Wait. I remember
what I had advertised.

01:46:57.195--> 01:46:59.153
I had written in the
advertisement that..

01:46:59.240--> 01:47:01.162
The one who manages
to find my daughter..

01:47:01.254--> 01:47:03.214
Ms. Nupur Chatterjee,
I will give that person..

01:47:03.244--> 01:47:05.378
Rs.10,000 as reward.

01:47:05.574--> 01:47:06.956
We found her.
- No. - No?

01:47:07.048--> 01:47:08.102
No, you didn't find her.

01:47:08.194--> 01:47:11.918
Firstly, the girl you
found is Mrs., not a Ms.

01:47:12.168--> 01:47:17.166
Secondly,
she is Mrs. Nupur Mukherjee not..

01:47:17.258--> 01:47:18.858
Ms. Nupur Chatterjee.

01:47:18.950--> 01:47:21.182
So, how can I reward
you with anything?

01:47:22.049--> 01:47:25.583
Never mind,
it's a happy occasion today.

01:47:26.038--> 01:47:28.858
That is why you take something.

01:47:31.938--> 01:47:33.018
May I tell you something?

01:47:33.139--> 01:47:35.299
Yes, you may. - Your name
shouldn't have been a doctor.

01:47:35.341--> 01:47:36.541
You should have been a lawyer.
