WEBVTT

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.750
(Chanting a mantra)

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.666
You have trouble brewing Ramanath!
Something needs to be done!

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.833
Come on now! Pray!

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.750
Take his blessings!

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:58.458
Hard to find someone like Ramendra Singha!
Rich and religious!

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.666
Have you seen the
"Raktamukhi Neela" in his collection?

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:07.166
Where? Show me!
Here!

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.750
Exhibition of Jewels by Ramendra Singha.

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.833
What is this "Neela"? A diamond?

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:32.958
Blue diamond!

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.375
Unlike other diamonds, its price
is not measured by its weight!

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:45.208
It is evaluated, at least in
India, by its divine power.

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:52.583
Specially the "Raktamukhi Neela".
It has special powers!

00:01:56.458 --> 00:02:04.083
So tell me... If I have that
"Neela" with me, will my miseries end?

00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:07.333
You want to have a ring?
Yes!

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:09.541
Are you even aware of its price?

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:17.291
One of my clients was a
clerk in the East India Company.

00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:19.541
Even he was in trouble.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.125
I told him about this Neela.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.958
Somehow he got money to get
one Neela. And he became rich!

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.250
All good?
Yes, come! Wait!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.875
We'll go after 11:47 pm. That will
be a good time. Not now.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:27.833
The ring was not fitting him properly.
Hence the master is not wearing it now.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.166
It's there, right?
Yes. But be very careful!

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.166
Let's go! Okay!

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:35.541
Nirmalbabu, I am surprised
by the inefficiency of the police!

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.832
I will now be forced to report
to the Police Commissioner!

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:44.458
I request you to have faith
in me, Your Majesty!

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:48.416
I understand that you have
incurred a loss of about 30,000 rupees!

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.166
King Mahendra Singha doesn't
care about a loss of 30,000 rupees!

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:58.333
I'm tired of explaining this to you!

00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:08.708
I don't care if the criminal gets caught
or not. I just want my "Raktamukhi Neela".

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:14.583
I totally get you, Your Majesty!

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:18.916
But please understand that I have
laid my hands on this case just recently.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:20.708
Please give me a few days.

00:08:23.916 --> 00:08:25.125
See Nirmalbabu...

00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:37.291
I will reward the person with 2,000
rupees, who can get me back my Neela!

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.416
Please stop! Please!

00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:56.625
Please don't hit me like that!
I will tell you who stole it! Yes!

00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:40.750
Where have you kept the
Raktamukhi Neela? Tell me!

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.083
Find it yourself!

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:49.541
I'm asking because I can't
find it! Speak up now!

00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:51.541
I don't know!

00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:35.875
You know Satya, soon this
radio will be every household matter!

00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:39.207
Can I hear songs, plays
and news on this radio?

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:44.208
Yes. Now you can spend time listening
to this when I am away with Ajit.

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:47.416
What happened?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:54.541
Let's go for a show of "Grihodaho" on Monday!
Prathamesh Barua's film. Songs by Raichand Baral.

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.666
Wait!...Next Monday...

00:11:58.708 --> 00:12:00.041
Not possible Satya.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:05.708
Have a meeting with the Police Commissioner.
They need me for some complicated case.

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.375
Let's go!
What do you mean?

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:12.083
So you will spend the next
Monday with the police?

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:15.166
Yes... Why?

00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:17.750
Monday is a working day.
What else will I do?

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:22.625
And I will be late that day. I also might
not come back at all. It's a long meeting.

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:27.791
So you will ever spend
the night with the police?

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:30.833
Why are you surprised?
You know my job!

00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:34.250
But does it have to be
the next Monday?

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:42.375
But what is so special about
the next Monday? Listen Satya!

00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:54.041
What's this?

00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.458
I asked you something!

00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.636
I have a problem sleeping
with the lights on!

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.625
The list of problems seem
to increase every day!

00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:10.541
It can. Humans change. And
you know that very well!

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.333
Isn't it?

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:16.500
I don't want to talk about
this Satya!... But... I don't!

00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:18.041
Fine!

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:51.333
Hey Ajit!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.500
Ajit?

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:57.708
Open the door!

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.500
Open the door!

00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:08.416
What happened? You?

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:14.583
Hey!

00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:17.125
What happened? At this hour?

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.625
So you'll sleep here?

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:27.666
What will your wife say?

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:30.500
Keep quiet! Let me sleep!

00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:32.625
What the hell!

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.750
Sister-in-law?

00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:46.291
Sister-in-law?

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.750
If you want tea at this
hour, ask your friend!

00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.041
Don't irritate me!

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:54.373
Thank God I'm not married!

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:33.500
Thank God I'm not married!

00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:48.541
What happened Ajit?
Didn't sleep well last night?

00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:50.458
Sleep?

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:51.833
A good one indeed!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.250
Haven't slept like this
for long Byomkesh!

00:16:04.583 --> 00:16:08.708
Bymokesh... He's Ramanath Neogi right?

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:10.823
The one you were talking about?

00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:14.708
The All India Radio finally found
time to broadcast a ten days old news!

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:17.750
This is unfair Byomkesh!

00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:26.916
News like this is apt for a cold day
like today! Just enjoy the mystery!

00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:32.041
Putiram! He has given
us only cold ones!

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:36.658
Give us some chillies as well!

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.458
This Ramanath Neogi is
no ordinary criminal!

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:46.875
He's really sharp!

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:49.833
And very intelligent!

00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:54.791
And also very courageous!

00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:00.125
Hard to find such
people these days!

00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:04.041
Such a national tragedy! Huh!

00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:12.666
But why is his parole news
being broadcast on radio?

00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:18.125
Because Ramanath was caught
and sentenced publicly!

00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:20.125
It's been long!

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.541
Ten years!

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.833
But I remember the
incidents clearly!

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.791
I just started working then!
Long before I met you!

00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:34.311
Then the best detective of
the Police department was Nirmalbabu.

00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:36.291
I heard everything from him.

00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:42.625
Jewels started to go missing
from different houses of Kolkata.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.750
The Raktamukhi Neela got stolen
from Ramendra Singha's house then.

00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:51.666
Do you believe one can change
his luck by wearing such Neela?

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:55.708
I do!

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
You-?...He's right you know! He's started to
believe in a lot of hocus pocus after marriage!

00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:12.166
Tell her I'm not at all
a conservative Hindu!

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:16.041
But I do believe in the powers
of Raktamukhi Neela!

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.708
But the results can vary
from people to people!

00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:25.500
It can even cause harm
to many people!

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:31.916
I've seen someone pay even 11000
rupees for a small gem like this!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.000
He ran into a lot of debts
during the Wartime... Wait!

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:40.583
But tell me, was Maharaja
Ramendra Singha's Neela found?

00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:43.083
No!

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.333
No one came to know where he had
put it away during his imprisonment!

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:53.250
The Police kept the search
on to get the reward of 2000 Rupees!

00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:29.208
Sir, the Neela is with Ramanath.
I saw it. Search him properly.

00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.958
Where's the Neela?

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.541
If you speak up, I'll
reduce your sentence.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.583
It was difficult!

00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:22.166
A prisoner has hidden a small
jewel like this somewhere!

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:28.750
I wish I got an opportunity
to solve the case!

00:20:30.416 --> 00:20:32.056
There was also this
reward of 2000 rupees!

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.041
You guys carry on!
I will go to my brother's house!

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.750
Hey- Leave it!

00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:54.041
And old man... Expensive new
shoes... Still working fine.

00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:58.416
Probably travels in cars.
A wealthy man!

00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:03.708
Staggers a little!..Ajit!...Is
this possible?

00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:05.708
How strange!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Peep and see!

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:14.791
It's Maharaja Ramendra Singha hismelf!
We were talking about him only!

00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:16.701
Can you guess why he has come?

00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:26.791
Hello!

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.916
I'm Bymokesh Bakshi.

00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:34.916
Oh! So you guessed
I'll be coming to you!

00:21:35.208 --> 00:21:37.291
I'm humbled.

00:21:37.916 --> 00:21:38.916
But...

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:51.916
But when the Police couldn't solve your
secretary's death within five days, I thought...

00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:53.666
Yes.

00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:55.083
You're right.

00:21:56.916 --> 00:22:03.583
I was very fond of my
secretary Haripada Das

00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:09.416
And his death was so horrible...!

00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:13.333
I mean...

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:16.458
Haripada was also not a good man.

00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:18.208
But...

00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:24.750
You know I like to
change people like them.

00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:30.291
I beg your pardon...
Haripada was not a good man?

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.583
Did he commit any crime?

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.333
He was... what you guys call...
"a dangerous criminal"!

00:22:38.666 --> 00:22:40.541
He was in prison
quite a few times.

00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:45.250
When he finally came to me
after serving his last sentence...

00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:53.291
Your Majesty!... If you can start from the
beginning once, it would be really helpful!

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.166
Sure... So it dates back six months.

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:01.416
Goodness!

00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:05.750
You have been in
prison four times already?

00:23:10.083 --> 00:23:11.875
So when did you get a release?

00:23:13.416 --> 00:23:16.166
Yesterday... Your Majesty!

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.541
May I know what
crimes you committed?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Theft... Forgery....Fraud

00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:34.958
Wow!

00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:39.666
Hence the sentence
was long enough!

00:23:41.416 --> 00:23:42.833
I get it Haripadababu.

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:48.791
But how can I appoint
someone like you?

00:23:52.208 --> 00:24:00.208
Your Majesty... Had I not mentioned my crimes, you would not even come to know!

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.500
True that.

00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:07.958
I just need another chance...

00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:16.208
So what all can you do?

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:22.500
I'm not educated enough.

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:29.166
I have been in prison
when I was 19 years old.

00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:36.541
I just learned typing shorthand
out of my own interest.

00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:43.125
Your Majesty... If you
just trust me once...

00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.083
I'll take care of you forever.

00:24:49.416 --> 00:24:54.666
Don't know why... But I liked
him from the beginning.

00:24:56.541 --> 00:25:01.375
And... I can't disrespect
them for some reason.

00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:08.875
And that's why I hired him as
a typist even though I didn't need one.

00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:17.791
And I noticed that he is not
only efficient, but also very intelligent.

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:27.583
He used to perform the work,
which was not his own, also very nicely.

00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:39.499
Abinashbabu, the Indian State Broadcasting
Agency has been renamed to All India Radio.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.375
Their new office will
be in 1,Gustin Place.

00:25:43.958 --> 00:25:51.958
They invited me over. But I have an
appointment with Commissioner Tagore.

00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:58.416
Are you ready with the papers
of the Kamarhati factory?... On it!

00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:02.708
You're doing it now?
Goodness!

00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:08.250
Will he wait for me all day? I
can't talk to him without those papers!

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.750
I've put the papers in this file..
What papers?... The one you're looking for!

00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:21.083
Oh yes!

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:31.166
Thank you Haripada!
You're now an asset to me!

00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:39.083
Just around this time,
my secretary Abinashbabu passed away.

00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:45.666
After that, I appointed
Haripada as my secretary.

00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:51.833
My own men were
unhappy with this.

00:26:52.041 --> 00:27:00.041
I didn't care because
I knew I was right.

00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.666
Sit down.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
What is it?

00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:17.916
Need your signature.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.458
Here!

00:27:29.083 --> 00:27:30.083
Here you go!

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:36.375
Yes, tell me?... How can you trust Haripada
so much that you signed just like that?

00:27:37.958 --> 00:27:44.500
It's okay. I think he has changed
to a good human being.

00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:48.208
But still...
I know!

00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:55.791
But you know, I think poverty
pushed him to commit crimes.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:04.458
But now he is not poor. Hence the change.
You can find many like him in prison.

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:10.250
So, tell me now... Yes, this is
the accounts for this month.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.666
Haripada has been performing all his
duties very well for the last few months.

00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:24.208
But then what happened last Tuesday...!!!

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.291
Shocked me like anything!

00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:34.583
It chills me even to think about how
brutally his throat has been slit!

00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:42.458
All his vocal cords has been
ripped apart savagely.

00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:46.375
Where there any other
marks on his body?

00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:53.291
Yes, there was. There was a stab wound
on his chest. And that caused his death.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:59.416
The blows on the throat came later...
So first he was killed by the stab wound?

00:29:01.875 --> 00:29:04.833
And then someone
ripped apart his throat!

00:29:06.708 --> 00:29:08.958
That's right! Horrible!

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:18.916
How can a human being be
so brutal? So inhuman?

00:29:22.666 --> 00:29:30.000
Look Byomkesh babu, I want you to investigate,
irrespective of what the Police is doing.

00:29:30.875 --> 00:29:36.708
The criminal should be
punished. For society.

00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:39.791
Do you mind?

00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:45.958
No, it's fine. As a matter of fact,
I get along well with the police.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:52.541
Do you remember how long was
Haripada imprisoned for the last time?

00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:58.791
I heard it was for 14 years.

00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:05.416
But being a good prisoner,
it was reduced to 11 years.

00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:13.750
Your Majesty... Did you notice
anything peculiar about him?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.458
Umm..Peculiar?

00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:22.833
You may leave
now. I'll see.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Your Majesty, I'll do any work.
If I don't get shelter here...

00:30:49.041 --> 00:30:54.083
Anything else? I mean
any other incident?

00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:56.916
Anything else?

00:30:59.375 --> 00:31:01.958
Not really... Oh yes!

00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:10.875
It's nothing extraordinary.
But I think you should know.

00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:13.666
See if you pick up anything.

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:21.000
A precious jewel was stolen from my house-
Raktamukhi Neela!

00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:23.583
So you know?

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:30.500
So you might also know that I
had announced a reward of 2000 rupees?

00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:34.541
I know. But is it still open?

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:42.625
It's strange. Because Haripada asked
me this same thing the other day.

00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:47.791
Your Majesty?

00:31:50.125 --> 00:31:51.125
Want to say something?

00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:58.666
Can I ask you something
if you don't mind?

00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:01.958
Yes?

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:19.708
Yes, tell me?

00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:29.583
Will, you still give 2000 rupees as a
reward today if you find your jewel?

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:46.458
How can I expect to find something
which even the police couldn't find?

00:32:48.083 --> 00:32:56.083
You never know. Tell me if you will give the
money if someone shows up with the jewel?

00:32:58.166 --> 00:33:04.375
I will... But why are you
suddenly asking this?

00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:14.291
The thing is I am a poor man. If you assure
to give the money, I can try to find it.

00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:21.333
Okay. See what you can do.

00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:24.541
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:34.458
What if I ask you the
same question today?

00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.750
Yes. But...

00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:39.875
Want to know who killed Haripada?

00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:44.250
I don't get you.

00:33:45.583 --> 00:33:47.666
You know who killed Haripada?

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.500
Yes. I do.

00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:54.225
But I don't want to gather any
proof against him. It's not my job.

00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:56.403
Let the police take care of that.

00:33:57.791 --> 00:34:04.125
This is magical. You really
know who killed Haripada?

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.916
Yes. It's just a guess as of now.
But I am sure I won't be wrong.

00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:16.000
Who is he?... Your Majesty, you should be going
now. It's late. I will call you in the evening.

00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:21.083
And yes! You might also
get back your "Neela"!

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.083
How is your retired life?

00:35:25.583 --> 00:35:29.166
Nice. But as of now, this
is your responsibility.

00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:32.666
His Majesty showed up
at my doorsteps today.

00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:35.791
Such an old case. I
better buckle up now.

00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:42.708
Even I felt the need of a great detective
like Byomkesh at the time of the case.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.530
Why didn't you approach me then?

00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:51.125
You were quite young then!
Or is it because I was not famous?

00:36:00.416 --> 00:36:02.541
Many thanks Nirmalbabu!

00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:07.125
Can we have tea together?
Sure. Come along.

00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:53.041
Poilce Commissioner Tagore Sahib!
Cannot do much without me!

00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:56.500
Want to have a fry?

00:36:59.333 --> 00:37:00.333
I don't mind.

00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:02.458
Alright!

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:13.583
These fries are saviors! Can't concentrate
on my work without having them!

00:37:13.958 --> 00:37:15.707
Sure. A must need for a
talented person like you.

00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:18.308
Did you say something?
No, it's nothing. Let me come to the point.

00:37:19.166 --> 00:37:24.166
The murder of Haripada falls
under your jurisdiction, right?

00:37:24.791 --> 00:37:27.000
Why are you bothered?
Planning to interfere?

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:31.083
Can't help it Bidhubabu. My habit.
Who is in charge of this case?

00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.458
Who? I have no clue.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.790
Is it Purnababu?
Yes! Yes! But why?

00:37:39.791 --> 00:37:43.583
Nothing much. Just need to
arrest someone and search his place.

00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:52.833
Oh God! Again? You better enjoy the cold
outside. Have good food. And here you are!

00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:56.916
Okay. I'll do that.
Huh? What?

00:37:56.958 --> 00:38:00.875
I'll have good food as you said.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:07.833
Was just thinking to invite Tagore Sahib
on my way back home. Let's go Ajit... Yes!

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.666
Hey! I asked you guys to
call Purnababu so many times!

00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:47.166
Slowly!

00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:51.625
Search properly!

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.083
Yes, Bidhubabu? Tell me!

00:40:00.583 --> 00:40:01.943
What? You couldn't find the Neela?

00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:06.000
Fine! Keep an eye on him.
I'll be there with His Majesty.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.166
Ajit, call a cab!

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:55.833
Go fast!

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:44.041
Let me show you a picture!

00:41:44.875 --> 00:41:48.833
See if you can recognize this man!

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.958
Yes. He looks familiar.

00:41:56.958 --> 00:41:59.791
Wait!... He was the man who...

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:13.583
Ramanath, you are done for now.
Surrender yourself!

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Else no one can save you!

00:42:36.083 --> 00:42:37.208
Calm down Ramanath!

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.708
Ramanath, I beg of you... Calm down!

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:43.291
Don't get excited. Calm down.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.916
Be careful! He is armed!
Is it?

00:42:48.958 --> 00:42:50.375
Even I have arms for him.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.708
Ramanath, I'm Byomkesh Bakshi.
I'm just a simple truth seeker.

00:42:56.916 --> 00:42:59.166
Trust me, I'm not
here to harm you.

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:02.583
In fact, I'm here to save you.

00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:09.250
Don't try to come close. We're nothing
without each other's help, Ramanath.

00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:17.291
Anyway, I want to
tell you all a story.

00:43:18.375 --> 00:43:21.541
Not a fictional story like Ajit's.
It's a true story.

00:43:22.708 --> 00:43:27.583
Ramanath, I'll try to tell it with all the
facts correct. If I'm wrong, correct me.

00:43:27.791 --> 00:43:32.916
Great. Let me start. I'll tell the
incidents after you went to jail.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:40.125
Ramanath went to prison.
But didn't let go of the Raktamukhi Neela.

00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:49.416
He carried it with him. But how did he manage
to hide it? Will you tell that Ramanath?

00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:02.500
We'll talk about that later. But you stole a lot
of jewels. Why did you keep this one with you?

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.916
Did it have any special powers?

00:44:08.833 --> 00:44:16.375
A jewel-like that! So beautiful! Ah!

00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:21.791
But you had heard that the jewel
is lucky. Isn't it?

00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:30.416
We often tend to mistake
bad people for friends. Isn't it, Ajit?

00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:40.041
So Ramanath went to jail. And police
came to know that the Neela is with him.

00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:47.416
Tell me where the Neela is. Don't complain
later if your sentence gets increased!

00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:58.791
Haripada!
The second prisoner?

00:45:00.083 --> 00:45:08.083
Yes, your secretary! He committed crimes from
a very early age. He knew a lot of tricks.

00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:14.333
Ramanath came to know of this
one particular trick he knew.

00:45:15.958 --> 00:45:17.125
Isn't it, Ramanath?

00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:20.541
Will you speak up? Huh?

00:45:35.291 --> 00:45:43.291
Haripada, you're not allowed to carry money
inside the prison. How did you get it?

00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:59.583
Who said it's not allowed?
You want to see a trick?

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.333
See this!

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:20.458
How's that? Nobody can guess!

00:46:21.625 --> 00:46:26.000
Do you think only shirts have pockets?
Even our throats have pockets!

00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:36.291
How strange! Actually, those who are in prison for long, know this trick!

00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:46.541
I have been in prison since childhood. I know
this trick and made pockets inside my throat.

00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:53.833
Can you please do me a favour?
Yes, tell me?

00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:56.125
Wait!

00:47:01.916 --> 00:47:02.916
This!

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:11.250
The police are looking for this! This is my lucky
gem. Can you please hide it in your pocket?

00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:41.208
That's it! Gone!

00:47:42.625 --> 00:47:49.416
Please take it out again!
Not more than once!...Yes, sure!

00:47:58.291 --> 00:47:59.291
See this!

00:48:03.583 --> 00:48:06.166
Keep it inside now!

00:48:28.583 --> 00:48:31.500
Haripada got shifted to a
different prison the very next day!

00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.331
There is even record of that
in the prison register!

00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:36.583
Haripada got lucky!

00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:52.958
Haripada!

00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:06.375
Even I am feeling bad. We stayed
together for quite a while. Right?

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.041
Don't know if we'll ever meet again!

00:49:15.416 --> 00:49:21.666
Take care of yourself Ramanath.
Even I'm feeling sad.

00:49:27.208 --> 00:49:29.125
Haripada betrayed him!

00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:32.666
He didn't return the Neela
to Ramanath before he left.

00:49:33.458 --> 00:49:37.625
Nobody would listen to Ramanath.
Hence he kept quiet.

00:49:38.666 --> 00:49:43.833
And from then, he started to
hatch a revenge plan. Right, Ramanath?

00:49:46.875 --> 00:49:49.916
And ten years passed like this.

00:49:50.833 --> 00:49:56.125
Haripada got released from the
prison and then he came to you.

00:49:56.833 --> 00:50:02.875
He wanted to get close with you
and then look for an opportunity.

00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:07.083
An opportunity to return the
Raktamukhi Neela to you.

00:50:07.875 --> 00:50:11.625
But not for free of course.
He wanted the 2000 rupees reward.

00:50:12.541 --> 00:50:17.833
He knew he'll get caught if he tried to
sell it. Hence he didn't go that way.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.750
But you behaved so well with
him from the start, he felt guilty.

00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:40.916
He felt guilty to ask for
money from His Majesty.

00:50:45.916 --> 00:50:52.291
Thanks to His Majesty's kindness,
even Haripada felt guilty.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.400
What happened after that, Ramanarh?

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
You won't say?

00:50:59.125 --> 00:51:00.291
Fine. I'll say.

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:06.750
You were released from prison ten days
back. Did you know Haripada's whereabouts?

00:51:07.166 --> 00:51:09.666
No. I didn't.
You didn't, huh?

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.333
But just see the twist of fate!

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.375
Within four days, Ramanath got wind of
Haripada in His Majesty's house.

00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:36.625
Haripada got unwell
just by seeing Ramanath.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.958
He had no reason other
than that to get sick.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.791
The sense of revenge
hit you again after ten years!

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.125
And then that night...

00:52:35.708 --> 00:52:37.083
Ramanath, where's the Neela?

00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:45.624
I don't know. I don't even know
Haripada. I don't have the Neela.

00:52:45.625 --> 00:52:51.291
You're not getting it Ramanath. It's a
cursed stone. Hence you cannot get over it.

00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:58.333
Just see how you got caught after you stole
the Neela. You were a free man before that.

00:52:59.541 --> 00:53:05.875
And just look what happened to Haripada. See
what you did to his throat where he kept it!

00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:10.125
Return the Neela now.
It'll be good for you.

00:53:10.875 --> 00:53:11.875
Return it.

00:53:12.625 --> 00:53:14.916
It's not good. It's almost
like snake poison.

00:53:15.666 --> 00:53:21.250
You'll be a dead man anyway if
you keep it with you any longer.

00:53:21.583 --> 00:53:22.791
Give back the Neela, Ramanath.

00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:32.791
Ramanath!

00:53:33.666 --> 00:53:34.875
Ramanath, I'm warning you!

00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:51.708
Byomkesh! Move away!

00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:54.833
Watch out Byomkeshbabu!

00:54:06.958 --> 00:54:07.958
What the...

00:54:38.958 --> 00:54:44.875
Oh Goodness! There it is! Here you
go, Your Majesty! Raktamukhi Neela.

00:54:45.291 --> 00:54:46.291
Wow!

00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:49.999
I really don't know how to thank you!

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.583
I don't want such dangerous Neela!

00:54:55.125 --> 00:55:02.624
I don't want it! I want
freedom! I don't want it!

00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:03.625
Ramanath!

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.083
Follow me!

00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:24.958
But no Neela can
tame me, Ramanath!

00:56:34.666 --> 00:56:40.125
It's already 8! Don't blame me later
if you are late for the meeting!

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:44.041
Today's Monday?

00:56:46.666 --> 00:56:52.291
Umm... Err... I don't think
I'll go to the meeting today!

00:56:52.625 --> 00:56:55.166
Fine. I'm going to my
brother's house anyway.

00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:58.416
Sort out with Putiram
when you feel hungry.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:15.166
I love you too much to let you go!

00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:30.083
Happy Anniversary, Satya!

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.500
You remembered?

00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:37.750
Of course! Why won't I?

00:57:45.541 --> 00:57:47.290
Happy Anniversary you two!

00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:50.375
Many thanks! If you want tea,
ask Putiram. Satya's busy now!

00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:52.208
But are you busy as well?

00:57:52.958 --> 00:57:56.041
God!... Yes, I'm! Busy in search
of the truth. It'll take time.

00:57:56.333 --> 00:57:57.333
Go for it!
