00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.101
What do you mean by "came to drop...?"

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.765
Satyakam himself owned a car, brother...!

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.250
Yes of course..!

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:11.041
A red one...!

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:12.083
Then..??

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.885
But yesterday he came
in a different car...!

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.208
Around what time?

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:17.083
Uhh...

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.809
I didn't excatly notice brother Byomkesh...

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.083
But I guess before midnight....!

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:23.125
I was....

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:25.916
behind the trees in front
of Choudhury Villa...

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.916
I stood there, to catch that fellow!

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.059
Infested with mosquitoes...
it was hell, brother...!

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.125
Suddenly....I saw...

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:47.500
Listen Annapurna!

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.500
Don't you dare disturb me anymore!

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.083
Now go!!

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.375
Oh shit..!

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.790
And then you ran away, ,,?

00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:05.791
Why..??

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:06.916
What else!

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.708
The car didn't move from there...

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:11.666
I felt I won't get the chance to...

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.125
catch him in seclusion.

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:14.750
By the way....Nanda....

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.598
You must have noticed the car's number..!

00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:17.500
No!

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.291
It was so dark...

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.309
and moreover the car
was too far from me..!

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.333
No no Ajit... Ajit....! One
minute....one minute..!

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:25.375
Nanda...!

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.386
What was the woman's name you just said...?

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:28.958
..uhh...

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.832
God..! By what name was
Satyakam calling her...?!

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:31.833
..uhmm...

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:33.875
Listen Annapurna...!

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.291
Don't you dare disturb me anymore...!

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:38.541
Oh yes...!

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:39.916
Some Annapurna...!

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:41.528
Then he cursed her in English...!

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.375
Annapurna....??

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:00.791
Anna....purna.....

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.833
"She's one of the designated
desires of Satyakam Das...!"

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.333
"Madam Annapurna..!"

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.625
..hmm....!

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.184
And then you know brother Byomkesh...!

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:10.375
Hmm..?

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.021
I had just crossed the
lane by then...

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:13.559
I heard a deafening noise..!!

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:14.583
Sound of firing.

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:16.125
Yes... even I felt so...!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.375
I got scared and ...ran away...!

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.831
Just day before yesterday,

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.833
Doctor Sailen was arrested,

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.250
..by the Lalbazar area Police.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.166
Hence didn't have the guts....!

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:28.333
Ajit....!

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.976
C'mon, feeling hungry, let's go home..!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.680
Satya must be waiting for us with food...

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:34.541
Nanda....!

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.708
If only you stayed back
yesterday to punch Satyakam...!

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.458
Maybe he would have been alive...
maybe.....

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.958
Anyway... leave it....!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
C'mon...!

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:47.500
C'mon...!

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.101
You're not allowed to leave this
locality for a while now...!

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.125
huhh..??

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:53.833
Keep it in mind Nanda...!

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:29.000
You...!!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
- Hello....

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:32.875
My name is Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.916
But not detective, I'm a truth-seeker.

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:42.583
Anyway, I need to talk to you...

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:46.625
But how come you knew...

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:48.125
- Since day before yesterday...

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.333
On Saturday night.

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.458
In this car of yours....Satyakam Das....

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.583
stopped in front his
house Choudhury Villa...

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.878
Needless to say, you were
also inside the car...

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.999
You cannot deny it, unfortunately....

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.666
there's a witness to this incident.

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:04.458
I was...

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:06.958
So....?

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:08.833
As of now, nothing important...

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.250
Now what you will tell me....

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.665
is about that night...

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.333
the night, when Satyakam was murdered,

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.791
what were you doing over there.....

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:20.750
..and what conversation
did you have with him...?

00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:22.958
If I say, that's a personal talk....?

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:24.625
I can't tell you...?

00:05:24.626 --> 00:05:26.291
- Yes you can say that.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:28.333
You can say that.....

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.458
But remember....this is a murder case....!

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.125
You are the last person to
see Satyakam alive....!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.665
And let me tell you another thing...
do you know,

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:41.041
Satyakam had come to my
place three days back?

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:44.333
He himself said to me, that someone wants
to murder him,

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.416
and I solve his murder mystery....!

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:53.999
Hence, till this murder mystery
doesn't get solved......

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.708
I won't keep calm, Madam Annapurna...!

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:00.958
Rest is your choice...!

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:08.958
This isn't London Satyakam...!

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:13.666
In our country, this matter
may appear petty to a man...

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:18.083
but for a woman, it's a a major issue.

00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:22.166
But above all, I love you.....!

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.416
About us....

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.250
Listen. listen....! Just listen...

00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:28.583
Without the father's name....

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.880
a child's identity is
nothing, alright....??

00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:34.082
I have a friend who's a doctor.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:35.750
We'll go there... and....

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:38.208
no one will know...!

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:40.166
What are you saying...!!

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:43.000
What exactly are you saying....!!

00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:44.416
Why...????

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:47.125
Do you even know what you are saying...??

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.208
I won't....

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.500
marry you.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.250
Is that clear...??

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.583
Do whatever you want....

00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.083
Okay...?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I won't....

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:06.583
won't leave you so easily....!

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:09.000
Don't try to give me arrest-threats....!

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:11.708
I am beyond the reach for such threats....!

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:15.916
Now go...

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:18.125
Go... go now...!

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:19.375
go...

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:20.666
Go...!

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.625
You are still here...?

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:29.875
Huh...?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.041
Listen Annapurna...!

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.458
Don't you dare disturb me anymore...!

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.499
If I really wanted to murder Satyakam,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.740
I would have done that already.

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.116
I even had the opportunity...!

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.083
Satyakam refused to take the
child's responsibility.

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:55.416
But don't you have any....

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:56.708
..anger...

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.250
or rage against him..?

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:00.416
Rage...??

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:02.666
Yes I had..!

00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:05.958
He's dead now....!

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.250
Still angry...??

00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:12.041
It doesn't matter to me any
longer Mr. Byomkesh...!

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:13.833
Was this ring...

00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:16.625
..gifted to you by Satyakam Das?

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:24.208
Believe me....

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.735
Sister-in-law... I need some tea..!

00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:34.434
Just returned from the police station.

00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:36.166
Satyakam's post mortem is complete....

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:39.184
Mr. Ushapati and the rest of the family
are now going for his cremation.

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:40.208
And Mr. Bhabani...

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.708
..is totally indifferent
about finding the murderer.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.642
The death ocurred between
midnight and 2 o'clock...

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:49.791
and the bore diameter
of the bullet is 0.45...

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:51.625
I got it sketched...!

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:55.138
The bullet entered from under the scapula,

00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:56.166
..the left scapula...

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:57.415
..pierced the heart,

00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:58.624
..and is stuck on the
third rib of the cage.

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.165
The bullet entered in an upward manner,

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:01.624
..and more towards the
centre from the side.

00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:02.892
And there are no other injuries...

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:04.767
Traces of alcohol have
been found in his stomach,

00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:06.833
Which is aboslutely normal to me...!

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:08.083
Sister-in-law...!

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:09.000
Some tea please...!

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:10.625
Yes..! Here I am..!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.583
Here you go...

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.250
Give him first, he needs it more...!

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:15.875
Thank you...!

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:17.708
Take it.

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.833
The bullet has entered
in an upward manner...

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.930
From the side... more towards the center...

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.041
That means....the shooter...

00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:49.333
targeted from the left side of the road,
from inside the bushes.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.500
I have a question.

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:03.708
What..?

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:05.791
Why did the shooter squat and fire?

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.416
"Why did the shooter... squat and fire...."

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:11.250
I can't tell it brother...

00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.291
The person didn't consult with me...!

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:15.416
No no... think about it Ajit...!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.958
Thoughts that you all have...

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.124
Not ours, what the post
mortem report says...

00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:21.601
- Yes, whatever 'post mortem report'...

00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:22.790
Rather the police feels,

00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:24.457
..that the murderer was hiding inside...

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:25.916
behind the gate...!

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:34.000
What if, the bullet wasn't fired from
inside the bushes..?

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.583
From outside the gate...

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:38.625
..if someone,

00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:40.415
from inside the car...

00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:41.892
From where on earth did the car come...!

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:43.249
Annapurna..

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.833
Ohh yes... right..!!

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Alright....!

00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:49.208
That means....

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:51.582
if someone shoots
sitting inside the car,

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:53.791
..the bullet might enter
in an upward manner..!

00:10:56.708 --> 00:11:00.083
She wears the ring gifted
to her by Satyakam...

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.000
moreover, she is carrying
his child in her womb.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.166
God... I'm getting confused Ajit...!

00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:09.791
And to top it...

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.208
..after meeting Annapurna,

00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:14.541
getting startled isn't abnormal...

00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:16.000
Ohh, stop it!

00:11:29.291 --> 00:11:29.875
By the way Byomk..

00:11:29.916 --> 00:11:30.916
- Silence...!

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:41.416
Satyakam opened the gate, and
walked till the main door...

00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:43.750
..he walked till upto that much...

00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:46.916
Then the shooter murdered him...!

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:49.958
Why...??

00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:51.833
Here... here...! Ajit! Ajit....!

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:53.500
Why wasn't he shot here only..???

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.083
Would have shot and run away
so easily from here itself...!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Then...?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Come!

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:02.892
Where is the bullet inside his body?

00:12:02.916 --> 00:12:03.708
Where is the bullet inside his body!

00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:04.083
To the left..!

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:04.458
Left..!

00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:05.916
Here..!

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.416
But my point is...

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:09.625
..what if, he wasn't shot
from inside the bushes,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.500
Come come...!

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.040
There's more to ponder about. And about...

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.761
that foilpaper disc stuck on the door..!

00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:25.708
Who glued it there, when, and why...??

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.363
You see my dear Satyakam....!

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.290
That thing over there,

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:36.051
is the doorway to
your murder mystery...!

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:49.125
Every..everything is getting
so complicated Byomkesh...!

00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:50.568
Let me complicate it even more...!

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:51.625
One doesn't need to...

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.833
carry a torch, while walking down the
streets of Kolkata...

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.708
Why did Satyakam need an electric torch??

00:12:57.916 --> 00:12:59.082
He might have needed it,

00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:01.563
while walking the stretch,
from the gateway to the main door...

00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:02.791
What...??

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:07.708
while walking the stretch,
from the gateway to the main door...

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.833
Think Ajit... think.....think over it...

00:14:39.583 --> 00:14:41.040
Can I get some tea, sister-in-law...?

00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:42.041
Yes....

00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:43.458
Ajit...!

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:46.625
Is Satyakam's cremation complete...?

00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:47.958
Yes...!

00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:48.458
Which means,

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:50.740
the family members had
stepped out of their house....!

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:53.874
Had the police searched yesterday,

00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:55.332
they would have got hold of the revolver

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:56.333
inside the house only.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.041
We won't get it today.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:00.166
That means,

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:01.583
..murderer is in the family...??!!

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:06.166
Have to speak to Sitangshu in private....

00:15:07.416 --> 00:15:08.791
Satya, please bring me some tea..!

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:10.166
Surely....

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.351
Yesterday, I heard in the
local police station,

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:21.815
..that you had killed the OC of
Rath Tala police station...??

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:26.333
See... like you loved your father,

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.333
similarly, you love your own sister...?

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:30.958
Isn't it so...??

00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:33.958
Let me ask you a straightforward
question, Sitangshu..!

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:35.290
I would appreciate,

00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:37.708
if you are equally
straighforward in answering.....!

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:42.333
Ever wanted to murder Satyakam.....?

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.958
Ever..? At any point of time...?

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:10.875
Y... you want to say
something brother Satya...?

00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:14.125
Just looking...

00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.207
Consult a doctor,

00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:33.267
if you are always in the
mood for some filthy fun!

00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.651
I see you eyeing her once more...

00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:37.673
I'll chop off your
masculinity in a second...!

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:40.875
Get lost!

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:44.458
Go away!

00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:51.083
How many times have I told you.....

00:16:51.084 --> 00:16:53.041
..to close the door from
inside when sleeping!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Close it now!

00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:58.791
Regarding Satyakam,

00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:01.583
your uncle and aunty must
have had a lot of quarrels...?

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:02.583
Quarrels...??

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:03.416
Yes, quarrels.

00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:06.333
I mean... verbal fights,
arguments, disagreements....

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:11.250
Uncle and aunty don't
talk to each other.....

00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:17.749
Since when....?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.208
Since I am seeing both of them.

00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.458
And... how is your aunty
as a person, by the way?

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.660
Is she quarrelsome in nature?

00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:25.791
Not at all...!

00:17:26.916 --> 00:17:28.396
She's an amazing person by nature...!

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:44.291
Byomkesh Bakshi speaking...

00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.000
Hello, I'm Ushapati speaking....

00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:48.833
Yes Mr. Ushapati... tell me....

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.875
Probably you have heard... that,

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:53.541
today early morning....

00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:57.125
Satyakam's cremation took place.

00:17:57.791 --> 00:17:59.083
I went to...

00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:01.108
the police station a while back.

00:18:02.458 --> 00:18:03.458
They couldn't...

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.958
..provide me with any news...

00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:09.040
That's why I called you to ask you...

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:11.374
how is your investigation proceeding..?

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:13.125
If only you can let me know...

00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:15.750
It'll take some time Mr. Ushapati.

00:18:16.875 --> 00:18:18.458
How is your wife now?

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.916
Same as before...

00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:23.166
The concern is mainly reagarding her....!

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.225
She's completely shattered right now...!

00:18:26.916 --> 00:18:27.916
I was thinking...

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:32.790
of taking her to somewhere...
for a few days.

00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:33.791
Away from all this.

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:36.416
Maybe that might be good for her.

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:37.458
Hmm... yes..!

00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:40.291
By the way, have you decided where...?

00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:42.291
No no... not yet...

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:44.291
but...

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500
..anywhere outside Kolkata.

00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:49.375
By the way... Mr. Byomkesh,

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:51.416
The police will allow us to go, right..?

00:18:51.708 --> 00:18:54.548
If you inform the police before leaving,
I don't think they will object.

00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:57.291
Better...

00:18:58.541 --> 00:18:59.750
I'll do accordingly.

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:01.790
You know Mr. Byomkesh,

00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:04.083
Kolkata seems like hell now...!

00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:05.583
So...

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.166
That's it for now...

00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:08.621
By the way Mr. Ushapati...!

00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:10.541
Yes...?

00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:13.791
Will the shop stay closed, since
you will be outstation...?

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:15.125
No no.....

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.041
That is not possible....

00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:21.500
Our cashier...

00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:22.708
Mr. Dhananjay...?

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:24.375
He'll be in charge.

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:32.000
and I'll also tell Sitangshu to take
the responsibility.... from now onwards.

00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:33.833
I am all alone.

00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.541
By the way... will you,

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.365
go to the shop right now...?

00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.041
No Mr. Byomkesh, not today....

00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:42.083
I don't feel like.

00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:43.541
Ok fine. Bye.

00:19:43.708 --> 00:19:45.000
Yes... bye...

00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:51.791
Mr. Dhananjay!

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500
Hello...!

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:56.500
I came for a different purpose today....

00:19:57.125 --> 00:19:59.249
Few of your old colleagues were saying...

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.958
and even I also felt, that...

00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:05.083
Your writing is not just
limited to calculations..!

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.541
There's a....

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:11.625
talent hidden, somewhere
inside you... isn't it?

00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.374
Now if only I could get
to witness your talent...

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:16.333
One minute....one minute...!

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:17.333
You have something....??

00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:21.333
Here it is...!!

00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:35.500
"Reciting a wedding
invitation in poetry form"

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:39.333
"With best wishes,

00:20:39.334 --> 00:20:42.375
Dhananjay Mondal and the
'Suchitra Emporium' family."

00:20:42.916 --> 00:20:45.541
What did you see in these
gibberish lines, brother?

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.124
Focus on its information...

00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:49.285
and not on the literary
aspect of it Mr. Author...!

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:51.625
Information? Here..?

00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:54.041
"Union of souls..."

00:20:55.291 --> 00:20:56.666
"The wedding bells ringing...."

00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:59.249
"By clasping Madam Suchitra's
hand into his hand..."

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.708
"Mr. Usha became pati (husband)"

00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:04.499
Dear Mr. No-Observant...!

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.060
read the whole thing thoroughly....!

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:08.541
See brother..!

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.250
This marriage of Madam
Suchitra and Mr. Ushapati,

00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:14.708
pulled out the inner
poet of Mr. Dhananjay...!

00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:16.309
I can't observe anything more than that...!

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:18.013
Notice their marriage date for God's sake!

00:21:19.416 --> 00:21:23.791
13th February, 1915.

00:21:26.208 --> 00:21:28.500
Still in darkness.....

00:21:29.541 --> 00:21:30.541
Can't imagine...!

00:21:33.666 --> 00:21:34.666
What happened?

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.832
When I had asked Satyakam about his age,

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:50.434
he had mentioned his
date of birth, remember?

00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:52.708
Yes that I remember, but uhhh....

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:53.541
don't remember the date....

00:21:53.625 --> 00:21:55.665
That's why you are an author,
and I'm a truth-seeker...!

00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:56.708
I remember it!

00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:02.166
Yes, you are a genius! You
remember the dates... years...

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:03.291
Wait...!

00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:05.540
How are these dates connected
to Satyakam's murder...??

00:22:05.541 --> 00:22:07.625
Very deeply connected..use
your grey matter...!

00:22:10.875 --> 00:22:11.333
See...!

00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:14.708
My grey matter is in grave danger
after reading that poem...!

00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:17.375
Tell me clearly, who is the murderer?

00:22:20.791 --> 00:22:22.711
You still can't guess who
is the murderer...??!!

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:23.916
No....!

00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:25.125
I can't...!

00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:26.500
Who is it...?!

00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:38.666
What's for lunch Satya....?

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:41.875
What...!!

00:22:43.083 --> 00:22:44.726
Feed him nothing but
bittergourd sister-in-law....

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.333
..he is undoubtedly degrading....!

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:02.833
Now tell....

00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:04.166
Who is the murderer...?

00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:07.166
What happened...! Tell!

00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:18.791
Did you see....!

00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:33.208
Brother-in-law...!

00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:34.208
Yes....?

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.040
What about those tickets...?

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:38.041
Tickets!

00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:39.666
Wait...!

00:23:39.916 --> 00:23:41.625
First let this matter get solved....

00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:46.458
It's at the verge of conclusion....

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:48.166
Read his face...!

00:23:52.708 --> 00:23:53.708
Is it so...?

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:56.333
Byomkesh....!

00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:00.541
Byomkesh...!!

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.541
When will be the curtain call... brother??

00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:06.333
Getting imapatient...!

00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.125
Patience....patience....!

00:24:10.166 --> 00:24:11.166
Here we go again...!

00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:15.125
Just a little bit...!

00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:18.041
Almost...!!

00:24:22.291 --> 00:24:23.458
Wait Ajit... wait...!

00:24:29.791 --> 00:24:30.208
Satya...!

00:24:30.208 --> 00:24:30.750
Yes...?

00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:31.791
Hold this for a moment...

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.750
Yes, tell me...!

00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:40.375
Yes, I was waiting for your call only....!

00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:43.541
Sure sure...!....Coming...!

00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:46.416
Fine I'll go alone...!

00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:47.625
Okay...

00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:49.333
right....!

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:54.875
Ajit...!

00:24:54.916 --> 00:24:55.916
Say...!

00:24:56.708 --> 00:24:59.208
Go to Howrah Station and check the status
of the tickets....!

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.650
I'm going out for a while Satya...!

00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:47.541
There you are....!

00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:49.666
See I've come alone...!

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.208
By the way, I have
something to show you...!

00:25:55.708 --> 00:25:56.750
I'll keep it here.....

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.125
It glitters....!

00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:07.125
It's plain foil paper...!

00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.316
It was glued on the main door.....!

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.310
And no one in the family knows why.....

00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:13.916
Even you don't... I guess?

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.000
I have one request Mr. Ushapati...!

00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.625
Once this case gets solved...

00:26:21.208 --> 00:26:23.250
..and I believe it'll be in a short while,

00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:26.750
I want to take this thing with me.

00:26:31.458 --> 00:26:33.083
I have something more to give you...!

00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:00.916
You... got this....

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.850
You must be knowing the handwriting...??

00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:06.708
The only poetic creation of
Mr. Dhananjay in his life....!

00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:10.083
He had preserved it in a way...

00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:11.750
you can't even imagine...!

00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.125
Yes... but....

00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.416
Why to me....

00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:20.250
It's your wedding invitation
written as poetry...!

00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:23.416
Though my curiosity lies in the....

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:24.934
dates written there....!

00:27:24.958 --> 00:27:25.958
Check it...!

00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:33.541
You got married to Madam
Suchitra on 13th February 1915.

00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:37.000
And Satyakam was born.....

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.250
7th July, 1915....??

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.750
Your child was born before you could complete
five months of your married life....!

00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:55.098
Now, will you speak out the truth...??

00:27:59.583 --> 00:28:00.291
Mr. Ushapati...??

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:01.333
huhh...?

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.291
I was....

00:28:16.041 --> 00:28:22.500
..just a shop-assistant of 'Suchitra
Emporium' at that time....

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:51.458
You are staying with your sister's in laws,

00:28:51.833 --> 00:28:53.750
since such a long time....

00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:55.843
you must be having a
lot of problems....!

00:28:57.416 --> 00:28:59.083
Yes... a bit... Sir....

00:28:59.291 --> 00:28:59.750
This is....

00:28:59.875 --> 00:29:04.250
..a matter of shame for a
jewel employee like you...!

00:29:04.458 --> 00:29:05.458
No no....!

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.833
From now onwards, you'll
stay at my place....!

00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:11.375
At your place...?

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.083
No..no Sir...

00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:15.833
Colleagues will say a lot of things Sir...!

00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:18.916
And moreover, I am not
your special relative...

00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:20.500
that I'll stay at your place...

00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:22.083
Uhh... well...

00:29:22.958 --> 00:29:26.416
What if... you stay as a
special relative of mine....?

00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:31.166
I didn't understand Sir....

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.416
I want my....

00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.000
daughter Suchitra,

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.708
on whose name I've built
'Suchitra Emporium',

00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:42.625
to get married to you.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.500
You know,

00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:04.916
..when I was a kid,

00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:07.250
I read in fantasy tales....

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.833
A beggar getting married to,

00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:14.875
a princess.....!

00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:24.750
My story is.....

00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.208
just like that.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.250
Suchitra...!

00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:54.291
..Suchitra....!

00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:51.125
Now I understood...!

00:31:51.458 --> 00:31:53.582
Why you married off your daughter...

00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:55.125
to one of your poor employees...!

00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:02.958
See Ushapati....!

00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:05.375
Suchitra is immature....

00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:07.500
A motherless daughter...

00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:10.499
The present societal illness that
is trending,

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.541
made her commit such a mistake....

00:32:13.208 --> 00:32:18.291
No one is truthful these days,
not even family members...

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.708
Let's keep it a secret to
the outside world....!

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:23.166
Anyway...!

00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:24.958
What's done cannot be undone....!

00:32:25.333 --> 00:32:28.666
My daughter is a gem of a person...!

00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:30.041
Pardon me...!

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:33.614
But I won't be able to take
this dirty responsibility...!

00:32:35.208 --> 00:32:36.208
Listen Usha....!

00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:37.333
Listen...!

00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:38.875
Don't get excited...!

00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:40.500
Listen to me....!

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:41.958
Come to the shop with me...!

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
No!

00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:44.533
I won't work there anymore...!

00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:45.916
I am going away...!

00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:46.916
Wait....!!

00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:50.374
From today, you are fifty percent owner of
'Suchitra Emporium"...

00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:51.916
my partner....!

00:32:53.416 --> 00:32:54.416
Yes.....!

00:32:54.458 --> 00:32:56.916
I had already mentioned it in my will.

00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:57.833
From today....

00:32:57.834 --> 00:33:00.666
just as I give the
orders in the shop...

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:02.666
all will be obey you as well..!

00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:04.875
Come to office....!

00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:06.851
Even though the princess
had an unremovable stain,

00:33:06.875 --> 00:33:09.208
I saw half of the empire
being offered to me....!

00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:10.416
This is....

00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:11.333
your office...!

00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:12.333
And....

00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:14.083
this is your chair....!

00:33:14.458 --> 00:33:15.958
You'll sit here....!

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:18.083
Go!

00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:19.875
And sit....!

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:23.500
Just go and sit.....!

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:30.540
And this is your.....

00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:32.083
partnership documents.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.041
Read it properly before you....

00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:36.916
sign it...!

00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:45.333
A lot of money....

00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:47.500
I couldn't resist!

00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:51.208
Since then... I....

00:33:51.458 --> 00:33:53.875
..statrted staying at my in-laws' place.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500
but....

00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:57.250
..with my wife....

00:33:58.291 --> 00:33:59.833
I had no relation....

00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:02.833
But outsiders....

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.291
didn't know anything about this....

00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:13.499
Mr. Dhananjay....!
- Yes...!

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.500
I am going to take Suchitra to London for
her treatment...!

00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:17.708
That's why,

00:34:17.708 --> 00:34:18.083
uhh...

00:34:18.541 --> 00:34:21.500
I have to stay there for almost a year...

00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:23.332
Ohh....

00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:24.874
That means Mr. Ushapati
will also accompany you..?

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:25.875
No no....!

00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:28.166
If he goes who will be
in charge of the shop?

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.916
He is the boss of this
emporium in my absence...!

00:34:33.416 --> 00:34:35.790
You all will cooperate
with him in every way.

00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:37.958
Yes... definitely... definitely...!

00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:01.375
After almost one year....

00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:05.083
My father-in-law returned from London.

00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:08.255
Suchitra was holding a
baby boy in her arms...

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.333
But whether he was two, or five months old,

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:15.250
couldn't be guessed at all...!

00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:41.958
Here.... - He's such a sweetheart..!
- Just a bit more...

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.500
It's almost finished... have it...

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.291
And from then onwards,

00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:49.000
what started, was our...

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.833
life, devoid of any emotions.

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:55.208
Now sleeping time....!

00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:58.291
Years went by.....

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.666
and likewise....

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.875
Satyakam started growing up.....

00:36:01.958 --> 00:36:03.798
But the blood of his
characterless father.....

00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:06.666
was flowing in his veins....!

00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:09.583
And that's why....

00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:13.083
before anything could be said to him,

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.125
he started developing a
new characteristic trait....!

00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:21.916
As he grew up, Satyakam...

00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:25.333
clearly started showing
traits of his father...!

00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:27.833
You know Mr. Byomkesh....!

00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:30.666
Any stain is removable.

00:36:31.583 --> 00:36:34.458
Except....stain of the character....!

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:38.791
It leaves its impression behind.....

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:44.666
He had earned his grandfather's
affection in such a way,

00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:48.041
..that even if he knew everything,
he couldn't say a word to him...

00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:50.833
Now Mr. Byomkesh, you say....!

00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:55.500
Can any man ever love his
wife's an illegal child?

00:36:56.333 --> 00:36:59.125
And a child, whose
character is like this...!

00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:05.291
That's why Satyakam, between
me and my wife Suchitra...

00:37:05.708 --> 00:37:08.416
stood as a barrier...

00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:12.958
When did Satyakam come to know
about his birth identity?

00:37:13.083 --> 00:37:15.500
After my father-in-law passed away.

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:16.833
He.....

00:37:17.666 --> 00:37:21.333
..had mentioned in his will his
share of the emporium for Satyakam.

00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:56.625
Satya...!

00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:01.416
You are drunk...???!!

00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:03.833
I am....

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.375
still drinking....!

00:38:05.708 --> 00:38:06.708
Satya...!

00:38:07.416 --> 00:38:08.957
I have told you a lot of times.....

00:38:08.958 --> 00:38:12.165
not to enter the house like
this at such late hours...!

00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:13.458
This is my house....

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:15.541
I'll enter whenever I want...!

00:38:18.916 --> 00:38:20.458
Devil may care....!

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.624
Listen.....I was saying.....that.....

00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:26.040
My goodness...!

00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:27.625
You also have a say....!

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.875
Carry on...!

00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:29.875
Satyakam...!

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:32.708
I will not stand such filthy
behavior in my house!

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:35.125
Did you just say 'filthy behaviour'?

00:38:36.083 --> 00:38:38.833
Was I the first to start
it in this house...?

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.166
huhh??

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.500
What..?!

00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:48.363
There's no answer, naturally...!

00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:18.291
After my father-in-law passed away....

00:39:20.083 --> 00:39:21.624
slowly, the shop's condition....

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.166
started degrading.

00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:29.625
Satyakam started splurging
a lot of money.....

00:39:30.875 --> 00:39:33.125
on his extravagant lecherous lifestyle.

00:39:36.416 --> 00:39:37.958
Infact Mr. Byomkesh,

00:39:40.041 --> 00:39:41.583
..women of well-bred families,

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:46.208
stopped coming to the shop due to him.

00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:51.665
Right at this point,

00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:53.250
something happened....

00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:56.582
Because of this offspring,

00:39:56.583 --> 00:39:58.290
an innocent person got.....

00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:01.457
nothing but pain from
me, all through his life,

00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:05.708
Just see what a demon I have
reared brother Sahodeb...!

00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:12.083
I can't take it anymore....!

00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:17.833
One after the other... his activities....!

00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:19.208
Oh God....!

00:40:20.458 --> 00:40:23.415
How do I repay for my mistakes....!

00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:25.957
I... I just can't take it anymore....!

00:40:25.958 --> 00:40:26.958
Madam...!

00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:28.833
Atleast have some water....!

00:40:29.083 --> 00:40:31.625
I won't be able to gulp it
even brother Sahodeb...!

00:40:31.666 --> 00:40:35.249
You go... I have to be alone for some time.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:36.083
Go....!

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.250
Go......

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Wait.

00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:50.166
What happened?

00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:53.666
The next door lady came and....

00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:56.791
insulted madam like anything...!

00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:57.916
Why...!

00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:02.082
Junior master ...with her daughter...

00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.750
Ok fine...!

00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:18.332
And that day, you decided....

00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:20.166
to end Satyakam's life.

00:41:25.375 --> 00:41:26.874
A father murdered his son...

00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:28.395
no one would even believe that....!

00:41:31.166 --> 00:41:33.666
Other than that, Satyakam
had too many enemies...!

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.332
So naturally, they will
be suspected more...!

00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:39.333
Stilll...

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.249
The way you executed the murder,

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.541
that you don't get
noticed at all......!

00:41:56.291 --> 00:41:56.916
And that's why,

00:41:56.917 --> 00:42:00.125
you thought of a foolproof plan....

00:42:05.833 --> 00:42:08.291
You first got hold of a foil paper disc.

00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:10.708
Then, on Saturday night....

00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:12.636
after everyone in the house fell asleep,

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.541
and before Satyakam reached home.

00:42:18.625 --> 00:42:21.958
..around.... 11:00 - 11:30 I guess,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.125
you glued the disc to the main door.

00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:32.125
Indeed...! What an idea....

00:42:34.583 --> 00:42:36.083
to attract his vision...!

00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:49.750
And, you definitely had got hold of a
revolver beforehand....!

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.250
Brother Bashir...!

00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:54.041
Someone has come to meet you...!

00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:14.833
And then, probably...

00:44:15.541 --> 00:44:17.375
around midnight,

00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:21.165
..a drunk Satyakam, entered
from the main gate, and....

00:44:21.166 --> 00:44:23.666
and, exactly as per your plan....

00:44:23.833 --> 00:44:25.415
could see the disc with his torch.

00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:26.416
What's that shining over there....?

00:44:26.417 --> 00:44:29.708
..and to get a better glimpse
of it, as he leaned towards it,

00:44:55.375 --> 00:44:57.750
Oh no...! Junior master....!

00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:05.250
What happened to your junior master...!

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:10.000
What happened to you....!?

00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:17.749
You had framed it in such a way.....

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.875
so it seemed that he
was shot from behind....!

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:26.750
No one will ever imagine, that he was shot
from above...!

00:45:28.416 --> 00:45:29.874
Had I not seen that disc,

00:45:29.875 --> 00:45:31.875
even I would have
imagined the same....!

00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:34.665
But what I still cannot figure out is,

00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:37.875
you did not hide the disc...!

00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:39.416
Why??

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.916
Because I didn't know
that you will come....!

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.625
Did you feel slightly bad at that time....?

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:14.333
Is it??

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:36.750
Mr. Byomkesh...!

00:46:37.791 --> 00:46:40.708
Since the last 19 years, I and
my husband...

00:46:42.875 --> 00:46:46.666
have been living in a graveyard in the
name of married life...

00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:48.875
So I just want....

00:46:49.375 --> 00:46:51.416
to forget everything about the past....

00:46:52.791 --> 00:46:54.875
and start anew.

00:46:56.625 --> 00:46:58.541
just want some peace....!

00:46:59.625 --> 00:47:01.041
I would request you...

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.500
not to churn the case anymore...!

00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:29.000
Fine...

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I won't.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.750
But why..?

00:47:36.958 --> 00:47:37.500
You won't...

00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:39.375
inform the police?

00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:43.458
Uhh.....

00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:44.708
No!

00:47:44.916 --> 00:47:45.916
I won't..!

00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:52.832
But it won't be....

00:47:52.833 --> 00:47:55.208
lawful as per your
principles, Mr. Byomkesh...!

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.250
Yes... yes....

00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.666
you are right....

00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:04.624
But see, Satyakam had told me....

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:07.541
..to find out the cause of his murder....

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.541
to discover the truth!

00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:14.833
not to hand over the
murder to the police...!

00:48:16.708 --> 00:48:19.750
And there's another law
beyond the law itself...

00:48:20.833 --> 00:48:22.041
humanity....!

00:48:28.958 --> 00:48:31.291
And this... okay fine....that's it.

00:48:34.583 --> 00:48:35.625
Take care....

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:13.458
Now you both tell me....

00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:14.791
Did I do anything wrong?

00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:15.833
No...!

00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:17.250
But I thought that...

00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:18.665
Annapurna is the murderer...!

00:49:18.666 --> 00:49:19.666
No no...!

00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:21.000
See...

00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:24.458
She is the murderer.....

00:49:25.458 --> 00:49:30.708
of the father of the child
she's carrying in her womb.....

00:49:31.583 --> 00:49:33.750
These two facts don't go
along, as per my belief.

00:49:35.041 --> 00:49:38.000
No Satya, she truely loved Satyakam...!

00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:39.291
No no..Byomkesh...

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.915
Your heart melted by seeing
Annapurna's tears...

00:49:42.916 --> 00:49:44.541
You cannot say that!

00:49:44.875 --> 00:49:48.540
When the Pandavas saw Draupadi crying, they
announced war at Kurukshetra..! (Mythology)

00:49:48.541 --> 00:49:51.000
What value do you know of tears....!

00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:52.333
Bachelor...!

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.250
Don't talk rubbish....!

00:49:54.708 --> 00:49:56.416
Why are you getting angry Ajit....?

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:03.083
Love strikes all, young or old....!

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.625
I firmly believe you know,

00:50:05.666 --> 00:50:09.791
Mr. Ushapati wouldn't have murdered,
if this wasn't the Springtime...!

00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:16.333
Thank God Mr. Dhananjay kept his
poetic creation safe with him...!

00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:19.791
Not again...! "Usha became
pati (husband)" ...!

00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:21.499
Don't be so rude Ajit...!

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.499
It's his only existing
creation of literature...!

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.291
Absolutely..! - No you just think...!

00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:30.458
Who would keep it as a keepsake
all through these years...!

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.125
I couldn't have solved the
mystery without seeing it...!

00:50:33.916 --> 00:50:36.415
Anyway...! That's it..! Brother-in-law...!

00:50:36.416 --> 00:50:36.916
Yes...?

00:50:36.917 --> 00:50:38.250
What about the tickets...?

00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:39.583
Ohh right...!

00:50:42.416 --> 00:50:43.500
Here you go...! - Ohh...!

00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:45.833
You got them....! - Hmm..

00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:49.333
But... why two tickets..? Aren't you going?

00:50:50.166 --> 00:50:51.246
Leave it sister-in-law....!

00:50:51.833 --> 00:50:55.290
I won't be disturbing you two there.

00:50:55.291 --> 00:50:57.665
My character is not degrading
like your husband's...!

00:50:57.666 --> 00:50:59.000
Thank heavens for that...!

00:51:00.333 --> 00:51:01.333
Satya...!

00:51:01.833 --> 00:51:02.333
C'mon...!

00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:03.708
Wait..! Where are you going..?

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:06.750
At Bichitra theatre....!

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.160
"Characterless!" (Movie Name)

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.332
Ohh... that's why she's so
decked up since evening...!

00:51:16.333 --> 00:51:18.832
C'mon let's go..! Let's not
waste any more time...!

00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:19.291
Let's go.

00:51:19.333 --> 00:51:25.250
Hey..! What will I do here
all by myself now....!

00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:34.208
You want to go, but alas....!

00:51:34.375 --> 00:51:36.875
Nothing to say...!

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.457
But why again so full of
literary theories my dear...??

00:51:40.458 --> 00:51:41.833
The reason is....

00:51:42.791 --> 00:51:47.415
Now you will have to write
about this case of mine...

00:51:47.416 --> 00:51:49.250
in poetic verses...!

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:50.500
C'mon Satya...!

00:51:50.501 --> 00:51:53.291
Detective story... in
the form of poetry...?

00:51:55.958 --> 00:52:03.958
I have a feeling, this literary work
of yours will be revolutionary...!

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
What say Banerjee...?

00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:09.416
Let's...?

00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:11.708
C'mon... let's go...!

00:52:11.833 --> 00:52:19.833
Detective story in the form of poetry....?

00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:27.916
"Let's...!"
