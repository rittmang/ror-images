WEBVTT

00:00:54.917 --> 00:01:00.875
Hey Debasish. Come in. How
is your married life?

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:02.042
Not bad.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:11.417
A married man has come
here, Prabal. Play some Mozart!

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:16.583
The sad tunes of Beethoven
won't work now.

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:25.333
Even married life is one hell of
a ride! You'll know with time!

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:26.583
There you go!

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.875
Anyway, if you like it...
so be it!

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:40.083
There is a strange pessimistic
kind of people in this world.

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:43.750
Pass me a cigarette, Nripati!

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.292
I've lost my cigarette case.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.625
Just see if I left it at
your place, Debasish.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:55.917
But better you have a reality check.
Else things will go down.

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:00.125
Just look at our hero!

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:02.588
He doesn't even have time
to remove the make-up.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.875
He's recognized easily these days.
Is it?

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:11.542
That's why he even wears make-up
even as he goes out... Nice!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.167
Again! This time a laborer,
after the beggar

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.667
Did you see this?

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.792
A laborer killed by
a porcupine's thorn.

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.833
This is the second time this
happened in our locality.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.542
Hey!
Where do you want to go?

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.750
Let's go!
Where?

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.833
Will take a trip around Kolkata.
Okay. Sit.

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:28.667
Nripati, how can someone
kill by a porcupine's thorn?

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.958
Will it not break?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.125
If the thorn is weak, it will get
crooked. But won't break.

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:44.167
And if it's sharp enough,
it will pierce the skin.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:49.417
But what will someone
gain out of killing them?

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:54.500
There are misers
even among the poor.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.124
This might be the
work of such a greedy-

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.832
I think this is the
work of a mad man!

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:01.833
Might be!

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:07.792
Yes. Else why will someone kill with a
porcupine thorn instead of knives and guns?!

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:10.125
That's right!

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.458
Have you ever seen a bad wife?
No. I'm poor. I'm unmarried.

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:29.083
You're saved. Look at me.
I don't even have any children.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.167
She doesn't even
let me touch her!

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:39.125
Want to listen to Ghalib?
No. Why? I'm not interested.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:46.000
"Are you alone or
there's someone with you?!"

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.250
Huh?

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:58.167
I'm seeing two of everything!

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:06.375
(singing a Bengali song, drunk)

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:45.292
Hello sister-in-law?
Did you reach safely?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.531
Didn't face any troubles I hope?

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:52.875
Ghatsila's cold, huh?
Take care of yourself!

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.667
What can I do? It's Mr.Bidhu's
daughter's marriage! I had to go!

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.625
Yes. I'm coming by tomorrow's
morning train.

00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:09.458
Yes. I'm good. I'll let Byomkesh
know once he comes.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.542
Okay. Talk to you later.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:20.500
This is the third victim!

00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.667
First, a beggar. Then a
laborer and now a shopkeeper!

00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:32.250
And why a porcupine
thorn all of a sudden?

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:38.333
I think he has some other intentions!

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:47.708
Do you think his motifs for all
the murders are the same?

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:54.833
I guess so. When will
Mr.Byomkesh come back?

00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:59.042
Byomkesh... Wait a minute!

00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:08.667
Yes. Hang on. You have a call.

00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:22.000
Yes. I'm on my way.

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:26.667
We have got another victim. Has
been brought to the hospital.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.250
Did Byomkesh tell you
when he'll be back?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.292
He should have been back by
now. Not sure if he got busy.

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:19.083
Let me see.
I guess Byomkesh-

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:25.292
Got him.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Leave him. Leave him.
Please pardon me.

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:49.667
What happened?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.833
Byomkesh, what's this?

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:54.917
Let's go to a doctor!
No. I'm fine.

00:08:55.542 --> 00:09:00.042
I'm not getting this. You're being
beaten up in public just like that?

00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:06.500
This is still better. Thank God
he didn't harm my eyes or ears!

00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:12.458
This is that case I told you about! The
criminal has a black mark on his waist!

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.333
Anyway, is this genteman alive?

00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:18.292
Let's go to the hospital and find out! Wait!
Why're you getting yourself into this?

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:20.824
We have to visit Ghatsila tomorrow.
Sister-in-law called!

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.875
Hard to resist when something
like this comes up, Ajit!

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:27.083
Bet he's rich, huh?

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:29.458
Yes. but how do you know?

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:34.625
First a beggar. Then a labourer.
Now it ought to be someone richer!

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:36.542
Let's go.

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:49.667
Hello. I'm Byomkesh Bakshi. A truth
seeker. You're Debasish's wife, right?

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.708
Is he alive?

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.125
Can you please tell me?

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:12.000
I can't do this.
Ajit, please sit.

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:21.375
Is it right to leave such an interesting case
and go to Ghatsila to see Satya's relatives?

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:24.500
Why don't you
explain that to her?

00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:36.583
You aren't married. That's
why you can say this.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:41.625
I can't lie to her.
Don't bullshit me.

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.375
You cook up such nice stories
while writing. Then?

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.125
And now you can't
help a friend?!

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:55.792
Ajit, go now! Pick up the
phone! Come on! Go please!

00:11:56.333 --> 00:12:04.333
Leave my dhoti.
Ajit, first pick up the call!

00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:12.250
Hello. How are
you? All good?

00:12:13.042 --> 00:12:17.125
Yes. All was good. But-

00:12:17.417 --> 00:12:19.875
But?
No. I mean Byomkesh!

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:22.250
His mouth is wide open!

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.750
What do you mean?

00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:28.875
No. He's just drunk.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.083
Drunk? What do you mean?

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:35.917
I mean all his intestines
have come out of his mouth.

00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:41.708
Please tell me in details
what exactly happened?

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:44.167
Cover the speaker.

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.583
Tell her that I've
fallen sick suddenly.

00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:50.583
"Tell her that I've
fallen sick suddenly"

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.208
Who?
Say, "Me"!

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:58.042
Me!...No, I mean Byomkesh!

00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.542
Did he have medicines?

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:08.083
Yes. He had sleeping pills
and now he's fast asleep.

00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:13.500
Listen. You don't need
to come here like this.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.125
Yes. That's better.

00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:26.167
All this happens when I'm not there. Thought of
staying here for a few days. Shall I come back now?

00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:29.917
Yes... I mean you want to come back?

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:38.583
Stay there for a few weeks.
Dance... I mean enjoy yourself!

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:45.500
Okay. Keep me posted.
And look after him.

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:49.583
Yes. I am... I mean I will.
Now he's sleeping.

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.125
Okay. Talk later.

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:56.917
Thank God!

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:27.917
I went to the hospital.
I met Mrs. Dipa there.

00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:30.792
I knew something like this would happen.
Is it?

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.250
How?

00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:37.833
Speak up!

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:45.417
Look Mr.Bijoy, if you try to safe
guard the killer, he will strike again.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.750
Do you want that?

00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:50.667
But I don't know
the entire truth.

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:55.167
Tell us what you know as of now.

00:14:58.958 --> 00:14:59.958
Alright then.

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.833
I have a solution to
your problem, Dipa.

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:10.125
Divorce!

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.125
No.
Why not?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.625
Your family doesn't
know about your secret?

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.792
No... Then they should
correct themselves. Isn't it?

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:27.042
Then you can't save my grandpa.

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:42.250
Nice. This looks good. Great!

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:50.542
So what I suggest is that no need to study
anymore. It's enough for a girl!

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Instead get her married.

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:09.458
And listen, girl, don't step
out of the house from tomorrow.

00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:17.375
And the groom should
be of our cast.

00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.292
Okay Dad. I'll look into it.

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:34.417
Sandhya, please check if the father-in-law
had his medicines or not.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.750
Why will this happen?

00:16:46.542 --> 00:16:48.792
Girls of another country
do not face all this.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.042
Why do I need to marry
the groom of his choice?

00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:56.167
Don't I have my own will?

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:02.542
Can you tell this on his face?

00:17:06.417 --> 00:17:07.500
Can you?

00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:14.583
Are you done?
Make it quick!

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:31.875
What's up? Don't get to see
you much these days! Why?

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:37.083
Grandpa, I got your food and
medicine this morning... Is it?

00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:42.625
Do you want to say something?

00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:52.000
Actually, I want to marry someone.
But his caste is different!

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:53.125
What?!!!

00:17:56.208 --> 00:18:03.417
Am I dead? You think you're born in a lower
caste? You can do anything you want?

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:07.667
I'm dead or what?
Listen carefully!

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:16.333
You'll marry the person
I'll decide. Got that?

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.500
Get out of here! Get out!

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:29.125
Dipa, who do you want to marry?

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:32.375
I won't tell you!

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.833
So, how old is Dipa?

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:47.167
We don't have much younger
girls in our family... Got you!

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.333
That's all good.

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:53.833
So what kind of groom
are you looking for?

00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:58.208
A rich, good looking
and educated one, huh?

00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:01.792
And most importantly, he
should belong to our caste!

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:04.417
After all, it's about
generation!

00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:14.000
You are Mukherjees right?
Will Narendra work for you?

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:19.708
No, Nripati. We have
maintained our legacy.

00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:27.625
I know. You guys are
like cockroaches.

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:33.458
Didn't get it? Cockroaches
are ancient creatures.

00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:35.500
They thrived even years before.

00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:41.958
Other creatures evolved. But
cockroaches remained as they are.

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:50.792
That's why they have no respect.
Anyway, I know of a groom.

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:55.458
Debasish Bhatta. New
to our club.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.250
Yes. I know him.

00:19:58.417 --> 00:19:59.583
So how are you Prabal?

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:02.750
You guys know each other?
A little. Not much.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:11.708
How is your "Projapoti Prosadhon" coming
along? It has become quite famous!

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:16.583
You too. Heard your song
on the radio a few days ago.

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:21.417
I knew you could sing well. But didn't know
you could play the piano so well too.

00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:27.125
Debasish, come here.

00:20:28.042 --> 00:20:34.167
He's always absent-minded. After all
an artist you see. Have a seat.

00:20:34.875 --> 00:20:36.833
Don't take his words to heart.

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:41.750
And let me introduce. This is
Kapil. Kapil, meet Debasish.

00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:45.542
Nripati, can I use your telephone?
Yes. Surely. Go ahead.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.333
Nripati!
Yes?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.625
I'll take a leave today.
Why so early?

00:20:53.292 --> 00:20:58.167
Need to go to All India Radio. Have
a meeting with Sachin Dev Barman.

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:02.708
Look at him. By the
way, how's your wife?

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.542
Forgot to tell you. She passed
away a few months back.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:24.375
She had a heart problem. And if not operated
early, the patient dies within 22 years.

00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:41.792
And her father didn't tell me
about this at the time of marriage.

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:43.833
Bye.

00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:46.833
Leaving?

00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:49.417
Why don't sing a song for us?

00:21:50.125 --> 00:21:54.042
Kapil, you need to pay
me to listen to my song.

00:21:56.708 --> 00:22:04.375
Why will I pay to listen to you? Instead, I will buy
records of that singer called Hemanta Mukherjee!

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:11.667
Bye, Nripati.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:17.250
Actually, he was not in
the right mood today.

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:21.875
Prabal is always agitated.
It's his problem.

00:22:22.833 --> 00:22:28.792
No point in blaming him, Kapil. His wife
passed away a few months back.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.417
Kapil's not a bad person. But
yes, he has a problem.

00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:42.542
He doesn't want to marry. God
knows if he's having an affair.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:46.458
But he's quite ambitious.

00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:51.000
At the stars in the sky.

00:22:53.542 --> 00:22:55.542
What are you up to at night?

00:22:56.667 --> 00:23:00.458
Today one can see the Mars
at quarter to twelve.

00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:04.750
Arranging for that!
Mars, huh?

00:23:05.208 --> 00:23:07.375
Only you know what
you're haunted by!

00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:13.625
Everyone has kept their windows
open while sleeping. It's so hot.

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:17.042
Hope you're not trying to
look at their windows!

00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:19.000
Then it'll be a big problem.

00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:23.042
God you're pathetic!
Go and sleep now.

00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:25.292
He slept with his other wife.

00:23:25.625 --> 00:23:26.708
The law book!

00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:31.833
He wants to have coffee. Do
you want coffee as well?

00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:34.125
I don't have time for all that.

00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:36.250
Think yourself to
be Galileo or what?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.667
Be careful. You'll hurt yourself.

00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:46.458
He's quite powerful, huh?

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:51.417
So Kharga Bahadur weren't you supposed
to go to your native to get married?

00:23:51.958 --> 00:23:57.917
Yes. But then I got a letter and
heard it's been postponed.

00:23:58.208 --> 00:24:00.833
It got postponed?
Good for you!

00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:04.792
Heard you played really well
against Mohunbagan yesterday?

00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:10.083
You managed to evade Goshto
Pal's Chinse Wall and score a goal?

00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:16.125
Goshto Pal's now old. Guess
he'll retire. But how do you know?

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.917
Our production manager went
to see the game. He's your big fan.

00:24:22.042 --> 00:24:27.708
By the way Debasish, what do
you love more? Football or cinema?

00:24:28.417 --> 00:24:33.583
I love both. Have seen both of you many
times in fields and screens respectively!

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:36.542
Let me introduce...

00:24:36.792 --> 00:24:40.708
This is Bijoy Madhav Mukherjee... Hello!
And this is Debasish Bhatta.

00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:44.500
Bijoy comes from a family of lecturers.

00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:48.208
He has a degree in Sanskrit
and now looking for jobs.

00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:50.500
So, you guys chat. Okay?

00:24:53.875 --> 00:25:00.583
Okay. Let me see what
you guys are up to.

00:25:46.458 --> 00:25:53.542
Another option will be to return to your
paternal house, where you used to live.

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:57.292
They'll again send me back.

00:25:58.292 --> 00:26:00.292
And that will lead to gossips.

00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:06.250
Then you have to stay here.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.708
But we'll stay separately.

00:26:10.417 --> 00:26:18.417
But to avoid public shaming, we have
to pretend as a married couple.

00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:21.958
Can you?
Yes!

00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:34.833
You?

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:42.458
No. he sleeps separately.
Doesn't mess with me.

00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:47.833
But for how long?

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:55.667
No. I didn't tell your
name. I promised.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.042
No. I won't tell anyone.

00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:06.917
Yes.
Sister?

00:28:08.417 --> 00:28:09.417
Come. Eat.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.458
You go ahead Nakulda. I'm coming.
Okay. Fine.

00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:25.458
What does Debasish do?

00:28:25.917 --> 00:28:30.333
He owns "Projapoti Prosadhan".
Ah! Heard about that.

00:28:32.542 --> 00:28:33.792
He doesn't have any relatives?

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:41.250
I guess there's none. His factory
workers are like his relatives.

00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:48.500
Dipa, I'm not forcing you
to come to the factory.

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:56.333
Factory workers were nagging me
for long... No, I'm coming at my own will.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:05.750
It's better you refer me as "Tumi"
instead of "Apni". Hope you understand.

00:29:06.208 --> 00:29:07.208
Got it.

00:30:09.042 --> 00:30:17.042
The workers really love him. He keeps only a part of
the income to himself and donates the rest among them.

00:30:24.542 --> 00:30:29.667
What's the gross income from the factory?
One and a half lakhs, I have heard!

00:30:54.792 --> 00:30:57.625
I have decorated the flower
vases. Want to see?

00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:00.875
If you would like...

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.833
Do you like flowers?

00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:29.500
You like gardening?

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:32.833
Did it on the terrace of
my paternal house.

00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:34.375
My own small garden.

00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:37.208
Is it?
Yes.

00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:21.833
Yes. All good.

00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:26.667
No. He did nothing wrong.

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:29.583
But how long
will this go on for?

00:33:40.042 --> 00:33:43.333
Let's go.
Marriage hasn't affected you much.

00:33:44.542 --> 00:33:48.125
You are still the same.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.958
But why are you wearing
such less jewelry?

00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:07.458
But not bad. Reminds me
of that poem by Gobinda Das

00:34:12.792 --> 00:34:13.792
Sorry?

00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:17.875
It means that jewelry often
becomes unwanted in a marriage.

00:34:18.958 --> 00:34:21.625
You have become quite a tease!

00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:26.333
You'll also become one. Every
girl does after her marriage.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.500
How are you getting along
with your husband?

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.917
Good... Your husband's really handsome!

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:38.500
How is he as a person?

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:27.083
Won't you share anything with me?
I used to tell you everything.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:36.792
Don't stay mum in front of
your husband. He'll get you wrong.

00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:48.792
Who all were Debasish's friends?

00:35:50.042 --> 00:35:58.042
Don't know about others. But he
was close to the ones at Nripati's place.

00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:09.792
Among them is Prabal, a musician. His
songs are often played on the radio.

00:36:13.375 --> 00:36:21.375
Sujan Kumar is a screen actor. He's quite popular.
So now he disguises himself when he goes out.

00:36:25.708 --> 00:36:31.125
Do you go to Nripati's
house regularly?

00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:32.333
Yes. Quite often.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:41.750
Didn't Dipa accept Debasish
as her husband at all?

00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:50.208
No. She's very kind. When
Debasish got sick, she looked after him.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.292
Hello, Uncle Sen? This is Dipa.

00:36:56.417 --> 00:37:04.417
My husband's not well. I don't know
his family physician. Can you come?

00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:32.750
Don't worry. I'm prescribing
some medicines. You'll be fine.

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:38.417
But you... Yes, Doctor. Everything
in my life is reversed.

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:48.458
You'll be fine in a day or two. Sleep now. I'll be
back tomorrow morning. Also, call your own doctor.

00:37:58.083 --> 00:37:59.083
Uncle Sen!

00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:02.667
What is it?

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.833
Let me call the gardener.

00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:41.167
Dipa!

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:50.625
Dipa, I'm thinking to invite
my friends for tea next Sunday.

00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:52.125
What do you think?

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.458
A shopkeeper!

00:40:04.708 --> 00:40:06.208
Did you notice one thing?

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.958
First, a beggar. Then a laborer
and now a shopkeeper.

00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:14.542
The killer is working his way up.

00:40:15.583 --> 00:40:17.250
Who will be the next victim?

00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:23.583
Possibly a famous footballer!

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:30.250
Or maybe a famous film actor!

00:40:31.958 --> 00:40:35.417
Or a famous singer!

00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:46.042
But why only famous!
He can also be rich!

00:41:10.792 --> 00:41:16.125
Don't act smart. Among those who came
today, with whom are you having an affair?

00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:17.625
Tell me his name!

00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:18.958
I won't tell you!

00:41:19.167 --> 00:41:25.625
You won't? I'll kill him if
I get to know myself!

00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:42.333
What is it?
Is sister Dipa unwell?

00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:46.083
How does it matter? Let's go!

00:41:47.125 --> 00:41:48.125
Come!

00:41:50.958 --> 00:41:55.042
I know Kharga Bahadur is a good
footballer. But how is he as a person?

00:41:55.542 --> 00:41:57.542
Not bad.

00:41:58.333 --> 00:42:02.333
But he's addicted to gambling.

00:42:06.375 --> 00:42:08.917
Did Debasish go to
the "adda" yesterday?

00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:11.833
No.

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:45.750
Nice! Nakul made
some really good tea today!

00:42:48.583 --> 00:42:51.917
Not Nakul. It's me.

00:42:53.667 --> 00:42:54.667
Is it?

00:42:57.083 --> 00:42:59.500
Really nice!

00:43:04.125 --> 00:43:09.708
Will you take me to see a movie today?

00:43:18.208 --> 00:43:23.917
You don't have to go to the cinema
with me just to make me happy.

00:43:26.708 --> 00:43:34.708
No. Not that. You mentioned about a new
film of Sujan Kumar. Will you take me?

00:43:38.208 --> 00:43:39.208
Yes...

00:43:49.417 --> 00:43:51.292
Hello. This is
Debasish Bhatta.

00:43:52.667 --> 00:43:54.083
Oh. How are you?

00:43:55.208 --> 00:43:57.625
No, I didn't go.
I am good.

00:43:58.875 --> 00:43:59.917
I'm at home.

00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:02.542
Now?

00:44:04.125 --> 00:44:06.792
No, it's fine.
I'll be there.

00:44:12.208 --> 00:44:19.417
Dipa, I need to leave now. I'll
be back within half an hour.

00:44:45.167 --> 00:44:48.167
Sister, where did
Mr.Debasish go?

00:44:48.417 --> 00:44:49.417
When will he be back?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.208
I don't know. He said
within half an hour.

00:44:53.667 --> 00:45:00.417
But it's more than half an hour
now. He isn't late usually.

00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:21.875
No. He's not here. Why?

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:26.708
No. I didn't tell
anyone about you.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:13.042
I'm not liking this. He
isn't so late usually.

00:46:18.958 --> 00:46:19.958
Hello?

00:46:21.292 --> 00:46:22.292
Yes?

00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:27.708
Is he alive?
