WEBVTT

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.960
(indistinct chatter)

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.279
It's done.
Come out now.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.560
Hey! Get out now.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.160
<i>Sometimes, such cyclones blow
over the currents of time...</i>

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.800
<i>that the scars remain forever.</i>

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.999
<i>It was 1350 according
to the Bengali calendar...</i>

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.320
<i>and 1943 according
to the English calendar.</i>

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.640
<i>The British were in a terrible condition
on three continents.</i>

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.120
<i>Adding to that was the Quit India Movement
of 1942.</i>

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.560
<i>Last year on 16 October, a horrible cyclone
in Midnapore killed nearly 30,000 people.</i>

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.720
<i>From January, dozens of villagers
started crowding the streets of Kolkata.</i>

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.559
<i>Japan captured Rangoon.</i>

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.000
<i>To provide for the soldiers,
panic spread across rice markets.</i>

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.319
<i>That gave rise to the black market.</i>

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.920
<i>The price of rice shot from
Rs. 3 to Rs. 40 per maund.</i>

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.279
<i>And the great British overlords...</i>

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.000
<i>turned a blind eye
to the dozens of people dying.</i>

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.759
<i>But we could not turn a blind eye to it.</i>

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.320
<i>Those screams consumed us.</i>

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.720
<i>We took to the streets
to help in whatever way we could.</i>

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.920
<i>Satyabati gathered the women
of our neighbourhood...</i>

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.920
<i>and set up a relief association.</i>

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.559
<i>The dearth of rice made Bengal suffer.</i>

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560
WE WANT FOOD, NOT WAR.
HELP US.

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:43.880
<i>And it was at Kolkata
that the British were preparing for war.</i>

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.959
<i>Describing the condition of India
at the House of Commons...</i>

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.199
<i>the British Prime Minister
Churchill said...</i>

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.719
<i>"I hate Indians.</i>

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.879
<i>They are a beastly people
with a beastly religion."</i>

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880
Let's go.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.360
<i>But the incident disturbed Byomkesh more
than any of us.</i>

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.760
THE MAHABHARATA

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.239
First, the sham
of the Cripps Mission...

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.120
And then the worthlessness
of the denial policy.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.679
And Churchill will still say

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.839
that the famine is caused
by overpopulation.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.640
Forgot what else Churchill had said?

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.999
That if the country is so famished,
why is Gandhi not dying?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.079
No! What is being passed off
as a natural disaster...

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.640
I'm sure it's a conspiracy
by Churchill.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.119
The British have two options now.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.999
Either the death of thousands of villagers
or chaos in Kolkata.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.319
So, you chose the first...

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.160
because chaos in Kolkata
would deter the your war situation.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.039
Please don't say 'your', Byomkesh.
It's quite hurtful.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.519
Let it hurt a little.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.599
You can't avoid your responsibilities
as an administrator, Bidhu.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.799
Hurtful, as if!

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.720
Yes, if I work for the rulers,
I must do as they say.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880
Damn it!

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.760
- How are you, Bidhu?
- I'm fine.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.200
How's your relief work?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.319
Not too well.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.760
Times are so bad, no one dares to spare
even a single rupee.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.400
Hmm, right...

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.200
- Please wait, I'll get some tea.
- No, no.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.439
You must be tired.
I won't have tea today.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.480
I have to leave now
for the Khidirpore dock.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.599
Some military groups are coming.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.159
Why did they have to make Kolkata
the base to fight Japan?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.440
Rubbish!

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.640
I'll take my leave.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.600
How far have you read?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.800
Hmm?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.440
I'm not feeling well, Satya.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.239
People are dying all around
and I'm researching epics.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.840
But our means are so limited.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.080
Is it okay to worry yourself sick
this way?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.759
- Here's a letter for you.
- Give it to Ajit.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.080
Please read it aloud, Ajit.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.480
Who's this from?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.719
"Dear Byomkesh, the intelligent one...

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.039
New Year greetings to you and Ajit."

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.559
It's Rameshwar Ray.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.400
"May your intellect grow by the day
like the moon.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.840
May Ajit's writing bloom
like a peacock's plume.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.719
It's time for me to go."

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.840
<i>I've been summoned by Yamaraja,
God of death.</i>

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.960
<i>There will be an arrest warrant
very soon.</i>

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.879
<i>Of late, while reading 'Krishnakanta's
Will' by Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay...</i>

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.880
<i>various thoughts have been coming
to mind.</i>

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.239
<i>I'm growing old.</i>

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.120
<i>So, I wrote a small poem
for God.</i>

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.639
<i>Sing praises of Paramahansa,
by dividing into two his name...</i>

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.680
<i>Beauty belongs to the second part
and God, the first does claim.</i>

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.119
<i>How did you like the poem?</i>

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.479
<i>I have immense faith
in your intellect.</i>

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.080
<i>Farewell."</i>

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.160
"Postscript...

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.800
Please save this letter
as my last memory.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.920
I'll check if you received Rs. 5000
from heaven.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.080
Farewell again...
Rameshwar Ray."

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.079
Rameshwar Ray...

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.560
- His factory was robbed...
- Hmm.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.240
It's been five or six years.
Are you still in touch?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.919
We don't meet
but he writes to me twice a year...

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.119
During New Year
and the Durga festival.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.399
It was after solving that case
that he grew so fond of your husband.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.520
He's a nice man.
Quick-witted and rich.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.119
I had a belief, you know...

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.639
that the Laxmi, Goddess of Wealth
only loves owls.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.720
He changed that.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.000
But Byomkesh,
what was the Rs. 5000 about?

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.120
Did he lose his mind with age?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.000
Did Bhishma become senile?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.279
You think Rameshwar is Bhishma?

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.719
I don't know...

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.119
- Ajit can you please get the door?
- I'll get it.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.520
Oh gosh!

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.239
Why did you lie down again?

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.960
We have visitors.
Get up!

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.920
How can I help you?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Greetings!

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.520
- Byomkesh?
- Yes?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.400
- Come in.
- Yes.

00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:52.760
Please come in.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.200
Please take a seat.

00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:57.960
- I'll be back.
- Hmm.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.840
Go on. Please take a seat.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.720
- Greetings, Byomkesh.
- Greetings. Please sit.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880
Er...

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.880
- I am Dr. Suresh Rakshit.
- Okay.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.880
Thank you.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.679
I'm here on behalf of a patient.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.680
Hmm.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.960
He isn't keeping well at all.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.480
Unless you give him some assurance,
it'll be very difficult to save him.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.080
What's the illness?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.120
Paralysis.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.239
Actually, he had a stroke
three months ago.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.200
Since then, he's bedridden.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.439
The lower part of his body
has no feelings.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.319
He can't move at all.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.360
Hmm.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.559
We could somehow save him then.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.440
But his blood pressure was very high.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.200
- Are you the house physician?
- So...

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.960
Yes.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.120
I live on the first floor
of his house on rent.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.240
He's a very wealthy man.
He's a money lender.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.599
You might know his name...

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.720
Bishu Pal.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.959
Who? Shishu Pal?

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.559
- No, Bishu Pal.
- Oh.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.719
Well, it's not like people don't call him
by that name...

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.959
Yeah, it's natural to call a usurer so
when there's a famine.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.479
No, Byomkesh.
He is actually very helpful.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.439
- Oh.
- Yes.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.039
He's not hungry for wealth.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.079
Really?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.079
He's helped everyone
in this time of need.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.000
And, a lot of...

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.439
I guess I should give you more details.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.680
- Hmm.
- Yes.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.839
He has a debtor, Abhay Ghoshal.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.639
- What Ghoshal?
- Abhay Ghoshal.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.800
Okay.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
So, a year ago...

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.240
<i>Abhay Ghoshal came to Bishu Pal
for a loan of Rs. 30,000.</i>

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.999
Dad respected you a lot...

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.960
You are the first person
I came to for help.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.080
Well, Abhay...

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.160
Your father might have been
a gentleman...

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.999
But I won't be able to lend money
without any mortgage.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.200
I would never propose such a thing.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.000
Here you go.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.440
This is the deed of my house.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.960
I hope you won't have
any issues now.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.240
Actually, occupational hazard.
Please don't mind.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.800
- When will you return the money?
- Within a month.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.680
<i>Forget about a month...</i>

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.200
It's been over a year.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.080
Bishu Pal couldn't retrieve his money.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.800
Meanwhile, Abhay Ghoshal disappeared.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.160
Three months ago...

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.920
<i>Abhay resurfaced.</i>

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.560
<i>He was looting rice
from various godowns.</i>

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.800
<i>One day, he raided
Bishu Pal's godown.</i>

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.680
<i>Bishu Pal rushed there.</i>

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.840
- Carefully.
- Come on, lift that.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.559
- Hey!
- They're coming, run!

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.719
- Hey!
- Run, run, run!

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.119
Hey, catch them.
Get him!

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.960
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.879
Come on, you bastard!
Come on.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.440
- Move, you bastard!
- Stealing rice! The nerve!

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.840
I can get you arrested for stealing rice
for the black market from my godown.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.080
Return my money.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.800
Or else I'll be compelled
to seize your house.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
You can't to do anything.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.279
That document is fake.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.800
- It's a duplicate.
- You cheat!

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.640
Return my money.
Give it back right now.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.280
You won't get a penny back.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.080
And if you ask for money again...
I'll kill you.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.919
<i>That did it!</i>

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.040
<i>Bishu Pal had a stroke
right after that.</i>

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.760
Then, the paralysis...
restricted him to the bed...

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.520
He became an invalid.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.480
Any threat to his life?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.640
No... That isn't there.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.679
He's out of it with great effort.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.720
But he fears Abhay Ghoshal will
definitely murder him.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.320
Even if he waives off the loan.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.479
That's why I've come to you, Byomkesh.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.079
To request you give him
some counsel.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.879
- Well, Suresh...
- Then it would be great...

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.879
If someone is bent on killing Shishu Pal,
then even Lord Shiva can't stop it.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.319
Oh, Byomkesh!
This gentleman is relying upon you...

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.279
No, I'll go.
I'll go, I'll go.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.160
It's good to know a money lender
right now, isn't it?

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.159
- Thank you, Byomkesh.
- Hmm.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.359
- Thank you, Ajit.
- Hmm.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.079
- Then I'll take your leave.
- Yes.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.639
Here's our address.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.040
You can keep this.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.599
And if you could tell me
when you'll be able to come...

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.000
I'll be there today.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.440
Oh, wow!
That's great.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.920
If you could tell me what time...

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.799
Four o'clock this afternoon?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.400
- Four o'clock?
- Hmm.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.679
Oh, no. I'll be there at six.
At six.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.600
Six o'clock?
That'll be perfect.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.039
Okay, then we'll meet later today.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.439
- Goodbye, Byomkesh.
- Goodbye.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. This way.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.720
New case?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.999
Yeah, something to do
with paralysis...

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.080
Good... You can focus on work now.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.640
No, I don't any much interest
in this case.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.360
I'm curious about is Rameshwar.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.919
Haven't met the man
in a long time, you know.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.639
- I'll pay him a visit, what say?
- Sure, go.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.480
Ajit, we're going out.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.440
- What are you thinking about?
- No. Nothing important.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.120
- Hey, move aside.
- Hmm.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.840
How can I help you?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.119
Greetings, I'm Byomkesh Bakshi
and this is my friend, Ajit Bandhyopadhyay.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.240
We'd like to meet Rameshwar.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.799
- There's nothing to worry about right now.
- Hmm.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.999
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.240
- And the medicine for night?
- I'll send you the prescription.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.840
- Okay... I'll call you.
- Yes.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.279
Perhaps you can't recognise me.
I am Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.400
I'd like to meet your father.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.440
Byomkesh...

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.360
Of course, I can recognise you...

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.360
- Yesterday, Father had a heart attack...
- Okay...

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.360
- He's fine now.
- Okay.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.000
- Could we meet him once?
- You want to meet him?

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.320
Okay, come upstairs.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040
Uh...

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.160
He's not well...
He's sleeping now.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.319
Some other day...

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.120
Got it.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.839
So, what's the name of the doctor?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.880
He's... Asim Sen.
Very famous doctor.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.039
Asim Sen... Oh, his dispensary is
on Vivekananda Road, right?

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.960
Yes, that's him.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.040
Goodbye.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.520
Not possible to meet Rameshwar at all?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.120
We don't have
the doctor's permission, actually.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.120
It's been exhausting for him.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.960
Has Rameshwar been ill
for a long time?

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.080
No, his health was mostly fine.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.680
He's quite old now,
so he doesn't leave his room much.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.880
He wrote many letters last night.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.520
God knows to whom...

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.280
Then suddenly at night...

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.000
Icing on the cake!

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.599
- We'll leave now. Goodbye.
- Yes, goodbye.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.040
Goodbye.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.320
Let's go, Ajit.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.960
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.319
He's like Dasaratha
from 'The Ramayana'.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.480
And the woman is
as shrewd as Kaikeyi!

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.200
Where to now?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.600
- To Asim Sen's chamber.
- Hmm.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.760
I'm Rameshwar's family friend.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.600
I've known him for 30 years.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.640
His heart has grown weak
with age.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.440
We had some minor health problems recently.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.680
But suddenly yesterday,
things got worse.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.960
Anyway, he's fine now.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.680
So, there's no immediate death scare.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.639
I can't vouch for that.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.000
A patient like him can live
another two years...

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.200
Or he might have a second attack
today.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.880
So, Dr. Sen...

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.200
Do you feel Rameshwar is
being cared for properly in that house?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.480
I felt that Kusheshwar and his wife...

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.720
are not allowing anyone
to go near Rameshwar.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.960
You don't know
Rameshwar's family well, do you?

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.560
Strange family!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.160
<i>Lavanya runs the household.</i>

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.400
<i>There are no servants
in the house.</i>

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.960
<i>She's just kept a deaf and dumb cook
because she can't cook herself.</i>

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.160
Give me the market ledger.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.920
What's wrong?
Give me the market ledger.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.600
Damn it!

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.240
- Give me the market ledger.
- Huh?

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.600
Onions... ginger... tomatoes...

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.000
<i>Lavanya does all other work herself.</i>

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.280
I see but why?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.599
I believe Nalini is at the core
of it all.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.559
- Nalini? Rameshwar's daughter?
- Hmm.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.599
Okay...

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.999
I'm sure you know that Kusheshwar
and Nalini are...

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.896
- Rameshwar's children from his first wife.
- First wife, yes. I know that.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.960
But perhaps you don't know...

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.760
that Nalini wanted to marry a guy
against her family's wishes.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.320
Really?
Oh...

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.520
<i>See what your daughter's been
up to, Father.</i>

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.600
How can some random guy be
the son-in-law of the Ray family?

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.280
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.640
That's right...

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.759
So, what does the guy's father do?

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.039
He was part of the Swadeshi Movement.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.000
He was shot dead by the police.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.719
What a disaster!

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.679
Is the son
part of the Swadeshi Movement too?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.520
Yes, he is.
He's been to prison twice.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.320
Will you still stay silent, Father?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.240
Listen dear, I love you very much.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.640
I don't want you
to have a hard life.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.520
Father, are you against this marriage?

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.040
But Nalini married Debnath
against her family's wishes.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.760
Rameshwar's anger died
in a few days.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.479
But Lavanya's anger did not subside.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.440
<i>You've married
against this family's wishes.</i>

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.640
There's no place for you
in this house anymore.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.600
You may leave.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.080
<i>Lavanya prevented Nalini
from meeting her father.</i>

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.079
<i>That's not my concern.</i>

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.799
You've done enough, now leave.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.799
This is your final payment.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.999
I need only one domestic help.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.079
<i>In case, Rameshwar tries to contact
his daughter through the servants...</i>

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.200
<i>she fired everyone.</i>

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.160
Rameshwar is under surveillance
in his own house.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.840
But there's no negligence
in his care.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.920
<i>So...</i>

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.760
Doctor, Rameshwar has made a will.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.519
How did you...

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.239
He wrote about it in his letter,
that's how.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.759
But I wanted to ask you
if that's true.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.199
Yes, it's true.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.319
I believe he's made a will
and given Nalini a part of his property.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.440
How did you know that?

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.600
Rameshwar had a heart attack
last night.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.200
An hour after that...
when he was slightly better...

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.400
- Doctor.
- Hmm?

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.000
I've made a will.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.999
When I die...
Please send word to Nalini.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.280
Doctor?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.520
Hope you'll have dinner with us.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.480
So it's clear that they don't want
Rameshwar to make a will.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.839
- Hmm.
- If Rameshwar makes a will then...

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.359
they'll have to share the property
with Nalini.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.880
Yes, if he dies without a will...

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.759
the son will inherit the entire property
as the natural heir.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.479
The daughter will get nothing.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.360
Dr. Sen, who is Rameshwar's lawyer?

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.320
I don't know if he has one...

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.640
(radio playing)

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:08.720
Byomkesh, how did you know Rameshwar
has made a will from his letter?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.000
Hmm?

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.880
What was in the letter?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.800
It was...

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.480
Rameshwar's poem.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.200
- The poem?
- That's a riddle.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.879
"Sing praises of Paramahansa,
by dividing into two his name...

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.160
Beauty belongs to the second part
and God, the first does claim."

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.600
And Rameshwar was reading
'Krishnakanta's Will'.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.919
It's very simple.
Solve it yourselves.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.640
What?

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.520
Madam... some rice gruel please.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.680
Please, madam...

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.360
Eat up, dear.
Have it.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.919
<i>"Have you seen a strange creature
on the city streets?</i>

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.199
<i>Excatly like humans.</i>

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.199
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.639
<i>As if they're carricatures, satires
or distortions.</i>

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.399
<i>Yet, they move and talk.</i>

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.800
<i>And accumulate on the streets
like garbage.</i>

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.079
<i>They sit sluggishly over
the mounds of leftovers</i>

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.960
<i>And beg for rice gruel."</i>

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.120
- Written by Premenandra Mitra.
- Hmm.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.920
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:25:44.921 --> 00:25:47.480
Good evening, Byomkesh.
Please come in.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.200
- Hmm, let's go.
- Byomkesh? Please come in.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.040
Come this way.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.720
- Hey, watch your step!
- Be careful.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.080
Carefully...

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.000
Please come.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.680
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.840
Sit... they're with me.
Sit down.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.640
Come in.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.360
This is Bishu's office.
Huge business.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.320
Actually, he is in business
with many wealthy men.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.560
- Please come.
- How old is his business?

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.040
Uh, I guess around 25 years...
I'm not quite sure...

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.680
Please come.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.480
Coming!

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.400
Who is it?

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:44.640
I'm Dr. Rakshit.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.120
Please open the door.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.560
Please come in.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.720
Byomkesh is here.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.480
Come on in, Byomkesh.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.280
Come in, Ajit.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.239
In here.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.560
Please switch on the light, dear.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.200
Welcome, Byomkesh.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.240
Thank my lucky stars
that you're here, Byomkesh.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.200
Please take a seat.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.040
Go ahead.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.080
I should have visted you myself.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.680
But you can see my condition.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.719
Byomkesh...

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.400
Doc must have told you everything.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.920
Hmm.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.120
Abhay Ghoshal is wasting away
his father's property.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.000
And I came to know...

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.720
that Abhay Ghoshal...

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.760
has murdered a notorious merchant
called Sambhunath Kundu.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.480
He was acquitted
due to lack of evidence.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:17.440
His name had come up
for the murder of another man but...

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.320
There was no proof.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.040
Why did you let Abhay Ghoshal go
when you caught him?

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.560
Out of fear, Byomkesh.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.400
Have you seen Abhay's eyes?

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.399
<i>And the man who has been acquitted
after committing murder...</i>

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.480
<i>feels encouraged.</i>

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360
<i>Then, I...</i>

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.080
had a stroke
and my legs became numb.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.680
Although, Suresh brought
a famous doctor...

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.560
But even he couldn't do much.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.320
Doctors are hopeful I won't die
but will I stay alive?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.120
Abhay Ghoshal won't spare me, Byomkesh.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.360
- Here you go.
- Tea.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.240
Who runs the kitchen in your house?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.600
There was a cook.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.360
We got rid of him.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.360
Who looks after the business?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.000
They work in the office.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.800
If it's very important,
they come up and ask me.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.560
But I don't let them enter.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.360
So, the only outsider...

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.320
Who can enter your room
is Dr. Rakshit.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.440
Yes.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.720
Well, Bishu...

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.200
You've done everything
you had to do.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.320
I can't think of anything else
I can do.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.920
Actually...

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.480
Since you're scared
you're worrying too much.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.880
No.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.120
It's not just that.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.280
- Yesterday this...
- I'll get it.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.560
Byomkesh...

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.920
Please read it.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.560
Rameshwar Ray?

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.200
I've known Rameshwar a long time.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.320
He's like an elder brother to me.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.000
We haven't met
in a long time but...

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.320
He writes to me twice a year.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.560
For New Year and the Durga festival?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.399
Yes, but how did you...

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.519
I know him too.
Writes to me on those same two occasions.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.919
Oh.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.480
- I'm reading the letter.
- Yes, please read.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.240
Dear brother, Shishu Pal?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.680
Rameshwar has always called me
Shishu Pal.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.840
<i>Wish you a happy New Year.</i>

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.839
<i>Of late, quite often...</i>

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:38.480
<i>I see very big men
hovering around me.</i>

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.880
<i>In their hands, is my ticket
to go across to the other world.</i>

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.520
<i>I get news of your activities
from my son.</i>

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.839
<i>My son has become
an ardent follower of yours.</i>

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.079
<i>My daughter-in-law
is quite fond of you too.</i>

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.479
"I've arranged for my son's fee to you
through the truth-seeker, Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.799
I'll find out if you've received it
from my heavenly abode.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.559
May God make you fearless
in your journey.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.040
Yours, Rameshwar Ray."

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.840
Rameshwar loves talking in riddles.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.760
Could you make any sense
of this letter?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.799
No.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.039
I received a letter with riddles too...

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.600
Why is Rameshwar's son
your ardent follower?

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.760
Kusheshwar has always loved me.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.240
And Kusheshwar is looking
into Rameshwar's business now.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.240
A few days ago, he had come
to me for some business advice.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.479
<i>He had taken my advice.</i>

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.399
<i>And it had resulted in success.</i>

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:44.880
Okay.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.920
The letter mentions you, Byomkesh.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.560
Moreover, the last line made me
feel quite uneasy.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.319
"May God make you fearless
in your journey."

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.400
This line?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.320
Yes.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.400
God has really sent me an 'Abhay'
meaning fearless.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.800
Bishu...

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.159
Do you feel Rameshwar Ray
is behind Abhay Ghoshal?

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:18.280
Do you have any old, secret enmity
with Rameshwar?

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040
No.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.799
I feel you're very scared...

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.079
So despite having nothing to be afraid of,
you're fearing the worst.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.160
Yes, that's possible.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.960
You can see the condition I'm in.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.479
I want you to go
to Rameshwar's house...

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.880
and find out what he exactly meant.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.400
Alright, then.
I'll take my leave.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.320
Wait a minute, Byomkesh.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.960
What's this?
I mean, there's no need.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.000
Just an honorarium.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.960
You wasted your precious time.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.320
- Let's go, Ajit.
- Goodbye.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.040
- Wait, Ajit.
- What happened?

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.520
Are you always on guard here?

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.920
No, no.
He's not always here.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.000
I mean, there are two guards.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.039
He's here from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.360
And the other guard is here
from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.440
There are two guards.

00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:38.759
Who is on guard
when they're not around?

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.119
I'm on guard.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.599
- I want to see your chamber.
- Huh?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.199
- Your chamber.
- Chamber.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.519
- Yes, yes, please come.
- Goodbye.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.440
Watch your step.
Be careful.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.200
Come in, Ajit.
Please come, Byomkesh.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.119
Is this your room?

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.719
- No, this is the chamber.
- Oh.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.760
- The living arrangements are at the back.
- Hmm.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.760
Wow!

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.840
You've decorated the chamber quite well.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.520
Well, a shabby look
won't earn me money!

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.039
So, I have to deck it up
for my patients.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.639
How long have you been
in the practice?

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.600
It's been around six months
since I came to Kolkata.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.199
Before that I was at Tamluk.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.320
Oh, you must have shifted here
after the cyclone, right?

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:45.400
- Yes, the condition there...
- Is terrible.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.319
You know...

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.360
I heard that...

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.679
Before doling out the relief supplies,
the Midnapore judge

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.199
made the villagers sign a declaration...

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.079
that no one would protest
against the government.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.800
Is it true?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.479
I'm not quite sure.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.120
I didn't stay updated with the news.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.240
Oh, so you don't look back.
Good.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.199
I beg your pardon?

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.720
You have quite a collection here.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.919
I'm getting by.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.640
Hmph!

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.080
Dr. Rakshit, what do you think...

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:35.200
Is Bishu Pal's fear of death a sign
of mental illness?

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.839
Well Byomkesh, when one is so rich...

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.800
it's not strange that he'll be afraid.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.560
But I don't think Bishu Pal's fear
is entirely psychological.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.039
Abhay Ghoshal had poisoned
his own father.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.359
Or so I've heard.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.120
Although there's no proof.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:08.840
And the smuggling of rice
from various godowns at night...

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.120
I've heard Abhay Ghoshal is linked
with the black market too.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.880
This is also hearsay?
There's no proof?

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.000
- Uh...
- What a strange man!

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.639
He's committing one crime after another
but there's no proof...

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.120
No one gets to know or understand...
No one can catch him...

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.279
- I'm tempted to meet such a man, Ajit!
- Hmm.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.280
Suresh, do you know his address?

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.640
- Fraud! You only care about your business!
- Stop it!

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.879
- You're a fraud! I'm no longer with you.
- You're talking rubbish.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.960
Debnath, listen to me.
Debnath, hear me out. Debnath!

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.080
- What's the matter?
- You must be Abhay Ghoshal.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.559
- Yes.
- Good evening. I'm Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.920
I need to talk to you.
Ajit, sit down.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.640
Who set a detective after me?
Shishu Pal?

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.560
I heard about you from him.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.400
I'm sure you know that
Bishu Pal's legs are paralysed.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.480
Really?

00:38:25.481 --> 00:38:27.960
God is doing his duty
even in this famine?

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.560
He can't leave the house, Abhay.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.600
It's not only his legs
but also his fear of you.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.960
Really?

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.960
Shishu Pal is the creditor
and I am his debtor.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.800
- I should be hiding from him...
- He believes you want to kill him.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.000
Do you really want
to kill Bishu Pal, Abhay?

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.200
The lizard asks the mosquito
if it wants blood!

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.640
What should be my reply, Byomkesh?

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.520
At least, you admit you're a mosquito!

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.000
Yes.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.760
But I know who
to suck blood out of.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:18.000
What's your opinion about the black market
during the famine?

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.239
The Civil Supply Department
is breaking into locked godowns...

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.280
and seizing rice, wheat,
oil, salt, kerosene, all of it.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.080
Is this how you'll stop black marketing?

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.000
You won't be able to do it.
Never.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.719
The merchants who were selling rice
at the markets...

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.399
They' ve completely lost faith
in the government.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.639
- Black marketing will increase, Byomkesh.
- Really?

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.759
What about the poor villagers
coming to Kolkata for some rice?

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.960
Does that affect your class
of people?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.680
It doesn't, does it?
It won't affect you.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.480
So, don't show fake concern
to become a hero, Mr. Lizard!

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.040
Goodbye.
Please leave.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.999
Do you have a cigarette, Mr. Snake?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.040
What's wrong with you, Byomkesh?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.319
It's because of these people
that there's famine in Bengal today, Ajit.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.360
History will not forgive them.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.480
- What happened now?
- Come on, faster!

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.560
- Was there anyone inside the carriage?
- I didn't notice.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.560
Do you think someone's following us?

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.560
It's possible.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.119
Who could it be?

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.240
That's a long list.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.559
It's done.
Come out now.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.480
Hey!
Come on, get out.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.840
What happened?

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.400
Here, have some water.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.400
You had a nightmare.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.760
Lie down.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.840
People are dying, Satyabati.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.720
Just because of some vultures
disguised as humans.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.040
And we can do nothing...
Can't do a thing about it.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.600
- We can't do anything.
- Calm down.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.040
Nothing!
