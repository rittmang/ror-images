00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920
The Pakistan Airlines tragedy.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.320
The plane crash in the Bay of Bengal--

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.200
Hello, Dum Dum Airport?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
I am Byomkesh Bakshi.
Can I speak to Mrigen Dutta?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.320
Sure, I'll hold.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.840
Hello, Mrigen.
Byomkesh here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.080
I'm fine. How are you?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.560
The Pakistan Airlines tragedy from
a few days ago?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.520
Yes, the one that crashed into the sea.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.640
I wanted to know the details
about the victims.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.800
So all the officers were Muslim?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.200
The pilot?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.160
English.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.440
The navigator?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.600
Pakistani.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.360
Mrigen, can I get a complete list
of the victims?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.520
Yes, I'll pick it up tomorrow.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.680
Very well.
Thank you very much.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.240
Goodbye.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.560
What's going on?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.280
Huh?
What?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.040
What's the matter?

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.040
-What?
-There you have it!

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.200
He's asking me!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.280
-Ajit.
-What?

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.440
-We need a disguise.
-Huh?

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.680
Dry fruits!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.400
Peanuts!

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.400
Dry fruits!

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.360
Raisins!

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.000
Cashew nuts!

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.280
Dry fruits--

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.520
Do you want some dry fruits, son?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.200
It's useless to spy on me, Ajit.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.920
Tell your friend...

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.360
If I killed Henna,
then fine.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.800
You won't be able to do anything
against me.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.160
You didn't learn anything
fro me in all these years.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.080
-How did he know it's you?
-He's very cunning.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.640
Moreover, I'm neither a politician
nor an actor. I'm a writer.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.560
-Why do you always--
-Don't lie.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.760
-What do you mean?
-When you publish this case as a story...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.680
and you skip out how bad you messed up,
just see what I do to you!

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.960
Hey--

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.120
Uff!

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.160
Got you--
Hey Chingri!

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.440
Hey!

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.720
Hey, hang on!

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.760
-No! No!
-Wait up!

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.520
-No!
-Hey!

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.800
The brothers seem
to be friends now, huh?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.640
Such is youth.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.080
-Please come, Byomkesh.
-Hello, Nengti.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.800
-Why the urgent call?
-Aunty has called for you.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.640
Come.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.360
Please sit down.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.400
You too.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.680
No, I haven't finished praying yet.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.200
Chameli, please don't get
unnecessarily excited.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.400
Santosh has hired me to protect
the interests of this family.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.480
If you know anything about Henna's death,
please tell me everything clearly.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.760
Why has the police sent spies
after my sons?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.400
My sons are completely innocent.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.560
The police are investigating to prove
that your sons are innocent.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.200
When I'm saying they're innocent,
why aren't the police believing me?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400
You're their mother, Chameli.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.600
It's natural for you to think
that your sons are innocent but...

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.760
everyone is an equal suspect
for the police.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.080
Byomkesh.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.120
I know how Henna died.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.280
<i>That day...</i>

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.760
<i>I left the room
when Chingri went to the washroom.</i>

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.920
Why are you after my sons?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.720
You've already brainwashed my husband.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.040
You won't spare my sons either, huh?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.640
You better leave this house
this very day.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.720
What's the matter?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.520
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.080
Can't you hear me?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.520
Why didn't you tell me before?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.840
Would anyone believe me if I did?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.920
Chameli, when you went
to the terrace that day...

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.840
did you see Uday near the stairs
or in the hall or anywhere at all?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.280
Uday?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.760
No, I didn't.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.720
Did you see anyone else
when you were in the hall?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.400
<i>Ravi Verma.</i>

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.040
I saw Uday.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.680
<i>Anyone else?</i>

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.640
Give me a smoke.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.000
Yes, Uday.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.400
Did you see anyone else?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.560
-I didn't notice.
-Ch--

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.640
Chameli, you're inviting more trouble
for your sons by trying to protect them.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.680
I promise you.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.000
If your sons really are innocent...

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.240
it's my responsibility to protect them.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.800
Goodbye.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.360
"This world is a giant slaughterhouse.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400
With every blink of the eye,
a million creatures shut their eyes forever.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.040
Who is the game master?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.080
The earth's soil is tainted with murder."

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.320
Raghupati from Tagore's "Bisarjan"?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.760
My goodness!

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.440
What are you up to?
You're unwell.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.640
Trying to get well.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.920
Hey, don't--
Look at you!

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.760
Careful, Byomkesh.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.080
Byomkesh! Watch your step!

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.640
Be careful, watch your step.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.440
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.600
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.840
<i>Because of him</i>

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.600
Uff!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.560
<i>My sky is full of stars at night</i>

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.680
<i>Flowers bloom in the morn
</i>

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.680
<i>In the forest</i>

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.640
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.280
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.400
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.400
Careful, careful!

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.040
Easy there.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.800
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.200
What did you see?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.200
Nothing special.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.800
The real spectacle is over there.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.960
What's this?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.080
You can enter the house
from here as well?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.600
So what do you figure?

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.800
Just that someone can enter secretly,
go up the scaffolding...

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.080
Yes! Someone can easily go to the terrace
with this ladder.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.680
Bravo!

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.000
-Come on.
-Hmm.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.360
Here.
A letter for you.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.920
What happened at the Samaddars'?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.760
Everyone is lying.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.360
Complete bluff.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.520
I don't get why you even care.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.840
I can't rest till I know the truth.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.880
What's this about?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.160
A letter from the Government of Odisha.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.320
Asking me to investigate a case
of missing files from their office.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.400
Apparently, if I don't take it up
the state will be in grave danger.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.360
They've sent some advance.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.200
Thank God!

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.280
It's been so long
since we went on a trip.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.480
Let's all go somewhere.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.080
The Rath festival is coming up.
Let us all go to Puri and enjoy it.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.680
Selling one's art is just as important
as enjoyment, Satya.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.480
Huh. Since when do you sell your art?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.720
Why?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.520
Art doesn't just mean music, acting
and sculpting, right?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.240
Seeking the truth is an art too.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.080
And our family runs on that money.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.320
I have to go out at night.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.760
For what?

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.520
In search of the Sun in the night sky.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.640
Has your husband lost it?
Huh?

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.840
Going in search of the Sun
in the night sky?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.520
What's another word for the sun?
Think.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.160
INDOPAK HOTEL

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.880
-Here it is, sir.
-Hmm.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.240
We found a bag
next to Henna's mat on the terrace.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.960
And it had these keys.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.320
Huh?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.720
What?

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.800
What's all this?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.680
What's wrong?
What's the significance of seven?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.760
Hey, listen!

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.040
-AK Ray?
-What happened to you?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.440
You have the keys
from Henna's bag, right?

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.000
-Yes.
-Give it to me! It's very important.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.880
-I think we'll solve this case tonight.
-Here you go.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.400
-Let's go, Ajit.
-Yes.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.320
-Can I come along?
-What?

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.280
The police has closed the case.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.040
Not as a police officer, my friend,
as a friend.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.000
-Let's go.
-Let's.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.280
Sir.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.280
Please come.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.640
I've heard that alcohol is sold illegally
at your hotel, Mr. Manager.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.960
Not at all.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.080
Oh really?

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, that can be cleared up
at the police station.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.200
Come to the police station with us.
There's a warrant in your name.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.360
Oh, come on, sir!

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.520
Wouldn't it be better
if we settled the matter inside, sir?

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.160
-Sure?
-Yes.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.080
Wait here.
I'll have a word with him inside.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.800
Don't move.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.080
-Come on.
-This way, sir.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.040
RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.600
Yes.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.560
-Sit down, gentleman. Please sit.
-Sit down, Ajit.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.440
If you don't have a drink
at this poor man's house...

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.080
 it'll bring me back luck, sir.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.920
-Not today.
-Why not?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.000
Oh, sir!

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.800
I won't find a place even in Hell
if I can't quench a guest's thirst.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.240
Don't worry, the God of Death
has bought more land to add to Hell!

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.480
-Really? Where?
-In this very country.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.160
-Tell me something.
-Yes.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.440
Who stays in room number seven?

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.000
Room seven... room seven--

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.080
Room number seven has been rented
by a Pakistani man.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.000
A very amusing man!

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.320
He rents it from time to time
but stays only for three or four days.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.960
That too just for half an hour.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.360
-Is he accompanied by anyone?
-Hmm.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.920
An angel!

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.680
What's this man's name?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.280
Name? His name...

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.440
Can't remember who you rented it to?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.360
His name was--

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.440
Ah! The register!
It's in the register.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.080
-Okay, wait, you sit.
-Sit down, sit down.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.960
This, right?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.560
-There, that one.
-This one?

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.280
Room number seven...

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.920
Dhaka, Pakistan, Omor Siraji.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.200
-Okay?
-Omor Siraji?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.160
Omor Siraji or that angel...

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.560
has anyone else come with them?

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.880
Or has anyone ever come
in their absence?

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.760
I don't know that, sir, but...

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.440
Another man had come
about 10 or 12 days ago.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.360
What's going on?

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.240
I'm the Officer in Charge here.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.280
I've never seen you before.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.960
-I've just been posted here.
-Oh.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.120
I know some secrets
about this hotel of yours.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.360
Like?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.000
Illegal activities are carried out
in room number seven.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.920
Give me the keys to the room.
I'll search it.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.280
Give it to me.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.640
What's the matter?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.080
Do you have a warrant?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.440
Show me.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.480
I could take you to the police station
right now.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.120
I'm sure you know that.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.800
I run a hotel in the city, sir.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.960
I know a little bit of the law too.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.840
Get a warrant first.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.680
Then you can search.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.560
I'm not going anywhere
neither is room number seven.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.280
Go.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.640
Such things...

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.360
Such things often happens at hotels, sir.
I'm used to it.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.960
If you could give a physical description...

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.400
He was in a costume.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.520
-In a costume?
-Yes.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.920
-What costume?
-Why do you care?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.000
Dressed as a circus lion!
Satisfied?

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040
-Oh?
-Let's go.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.840
-Okay.
-Come, AK Ray.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.920
Let's go.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.680
-Visit again, sir.
-Goodbye.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.520
-Goodbye!
-Please come again.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.600
-Satyabati!
-Coming!

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.080
What is it, Ajit?

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.280
You've heard of Omar Khayyam
but have you heard of Omar Siraji?

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.760
-Omor Siraji?
-Hmm.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.160
Who's that?

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.160
The navigator who died in the
Pakistan Airlines tragedy was Omor Siraji.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.440
Please don't disturb me tonight.
Have dinner.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.840
-I won't eat.
-Huh?

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.080
Fine.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.880
-Come to eat, Ajit.
-Can I--

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.080
<i>His words</i>

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.200
<i>Rise up suddenly</i>

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.880
<i>Amidst a forgotten melody</i>

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.360
<i>In the tunes of my song</i>

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.480
<i>His words...</i>

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.440
<i>Sways me in melancholy</i>

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:31.240
<i>In melancholy...</i>

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.960
YOURS,
SANTOSH

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.880
<i>He hides in my work
to distract me</i>

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
<i>Because he is mine forever</i>

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:56.760
<i>He gives my heart wings</i>

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.320
Could you unearth the truth?

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.880
How can the truth evade me
with you by my side?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.840
Who's the mystery man?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.960
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.760
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.120
Hello, Santosh.
I need to talk to you.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.040
Yes, tell me.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.840
Let me start by apologising...

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.680
for continuing the investigation
despite all your efforts.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.800
I'm very sorry about that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.040
-What are you implying?
-You don't get it?

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.480
Very well.
I'll explain.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.000
First, you hired goons to injure me
so that I stop my investigation.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.360
When that failed, you requested
the Odisha government...

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.960
to call me for some investigation.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.680
Used money as bait.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.120
But Byomkesh Bakshi never leaves
an investigation incomplete, Santosh.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.440
Why are you here?

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.760
To tell you who murdered Henna Mullick.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.720
Who?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.960
You.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.360
Hmmph!

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.000
-Can you prove it?
-No.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.560
But I can prove that you had motive
to murder her.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.000
I will file a defamation case against you.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.360
You won't be able to.
You don't have the guts.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.840
You used your influence
to close the police investigation

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.360
but everyone needs to know the truth.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.720
What do you mean?

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.040
What nonsense is this?
What truth?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.880
About where your lifeline
is hidden right now.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.800
That which you didn't find
in Henna's room.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.880
The reason why you set fire
to the documents in her room.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.480
Your precious lifeline is now...

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.960
with me.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.480
What do you want?

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.920
How much money?

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.200
You're a traitor to your country, Santosh.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.360
You must be punished for it.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.360
Do you know who you're accusing?

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.400
I never accuse anyone
without proper evidence, Santosh.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.160
Henna Mullick's mother, Mina,
and you were lovers.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.360
You would regularly go to Dhaka
during the Partition.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.760
You knew...

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.960
that Mina was a Pakistani spy .

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.680
Despite it, you used to convey
information of your party to Mina.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.600
You shared all the secret tricks
and strategies with her.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.760
There has been rioting
because of that.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.160
Lakhs of people have lost their lives.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.680
After Mina's death...

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.360
<i>that letter reached her daughter,
Henna Mullick.</i>

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.400
<i>Henna Mullick and Omor Siraji decided
to blackmail you.</i>

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.000
<i>And as per the plan,
Henna kept blackmailing you.</i>

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.560
One lakh rupees.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.440
Give me the letters.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.320
You can't shut up a truth seeker
with money, Santosh.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.480
Because leaders like you
and your disgusting, selfish wants...

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.520
the curse of the partition has befallen us.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.440
And millions innocent people of India
and Pakistan have had to pay for it.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.000
They will in future too.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.880
Their curses won't be in vain, Santosh.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.280
From tomorrow, your letters will be
published one by one in the newspapers.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.520
Be ready.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.240
We'd have lost much more
if it wasn't for the Partition. Believe--

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.120
No, I don't believe you!

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.560
I don't believe you!

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.480
This is something you made up.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.360
A distorted history you'll tell
the future generations...

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.840
To create a rift between people,
to spread communal poison...

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.480
year after year, decade after decade!

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.560
And millions more will die
because of this, Santosh.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.280
Everyone needs to know the truth
about people like you.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.400
Will you please give me one day?

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.960
Very well.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.160
Your letters won't be published
in tomorrow's newspaper.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.640
But there's no point
sending goons to kill me, Santosh.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.200
Even if I get killed, you'll never find
those letters.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.960
Let's go, Ajit.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.480
"There's nothing either good or bad...

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.520
but thinking makes it so."

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.720
"Famous politician and businessman
Santosh Samaddar commits suicide."

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.200
What a tragedy!

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.760
There's an English proverb...

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.120
A sailor has a girl in every port.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.240
It was the same with Santosh.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.960
I believe that he had a lover
in every city.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.480
Sukumari in Kolkata,
Mina in Dhaka.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.160
I believe Mina's husband,
Kamal Mullick, was a simple man.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.520
And we've seen Mina's photo.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.120
<i>She was beautiful just like Henna.</i>

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.160
On top of that, she socialised
with the big shots of society.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.400
Then came the Partition.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.520
Santosh was one of the
top politicians then.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.520
He was serving as the national messenger
between India and Pakistan.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.640
Naturally, he had to frequent Dhaka.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.240
That's where he met Mina
and fell in love.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.680
She took the opportunity to lay hands on
our country's secret documents.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.320
Santosh was so madly in love
that he disclosed vital information...

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.000
<i>in his letters to Mina.</i>

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.800
Despite knowing
that Mina is a Pakistani spy.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.960
BELOVED MINA "MATAHARI"
SANTOSH SAMADDAR

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.120
<i>I found this priceless piece of evidence
while searching that hotel room.</i>

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.640
Santosh tried looking for the letters
but he had no way.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.800
<i>Henna would be in her room all day.</i>

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.760
<i>When she went to the terrace to pray,
she locked her room.</i>

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.800
Hmm...

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.200
Sit.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.600
<i>Santosh used to give some money
to Henna every week.</i>

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.160
Hmm.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.720
Hmm?

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.600
<i>Henna used to hand it over
to Omor Siraji.</i>

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.320
Henna's friend, Omor Siraji,
worked for the Airlines.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.640
He came to meet Henna every 10 or 12 days.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.840
<i>Omor Siraji played the mouth organ
when he arrived...</i>

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.800
<i>And Henna used to go
to the hotel with him.</i>

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.480
<i>The hotel where Omor Siraji
had rented room number seven.</i>

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.400
INDOPAK
HOTEL

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.560
<i>They had hidden all their secret documents
in that room.</i>

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.480
<i>Henna used to give him the money
she got from Santosh.</i>

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.440
<i>Omor used to take it
and go straight to Pakistan.</i>

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.040
That Henna Mullick was not the
orphaned daughter of Santosh's friend ...

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.120
and that she and Omor Siraji were trying
to blackmail Santosh...

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.960
Ravi Verma was the first to suspect this.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.800
INDOPAK
HOTEL

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.400
<i>Hello?</i>

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.840
<i>Hello, Operator?</i>

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.320
<i>Hello?</i>

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.200
<i>Uff! Hello?</i>

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.440
What's wrong with this?
Hello?

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.120
<i>He followed Henna
to room number seven.</i>

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.880
<i>But he could not unlock it.</i>

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.160
<i>Hence, he tried different methods.</i>

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.760
<i>First, he tried to unlock it with a key.
Didn't work.</i>

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.400
<i>Tried threatening the manager
dressed as a police officer.</i>

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.320
<i>That didn't work either.</i>

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.280
-What is it?
-I am the Officer in Charge here.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.840
I've never seen you before.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.240
-I've just been posted here.
-Oh.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.280
<i>Then he bought a lock that like
that of room number seven...</i>

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.480
<i>and tried to unlock it with its key.</i>

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.720
<i>Still failed.</i>

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.240
<i>Byomkesh, it's possible...</i>

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.480
Maybe Santosh told Ravi Verma...

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.720
to extract those documents
from that hotel room?

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.800
Santosh wouldn't do it on the sly.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.200
He'd give a hefty bribe
to the hotel manager.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.800
So, Santosh's mental agony
dragged on for months.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.080
Then one day, Santosh read in the papers...

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.640
that Omor Siraji has died
in the airplane tragedy.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.840
But Henna didn't know that yet.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.080
<i>Santosh found a way out.</i>

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.720
<i>He realised that Omor Siraji is dead...</i>

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.840
<i>and he'll be at peace
if he could get rid of Henna.</i>

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.120
Henna went to the terrace
every day to pray.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.200
<i>The house was being repaired.</i>

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.760
There was scaffolding
from the ground to the terrace.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.400
I believe that he had
planned it from before.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.840
The only obstacle in his path
was Omor Siraji.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.480
He planned his alibi with Sukumari
on Saturday evening,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.560
<i>You see...</i>

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.840
I'll murder her in such a way...

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.440
that her death looks like an accident.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.600
You will be my alibi.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.800
The police might interrogate you
in different ways.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.480
You won't get scared, will you?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.680
I am relying on you heavily.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.240
I love you, sir.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.520
Hmm.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.280
Hmm.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.280
(song playing)

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.160
<i>Santosh entered through the back door,
went up the scaffolding...</i>

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.960
<i>and directly reached the terrace.</i>

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.360
(song playing)

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.360
<i>Santosh unlatched the terrace door.</i>

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.800
<i>The door remains open.</i>

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.760
<i>So if anyone suspects
that Henna had been murdered...</i>

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.440
<i>they won't be able to guess
which way the murderer entered from...</i>

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.960
<i>By climbing up the scaffolding
or from inside the house.</i>

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.440
<i>Santosh finished the job
and secretly went back to Sukumari.</i>

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.600
<i>No one at home had any idea.</i>

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.520
(song playing)

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.440
I'm sure Sukumari loved Santosh.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.520
That's why, she didn't mind
getting involved even in a murder.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.920
Sukumari is the probably only person
who's sad about Santosh's death.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.960
(song playing)

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.520
Hmm.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:18.800
After that, Santosh tried to destroy
all the documents in Henna's room, right?

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.080
Yes.
Destroyed everything.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.040
-Santosh planned it pretty well.
-Hmm.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.280
He did plan it well but he didn't realise
that I would investigate the case.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.800
Byomkesh.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.640
Why did Santosh appoint you
to protect his family honour?

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.440
He could have dismissed you
right from the beginning.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.920
First of all, Nengti had already called me
by that time.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.440
If he tried to get rid of me then,
everyone would suspect him.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.520
Secondly, people like him are very rich.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.160
They think they can buy off everyone.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.880
<i>He thought if he let me continue
without getting on my wrong side...</i>

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.720
then maybe I would find
all those secret documents...

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.120
and then he would bribe me
to give them to him.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.120
But when he realised that I'm hell bent
on catching Henna Mullick's murderer...

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.480
he tried to get rid of me.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.280
When did you suspect him?

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.000
After the fire in Henna Mullick's room.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.880
<i>What could he burn?</i>

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.120
Something you can't get easily.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.920
What could it be?

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.760
Some document...

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.000
some letter which can be used
to blackmail someone.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.840
But blackmail who?

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.240
Uday and Jugal can be counted out.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.720
The only ones left are
Santosh Samaddar and Ravi Verma.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.840
Ravi Verma doesn't have any money.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.320
How much could someone get
by blackmailing him?

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.600
On the other hand,
Santosh Samaddar is a rich man...

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.160
He frequents East Bengal...

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.720
He has given shelter to Henna Mullick
in his own house...

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.120
He used his influence
to close the police investigation...

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.000
Arranged to have me sent to Odisha...

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.200
So, he was the most suitable candidate.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.560
Hmm.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.880
What will you do with the letters?

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.600
What?

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.720
You burnt them all?

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.000
Won't you tell anyone else
that he's the murderer?

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.960
Santosh has repented for his deeds, Satya.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.640
There's no point endangering his family
by defaming him.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.120
Let the hidden mountain stay hidden.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.400
-Byomkesh.
-Uff!

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.360
-Nengti.
-What are you burning?

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.120
Uncle died.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.280
And you still couldn't figure out
who killed Henna.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.040
Some truth seeker!

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.960
You're right.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.880
These days, I doubt myself too.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.280
So, do you know
who murdered Henna, Nengti?

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.480
Hmm.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.160
I've known from the beginning.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.680
Who?

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.000
Uncle.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.000
How do you know?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.440
-I saw it myself.
-There you go!

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.760
<i>I went to the back of the house
to smoke.</i>

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.240
<i>I clearly saw it.</i>

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.320
Wow!

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.800
Brilliant!

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.720
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Why should I?

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.640
Uncle provides for me.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.960
I told you because he's no more.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.040
Moreover, you'd get paid
if you could solve it.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.080
Why should I help you for free?

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.720
Give me a smoke.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.360
What a brat!

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.760
Uff!
