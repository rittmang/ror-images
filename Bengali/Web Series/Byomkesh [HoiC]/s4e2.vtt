WEBVTT

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.200
Cracked the case yet?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.760
No...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.399
What are you reading, Ajit?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.440
Tell me.
I must distract myself.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.440
<i>A very interesting subject!</i>

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.720
Religion has turned
into a business...

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.960
According to Freud, behind every religion
there's a primordial murder.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.999
- Primordial murder?
- Hmm...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.960
The original murder...
What does that mean?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.960
Let me explain...

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.280
Suppose we belong to
a primitive barbarian tribe.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.560
There's a cruel father who wants
to expel his sons from the tribe.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.560
- Why?
- Because...

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.960
the father wants all the women
of that tribe for himself.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.599
I see.
And then?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.279
Then the children conspire against him
and murder the father.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.440
And to celebrate the success
they even consume their father's flesh.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.000
So, it's metaphor.
But what does it imply?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.639
It implies that...

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.039
according to Freud,
by consuming the father's flesh...

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.999
the sons imbibe the father's energy.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.879
Although they respect
their father...

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.079
they also consider him an enemy.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.079
They respect him for his strength.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.439
And despise him
for his violent, envious nature. Right?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.519
And by consuming that flesh...

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.479
all the brothers become one
with the father's energy.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.919
Now, this act of vengeance
makes them feel guilty.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.519
And to free themselves
of this guilt...

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.599
they worship the father
as the head of the tribe.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.079
As a godhead.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.520
That's how all religion began.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.799
All metaphors...

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.759
Freud meant that...

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.359
man uses religion as a way
to get rid of his guilt.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.399
Hmm.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.079
Different religion have created
different gods...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320
Freud thinks it's all primordial murder.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.440
A majestic symbol for the slain father.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.080
Metaphor... primordial murder...

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.080
The first murder...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.560
(bell rings)

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.360
Come in.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.720
My name is Manmatha Rudra.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.480
You must be Nontu?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.800
Do you know me?

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.679
Yes, I recently came
to know your name.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.800
Do you want to know
about Rekha's death?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.440
Yes...

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.599
- Did you find anything, Byomkesh?
- Nothing yet.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.000
Umm... what do you think?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.160
Did Rekha really commit suicide?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.000
Not possible.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.919
Then did someone...

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.120
You were in a relationship
with Rekha.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.279
But your father
was strictly against it.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.800
Believe me, I didn't accept
my father's decision.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.520
We had a huge fight over it.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.360
Who might benefit from Rekha's death?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.000
Your father...

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.640
My father?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080
No... no...

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.480
that can't be!

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.720
Why not?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.640
Huh?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.080
We know your father very well.
He has no regard for people.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.880
You might have a motive as well.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.240
What are you trying to say?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.239
I loved Rekha.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.399
Did you know
if Rekha had any enemies?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.000
You must know...
you're the closest to her.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.160
I don't know anyone.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.280
That means Rekha's only enemy
was your father.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.559
You know... feeding on the flesh...

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.640
Isn't it?

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.280
- Huh?
- No... no...

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.879
You're mistaken...

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.520
No... no... he wanted to...

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.039
Are you getting it?
Feeding on the flesh...

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.839
Sons want to consume
their father's flesh...

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.679
What are you saying?
You're wrong.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.159
Father can't do this!

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.520
Primordial murder...
The original murder...

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.760
Primordial murder...

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.840
I left Delhi at 10 a.m. yesterday.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.520
I reached here at 2:30 p.m. today.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.720
I spent 30 hours on the train.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.960
You've been a great help
in this time of crisis.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.560
That's our duty
as your neighbour, Debkumar.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.599
Listen...

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.440
What happened to my daughter?
Do you know?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.559
Nothing yet... but...

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.160
what Dr. Rudra said
after examining the body...

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.280
What?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.760
That filthy man stepped
inside my house?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.320
Demon... he's living demon...

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.640
I... I've to go now.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.320
To the morgue.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.160
I have to bring my daughter's body
from the morgue.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400
Byomkesh...

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.120
if I had money...

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.840
I would've appointed you
for the investigation.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.760
But I can't afford you.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.480
Afford me?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.800
I beg your pardon,
Debkumar but...

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.480
- The collection in your house...
- Inheritance...

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.240
I'm just a government employee.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.240
Fees are not always important.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.840
No...

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.960
I can't take anyone's help
without fees.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.360
Police...

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.240
Police are investigating.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.080
They'll do whatever they can.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.720
I won't get my daughter back.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.800
Have your tea before you leave.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.479
<i>- Byomkesh...
- Hmm?</i>

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.360
Did you notice Debkumar's rings?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.360
A scientist wearing gemstones.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.480
Hmm...

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.839
A misconception was corrected today.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.480
What?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.160
I thought Debkumar despised
his children from his first wife.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.079
I was wrong.
He loves them a lot.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.240
Yes... especially his daughter.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.320
- Byomkesh?
- Hmm?

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.760
The post mortem report?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.319
Good reminder.
It must have come by now.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.600
- Let's check it.
- Let's go.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.560
Hmm...

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.799
By Jove!
What an amazing death!

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.640
Doctors have failed to identify
the cause of death.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.920
Any scar on the body?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.800
No.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.280
Did they find any poison?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.200
No.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.840
- The heart?
- Normal.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.759
- When will the report come?
- Tomorrow.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.199
Then it might be nervous paralysis.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.999
What caused
the nervous paralysis...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.360
the doctors are clueless.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.640
- Such a strange death!
- Yes.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.680
Never heard or seen
such a murder!

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.560
This case will go
to the coroner's court, right?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.400
Sure it will.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.720
And they'll close the case saying
death due to unknown reason.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.600
So...

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.040
we better close the case too.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.239
You may close the case
but I'll keep it open.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.760
Hmm...

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.160
Yeah I know that.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.120
Brinjal fritters?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.360
No Bidhu... not now!

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.520
So Byomkesh...

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.279
do you suspect anyone?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.200
Not anyone in particular
but this case is dicey.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.000
Oh...

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.719
- What do you think of Debkumar's wife?
- That's the wrong path...

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.719
To solve this murder
we've to find the cause of death.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.640
How did that girl die?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.080
- I see...
- We can't just suspect anyone randomly.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.639
No, you must accept that
at the time of her death...

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.319
her stepmother and
her brother was there.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.680
I'm aware of that, Ajit.
I accept it.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.800
But we have to know
the cause of death.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.120
But the doctors
don't know the cause.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.800
The doctors have only examined
the corpse.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.600
We've examined everything else.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.240
So maybe we'll find out
what the doctors couldn't.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.880
Yeah...

00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:03.120
I know you're very much capable
of doing everyone's job.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.320
But you don't have to worry.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.240
This is no time for joke, Ajit.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.920
- Some fritters then?
- Again with the fritters!

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600
- Yes... yes...
- It's quite late.

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:15.400
- Goodbye.
- Yes... goodbye.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.759
- Byomkesh?
- Yes...

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.920
I was saying...

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.480
when you've decided
to go ahead with the case...

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.920
then why not do it together?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.080
Debkumar has dismissed me.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.440
He can't afford me.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920
Can't afford you?

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360
But how?

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.279
I've heard he has
a well-paid job.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.280
He gets Rs. 700-800 as salary.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.400
- Really?
- Yes.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.960
Then...

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.720
Well, if he doesn't want it...

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.920
Yeah... whatever...

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.599
Debkumar might have
dismissed you...

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.999
but since we're going ahead
with the investigation

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.280
I'll call you when I need your help.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.960
- You mean the opposite, right?
- What?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.200
Yes, call me when you need me.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.199
- May I leave now?
- Yes.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.320
Let's go, Ajit.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.040
- Come home someday.
- Of course.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.800
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.880
(indistinct chatter)

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.320
Father...

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.760
You're here.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.080
Good...

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.000
Keep it there.

00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:31.200
Take a seat.
I need to talk to you.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.040
Another conference?

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.840
Coming and going... as he pleases.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.640
This maid is here to do the chores.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.640
How can you leave us
in such a crisis?

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.200
- It's a very important conference, Subhra.
- To hell with that!

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.959
Conference and conference!

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.400
That's all I'm hearing
since we got married.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.640
What is the point?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.399
Have you invented anything
till now?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.480
So that I can proudly show off
to the neighbors?

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.879
The girl is gone...

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.840
Who knows when it'll be my turn?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.120
Life is a living hell.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880
Bloody hell!

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.760
Where are you going, Father?

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.040
Patna.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.120
I have to attend a conference.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.920
The train leaves tomorrow night.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.160
Come with me...

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.840
I don't feel so good.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.200
I'll be relieved if you come.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.680
You'll come, right?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.880
Sure.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.640
Dr. Roy, we can't make any sense
of this case.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.200
Everything is foggy.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.240
How can I catch the killer...

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.480
when I can't even suspect anyone
with all my heart?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.160
Do something.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.639
I can't go beyond this report.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640
But...

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.439
I have a theory of my own.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.920
And that is...

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.960
I think...

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.239
Smelling an unknown poisonous gas
is the cause of death.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.839
Because she was
lighting the oven then?

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.120
Yes...

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.480
I can't think of anything else.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.120
An unknown poisonous gas...

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.440
Gas?

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.080
Foggy!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.319
SUBHRA,
NONTU,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.479
DR. RUDRA,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.960
DEBKUMAR,
HABUL.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.400
Life is hard without Satyabati.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.359
This is all I could rustle up, brother.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.480
Eat up.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.280
You call these brinjal fritters?
They look like amoeba.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.280
Far better than your fried eggs.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.799
Finish this.
Then make the tea.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.840
I've to carry on with writing.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.720
Yuck!

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.080
So you won't make the tea?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.400
Wait... I'll get it.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.559
- You know, Ajit...
- Hmm.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.760
I also think some poisonous gas
killed Rekha.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.840
You mean...

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.840
the police doctor guessed it right?

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.960
Right now I don't see
any other possibility.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.360
This is the only logical deduction
right now.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.160
Since, no poison was found
in her body...

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.080
this is the only possible cause.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.199
But we have to remember...

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.720
scientists have no idea
about this gas.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.279
That means it's a new discovery.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.400
Now the question is
where did the poison come from?

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.360
There are only two scientists
in our vicinity.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.120
One is Dr. Rudra and
another is Debkumar.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.319
If Debkumar invented this poison...

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.200
why would he give it
to his own daughter?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.240
That's unnatural!

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.880
What can be the motive?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.239
It seemed like
he loved his daughter a lot.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240
Hmm...

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.760
Then Dr. Rudra becomes
the prime suspect.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.480
Dr. Rudra has motive too.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.040
He might be a scoundrel
but will he kill for such a petty reason?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.320
But the question is
how will he get to Rekha?

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.840
And how will he sneak the poison in?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.800
I'll pay a visit
to Dr. Rudra tomorrow.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.440
Let it be.
Two spoons of sugar in my tea...

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.800
I've to make it then?

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.719
Gas chamber treatment.
Great arrangement!

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.520
Our country should legally start it too.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.360
Otherwise the scum
crowding this city...

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.480
can't be washed away.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:10.320
So you support the gruesome
'Aktion T4' programme of the Nazis...

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.320
happening in Poland?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.799
Of course, I do.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.000
Your famous dead poet himself had said...

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.480
the world is a great battlefield.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.520
A murder which improves a race
is not a sin.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.360
Only the weak criticize it.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.800
They're killing Jews like rats
in gas chambers.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.760
Do you really think
that improves a race?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.760
Of course, it can.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.840
Who are they actually killing?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.639
Those who are born
with a hereditary defect.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.240
People affected by a hereditary disease.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.320
They are a burden to society anyway.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.599
You're a doctor yourself.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400
And you're calling patients
society's burden?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.280
Yes, I am.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:24.320
Do you know how much the German government
spends on these defective people?

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.040
I read in a medical journal...

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.440
the cost is nearly
60,000 Reichsmark...

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.560
Too much money is being spent!

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.879
Where is the money coming from?

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.520
The citizen's taxes.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.360
Why would they tolerate it?

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.440
So you must have also wanted to kill
a terminally ill patient?

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.280
I have!

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.280
But it's illegal in our country.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.240
But...

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.240
I have complete faith on Hitler.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.160
He doesn't have petty sentiments.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.159
Take my word...

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.279
One day that man
will rule the world.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.600
Absolutely!

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.640
So Rekha was a disease
that infected your son?

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.600
What are you trying to find out?

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.199
Whether I have murdered Rekha
or not?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.080
Yes.

00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:40.760
I wanted to, of course.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.240
Let's say
that I've murdered her.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.480
But how will you prove it?

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.000
Byomkesh...

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.920
The tea is getting cold.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.600
Goodbye.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.040
Father, did you call me?

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.120
Yes...

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.719
I bought these for you two.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.760
I thought we can be happy now.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.200
But...

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.120
"But it turned to a sea of poison."

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.760
Dr. Rudra is an evil "friend".

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.480
- You mean "fiend"...
- Right! Evil fiend.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:35.240
He killed that tetanus patient
just to test his new medicine.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:42.839
If I could hang him for murder...

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.519
I would have sacrificed
two goats at the Goddess' altar.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.400
A ceremonial sacrifice!

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.400
It's best to investigate with a clear
and unbiased mind.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.040
But for the first time,
even I want Dr. Rudra to be the culprit.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.239
It'll be good riddance!

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.960
It'll benefit the nation.
What say, Ajit?

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.080
Hmm.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.440
You're right.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.280
- Bidhu?
- Yes?

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.040
Didn't you like the omelette?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.440
It's very tasty.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.320
Never had a sweet omelette before.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.920
Very good.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.039
Byomkesh made it.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.600
Sweet?

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.520
Ajit, that jar on the top shelf...
It's salt, right?

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.760
That's sugar... told you many times.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.920
Don't mind, Bidhu.
I'm really distracted by this case.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.480
- We had burnt rice last night.
- Not enough water...

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.760
No... no.
No problem at all.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.359
No issue at all.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.960
Salt and sugar are
the same anyway.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.200
Too much of either can make us ill.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.560
Salt increases your blood pressure.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.319
- And sugar...
- Gives you diabetes.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.000
Right.

00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:03.800
The sooner Satyabati comes back,
the better for both of you.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.840
- You're right...
- Yes...

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.039
Oh! About 'Nonta'...

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.439
- Who's "Nonta"?
- It's Nontu.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.440
Dr. Rudra's son.

00:23:16.441 --> 00:23:20.320
He blamed Rekha
for his father's death.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.919
- Do you mean the opposite?
- Yes...

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.280
Blamed his father
for Rekha's death...

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.719
That lad has joined
the Communist party.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.880
That's obvious.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.279
His father's behavior has turned him
into a communist.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.199
Communist, my foot!

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.959
They have thrown him out
of the party.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.319
Revolution can barely spare time
for love.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.799
The opposite, right?

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.440
- Yeah, revolution can't happen...
- If one gets busy with love.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.920
God knows, where he is now...

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.519
I'm feeling really hungry.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.040
- I'll make you an omelette with salt.
- No, no!

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.320
Let it be.

00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:01.599
- Is there a snack bar nearby?
- Finances are weak...

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.959
- No, it's on me.
- Come, Ajit...

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.639
- Yes, let's go.
- Please come every day.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.080
Let's go.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.160
I made this for you.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.760
This is very beautiful.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.279
Please wear it.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.799
You reach home late.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.360
And you catch a cold very easily.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.520
As your wish, madam.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.680
Let's go home.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.960
Let's stay longer.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.720
But your father will scold you?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.000
Why will he scold me?
I'm not a kid.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.159
If you are such a grown up...

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.559
then why aren't you
telling your father about us?

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.360
I'll tell him.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.719
Do you think I'm afraid of him?

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.360
- Aren't you?
- No...

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.359
- How will I live without you?
- Oh, God!

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.800
What are you doing?

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.240
Enough!
Let's go home.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.600
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.520
Let's go.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.479
It was nice.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.879
We could've spent some more time.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.479
I made it only for you.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.999
Do you know how long it took
to finish?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.759
It's getting really cold here.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.879
Wear it to work every day.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.280
This will remind you
of me every time.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.039
Bidhu, let's order more...

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.320
- Have mine...
- It's cold.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.919
- Hey! One more.
- For me too.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.720
Make it two.

00:25:39.721 --> 00:25:41.840
My pressure is rising.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.159
Really, huh?

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:43.880
- Hmm...
- Have some tea.

00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:45.840
Ajit, order for some tea.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.479
- See this, Ajit.
- Hmm...

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.639
This fritter is so well crafted...
Looks as good as it tastes.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.680
Do you remember the ones you made?
They looked so strange.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.760
The tea is good too.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.639
Bidhu, found out about
Debkumar's financial condition?

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.240
Yes... I did.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.359
His financial condition
is not that good at present.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.280
But you said
he earns Rs. 800 as salary.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.599
That's true...

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.919
but he spends a lot I think.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.920
Or else, who buys insurance
worth Rs. 50,000 at this age?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.360
- Life insurance worth Rs. 50,000?
- Yes.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.519
- For himself?
- No, jointly.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.879
For him and his second wife.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.600
For both of them.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.399
So that in his absence...

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.479
his widow can have
financial stability.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.680
His children will get
nothing from it.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.080
Anything more?

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.560
I had his son, Habul, followed too.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.719
He's a college student.
But he never goes there.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.799
He roams around in the streets.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.200
He hangs around in the parks
and smokes.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.280
Hail Mother Goddess!

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.160
Thief!

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.999
Bandit!

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.119
They want to take everything away
from me!

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.079
I pray all day
and keep to myself.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.760
Still that moron can't stand it!

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.320
What's the matter?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.360
Do you want to know?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.600
Your precious son...

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.720
he stole my matchbox!

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.080
Oh, no!

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.960
Primordial murder!

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.679
The original murder!

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.680
Bidhu, wait here.
Come on, Ajit.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.640
How can a murder be original or fake?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Can I return this?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.119
- Have you seen Habul?
- No...

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.360
Habul...

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:03.720
All: Down with Fascism!
Make peace, not war!

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.880
Oh, God!
What's going on?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.560
- Byomkesh!
- Ajit...

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.400
- Debkumar is going to Patna tonight, right?
- Yes... yes...

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.759
- We can't let him go.
- Why is that?

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.919
- No... no... we can't let him go.
- But why... what...

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.480
Ajit, you're not getting it...

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.160
Habul!

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.920
<i>Destiny's cruel revenge, Ajit.</i>

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.560
It's a savage mockery!

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.320
- Byomkesh.
- Did you get the warrant?

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.280
Hmm.

00:30:34.281 --> 00:30:35.320
Let's go, Ajit.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.880
What's going...

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.839
Byomkesh, what's the matter?
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.680
Who is the warrant for?
Where are we going?

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.160
I couldn't find a motive
for Rekha's murder before, Ajit.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.879
Who stands to gain
from Rekha's murder?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.600
Whose plans were Rekha ruining?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.559
The answers to these questions
weren't clear to me earlier.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.080
So, have you found the answers?

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.320
What did you find out?

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.560
Rekha was not the target, Ajit.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.720
Then who was it?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.680
And who is the murderer?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.560
Say something.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.776
- Get in the car.
- What do you mean?

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.280
Bidhu, give me some hint.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.240
Don't walk away.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.760
Hey!

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.240
Hey! Hey!

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.840
"This house of bliss I had built...

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.160
Has burned down to ashes.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.359
I wanted to immerse myself
in the ocean of nectar...

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.480
But it turned to a sea of poison."

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.320
Debkumar, there's a warrant for you.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.840
- Oh! You're here.
- Yes.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.359
I was on my way
to the police station.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.280
Please come with us.
We're not going to cuff you.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.800
Fate!

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.960
Fate!

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.360
In the end, Habul too...

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.280
Byomkesh, what I had planned...

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.600
and the way it turned out.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.000
I wanted Rekha to have
a happy marriage.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.440
I'd have my own modern laboratory.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.240
I'd send Habul abroad.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.920
Careful, Byomkesh!

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.680
Each matchstick is a murder weapon.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.520
You'll be dead if you light it.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.560
My great discovery!

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.399
The victim will die in a moment...

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.280
but it will leave no trace.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.800
A great leap in modern warfare.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.880
Not a poison. A plague.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.480
"But it turned to a sea of poison."

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.640
Let's go.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.000
One minute.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.960
Just a minute.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.280
Let's go.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.160
This is destiny.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.600
After I'm hanged...

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.800
all my insurance money will go
to that woman.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.160
Life's cruel joke,
isn't it, Byomkesh?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.000
How can I accept it?

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.840
Hmm.

00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:18.880
Come on.
It's time to go.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:35.560
Byomkesh? What...
What was he saying?

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.480
Please tell me.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.280
Byomkesh?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:51.040
Byom... Byomkesh?
Byomkesh?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.960
Please tell me, Byomkesh...

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.400
What... What was he saying...

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.639
Byomkesh, I've committed
a lot of crimes...

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.080
If you can...

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.759
Take cover!

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.800
Hey, move!

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.760
Byomkesh?

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.240
Death of a scientist.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.120
What? How?

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.240
He's wearing a flintstone ring.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.320
Uh...

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.239
<i>A letter written to American President
Franklin Roosevelt by Leó Szilárd...</i>

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.960
<i>was signed by Albert Einstein.</i>

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.319
<i>The subject of the letter is the discovery
of uranium for the use of nuclear bombs.</i>

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.839
<i>United States of America takes another step
towards becoming a nuclear superpower.</i>

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.920
<i>Germany has decided to use poisonous
nerve gas, sarin, in World War II.</i>

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:09.319
<i>Sarin gas attacks the human nervous system
killing the victim immediately.</i>

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:14.680
<i>With the entire world up in arms,
chemical warfare...</i>

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.039
There's an old English saying.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.680
"Vengeance coming home to roost."

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.800
Please write your next story
about Debkumar's tragedy.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.799
Make me a minor character.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.480
If you try you'll understand the plot
of the primordial murder.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.400
Subhra wanted Debkumar
all to herself.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.200
She separated him from his children.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.960
And the husband tried to kill her?

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.040
Twice!

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.839
Debkumar aimed his unstoppable
matchstick to kill his wife.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:58.120
But both times, it ended up
hurting his precious children.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.640
- Debkumar's discovery...
- Unexpected!

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.840
He made this discovery
quite by chance.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.439
Do you get it, Ajit?

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.960
His invention couldn't be patented.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.800
Because there was no value for it
in any business... Couldn't be.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.760
Debkumar had no way of using it
because he didn't have money.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.439
<i>If this formula went public...</i>

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.839
<i>warring nations like Japan,
Germany, France</i>

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.799
<i>would start manufacturing
this deadly poison.</i>

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.480
<i>The inventor would get nothing.</i>

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.480
Here you go.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.960
Father, what do you worry about
all day?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.719
Money. I need money.
I need lots of money.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:03.280
I need to buy new equipment
for my laboratory.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.960
Or else the experiments would fail but...

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.439
once the experiment
is successful...

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.640
we won't have to worry anymore.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.359
Have you eaten?

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.880
Yes, I have.
Please eat.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.360
- Please eat.
- Hey!

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.479
Want daddy's cuddles
in the morning?

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.279
What about the wet clothes
rotting in the bucket?

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.439
This maid is here
to put it out to dry, right?

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.400
No, Mother.
I'll do it right away.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.880
Oh no!

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.800
Your tea.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.839
Please do the favour of drinking it.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.360
Why do you scold the girl so much?

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.319
She touched me without taking a bath.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.959
I'll have to bathe again.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.480
Why don't I just die?

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.400
<i>People who work with their minds...</i>

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.920
want a peaceful domestic life.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.320
But that was missing
from Debkumar's life.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.719
He was driven crazy by his obsessive,
abusive, loveless wife!

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.719
Byomkesh, Debkumar didn't look
like a cruel man.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.839
And the way he loved his kids...

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.079
he comes across as a caring man.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.160
His second wife could have
shared this love.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.040
Umm.

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.720
But she lost out because of her nature.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.040
<i>When someone plans to kill his own wife
life must have been intolerable for him.</i>

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.120
Yes, yes... Thank you.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.640
Excuse me.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.319
If one spouse dies, the other spouse
gets all the money, right?

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.039
Yes, sir!

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.480
Why are you asking this question
again and again?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.719
What is your intention?

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.400
Eh...

00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:04.240
What are you saying?

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.519
- I was joking.
- Oh!

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:14.319
The world is at war.
We might die at any moment.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.440
Best to have a laugh
whenever possible.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.680
Thank you.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.519
He wanted to hit two birds with one arrow
with the life insurance policy.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.159
He would get all the money by killing
his wife with the poison he invented.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.080
And no one would be able
to trace the poison either.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.119
<i>After getting the Rs. 50,000 life
insurance, Debkumar waited patiently.</i>

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.159
<i>He couldn't rush.</i>

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.280
<i>The life insurance company
might become suspicious.</i>

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.000
Eat up!

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.920
What happened next?

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.080
One year went by.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.479
Debkumar felt deeply agitated.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.840
He decided to cast his fiery arrow soon.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.880
Yes! Yes! I've done it!

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.280
The nature of the poison he invented
was like gunpowder.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.120
It was harmless.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.280
But once it comes in contact with fire
it takes the form of dangerous gas.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.919
Just a whiff of the gas
is enough to kill.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.360
Instant death.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.840
Debkumar found the most effective way
to poison his wife.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:00.000
Only a scientific mind could
come up an idea like this, Ajit.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.120
<i>He knew she lights a lamp every night
with a matchstick.</i>

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.999
<i>Especially when she was alone.</i>

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.760
<i>And this matchbox isn't used
anywhere else.</i>

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.000
He finished his task secretly
before leaving for the Delhi conference.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.280
He knew today or tomorrow...

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.240
his wife would light the match.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.880
<i>Debkumar would be 900 miles away.</i>

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.439
<i>No one would even think
it was his doing.</i>

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.040
Take care.

00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:22.200
- Yes.
- Have a safe trip.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.720
Everything will be fine.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.599
Drive.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.360
- Please call once you reach.
- Okay.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.920
It was all great
but destiny had other plans.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.560
Instead of his wife,
Rekha lit the match.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.559
<i>After this disaster,
he became even more furious.</i>

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.599
<i>He became adamant.</i>

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.560
<i>Now that his daughter was dead,
his wife must die too.</i>

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:27.160
How can I live now?

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.280
How can you take her, God?

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.200
After that, he set the same trap.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.280
This time before leaving for Patna.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.120
And again the plan failed.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:59.080
Debkumar had dragged out a fatal poison
from the dark abyss of science.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.760
"But it turned to a sea of poison."

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.440
Remember Debkumar's speeches?

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.600
You had dismissed it as
unbearble incompetence.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.880
Strange thing is he made
a unique discovery.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.520
Yes...

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.960
Tell me.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.920
How did you suspect Debkumar?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.200
- When I heard about life insurance.
- I see.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.080
And the mode of the murder?

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:34.880
When Rekha died,
she had a burnt matchstick in one hand...

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.080
and a matchbox in another hand.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.840
Therefore, she died
after lighting the match.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.720
- Could have been an accident.
- Or could have been a causality.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.960
You know where
Debkumar's genius was?

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.000
He kept only one poisonous matchstick
in the box.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.400
So during the investigation,
there were no poisoned matchsticks.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.840
It was the same in Habul's case.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.760
Habul took the same matchbox
with him.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.720
And Habul lit the same match.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.960
Ajit, you are a writer.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:15.680
Don't you see a metaphor
in Debkumar's story?

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.320
You know what, brother?

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.999
When Man discovered
the first weapon to kill...

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.760
he had also made
his own deathbed.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.880
Absolutely true.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.880
The germ of violence is secretly
being sowed all over the world.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.760
Ultimately, it will destroy the human race.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.920
It will annihilate the creator.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.520
Don't you agree, Ajit?

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.080
Byomkesh!

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.880
THE FIERY ARROW
