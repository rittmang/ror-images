WEBVTT

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.560
Here you go.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.080
Couldn't sleep all night.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.040
- Fell asleep at dawn.
- Hmm.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.279
Even if the essential
people of Bengal sleep...

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.600
my truth-seeking friend can't.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm very proud of him.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.760
I feel great pride
in my friend and ally.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.920
The job puts a lot of stress
on the brain.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.839
Without enough rest...

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.000
the body will give way.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.040
I'll get it.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.480
Hello?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200
Yes, speaking...

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.680
Yes, yes.
Tell me.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.440
What?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.320
When?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.560
Yes, we're coming.
Goodbye.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.759
Satyabati, call Byomkesh.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.960
- Immediately?
- Yes, immediately. Call him.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.400
- Stop!
- Wait!

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.240
Stop, I say!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.080
He suffered the second attack
last night.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.200
Dr. Sen was there but...

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.919
What did the doctor write
in the death certificate?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680
Natural death.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.119
Why? Do you suspect foulplay?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.439
No, there's nothing suspicious but...

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.120
At such a time, a little carelessness
or wilful negligence can be fatal.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.719
If Rameshwar dies, it isn't a loss
for any of them.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.159
Rather, they all gain from it.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.999
If Rameshwar has left a will...

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.239
And if he has included Nalini in it...

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.160
Don't you think they'd destroy it
if they knew?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.839
We have to chase the will, Ajit.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.200
That one.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.960
Byomkesh?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360
Let's go.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.520
Stop!
Or I'll shoot!

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.800
Stop, I say!

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.160
Wait! Stop!

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.800
I'm telling you to stop!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120
- Her?
- Come.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640
Nalini?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.600
Greetings! I am Byomkesh Bakshi.
I got your address from Dr. Asim Sen.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.480
What a coincidence, Byomkesh!
I was just about to visit you!

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.440
Can we talk inside?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.320
Stop!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.720
Day before yesterday
I received this letter from dad.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.280
Last night... it all ended.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.560
Who gave you the news?
Dr. Sen?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.960
Hmm.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.040
"My dear, sending you and son-in-law
blessings for the New Year.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.840
When you get news of my death,
meet Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.480
Your well-wisher,
Father."

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.080
When did you last meet Rameshwar?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.800
Last year, at the end
of the Durga festival.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.440
That's alright.
Hey!

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.640
You didn't go there today?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320
No.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.680
Did your sister-in-law dislike you
from the very beginning?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.880
Yes.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.440
Nalini, Dr. Sen told me that...

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.160
Rameshwar has made a will.
Do you know where that will is?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.880
How would I know?

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320
My sister-in-law always kept Father
confined to his room.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.760
And he had become very frail.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.280
He couldn't come out
from his second-floor room.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.440
Hmm?
Okay.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.439
So, if Father had made a will, then...

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.239
He has surely left me something.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.320
Certainly... Otherwise there would be
no need for a will.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.840
But is it still there?

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200
My sister-in-law
must have destroyed it.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.160
Your father was a very wise man, Nalini.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.559
I firmly believe that if he...

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.239
has made a will, it's so tactfully
hidden that no one can find it easily.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.079
We need to get to it
before Kusheshwar or Lavanya do.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.159
No, there's a problem, Byomkesh.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.640
Two witnesses are required
to make a will.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.599
In that case, if Rameshwar has made a will,
who are the two witnesses?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.599
No, there are exceptions
and laws.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.879
If you write the entire will
in your own hand...

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.400
Then you don't need any witnesses.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640
Oh.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.160
I firmly believe that...

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.001
The will is in the house itself.
We have to search for it.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.840
Who will grant us permission?

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:33.559
We will have to take help
from the police.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.160
- Ma'am!
- Hmm?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.600
The police have arrested Debnath.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.480
What happened again?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.200
Abhay Ghoshal was murdered yesterday.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.159
What?
Really?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.200
Yes.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.359
That traitor Laltu
informed the police that...

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.520
Last night, they were supposed
to go together, so...

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.079
- Abhay has been murdered?
- Yes.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.000
Nalini, what is the relation
between Abhay Ghoshal and Debnath?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.599
They were friends...

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.720
- They were in the Swadeshi Movement together.
- What!

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.399
Abhay Ghoshal was part
of the Swadeshi Movement?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.760
Yes.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Abhay Ghoshal,
Swadeshi Movement!

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320
Ajit?

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.560
- Ajit!
- Hmm?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.840
Let's go.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.520
Goodbye.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.640
- Hmm.
- Okay, sir.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.360
Abhay Ghoshal was a rich man's son
but he was wanderer.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.559
The two murder cases he was involved in...

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.280
both victims were associated
with the black market.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.280
So, it couldn't be proven that Abhay
Ghoshal murdered or was involved.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.959
Abhay Ghoshal was part
of the Swadeshi Movement...

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.120
How can I say for sure?
There's no proof.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.960
Wow, there's no proof?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.920
Mhm.

00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:17.159
And what we heard
about his father...

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.040
That also seems suspicious.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.000
His father, Adhar Ghoshal...

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.280
<i>had informed the police about a
secret hideout of a revolutionary group.</i>

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.720
<i>The Swadeshis were not prepared
for such a sudden police raid.</i>

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.919
<i>That day, some Swadeshi workers died
in the shootout...</i>

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.160
Hands up!

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.800
<i>Among them was
named Dinanath Das.</i>

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.280
Dinanath Das is Debnath Das' father.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.759
So, what does the guy's father do?

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.039
He was part of the Swadeshi Movement.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.600
He was shot dead by the police.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.400
Adhar Ghoshal was found dead
in his home.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.960
They found poison
in his stomach.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.760
<i>It was clear
that Abhay Ghoshal was the murderer.</i>

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.760
<i>The lizrd asks the mosquito
if it wants to drink blood!</i>

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.680
At least, you admit you're a mosquito!

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.639
Yes.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.360
But I know who
to suck blood out of.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:23.440
(chanting prayer for the deceased)

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.479
But he had such a strong alibi that...

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.399
But nothing could be proven.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.760
- He's like Robin Hood!
- Yes, they had a gang.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.640
And Debnath used to be part of that gang.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.800
And Abhay Ghoshal indirectly helped them
with money and ideas.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.680
I can't quite understand how
to solve the case.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.400
I see a vague puzzle
but just can't piece it together.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.480
A puzzle? What's the puzzle?
Let's see if I can solve it.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.040
You?

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.600
Yes, I can try.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.320
- Try? Oh.
- Yes.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.240
So...

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.039
Bishu Pal is hiding
from Abhay Ghoshal.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.760
Yes.

00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:42.440
Abhay Ghoshal works
with Debnath Das.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.119
Debnath is Rameshwar Ray's son-in-law.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.160
Hmm.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.079
Rameshwar Ray is like a brother
to Bishu Pal.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.959
Rameshwar's son Kusheshwar is
like Bishu Pal's student.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.079
Rameshwar Ray has arranged
for his son's fees to Bishu Pal...

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.920
- which has to be found...
- Oh...

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.000
by Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.040
- So, Bidhu, you want to try?
- No! Let it be.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.560
You said Bongo Pal is lame, right?
- It's Bishu Pal.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.759
No, no, no.
That needs to be examined first.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.639
Yes, then at least we get a starting point
for the case.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.199
Wait, wait, wait, Bidhu. First you
have to arrange for something else.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.080
What?

00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:31.799
I feel, Ajit that the solution to this case
is in Rameshwar's will.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.479
Go to Rameshwar's house with Bidhu.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.839
- And you?
- I have some other work.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.440
- Bidhu?
- Yes?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.120
You'll have to arrange
for that too.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.960
Okay.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.240
- Please come.
- Yes, let's go.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.519
- Greetings, Dr. Rakshit. He's Dr. Asim sen.
- Greetings.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.159
- He'll examine Bishu once.
- Greetings.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.920
- Ramapati?
- Examine?

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.799
- What are you saying?
- I'm the local police in charge...

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.160
Ramapati Dutta.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.799
- Here's the order.
- Order... examination... what are you saying?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.439
Last night Abhay Ghoshal
was murdered.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.439
I want to talk to Bishu about that.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.240
Murdered?
Abhay Ghoshal?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.599
Murdered.
Abhay Ghoshal.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.839
- Let's go?
- Huh?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.560
- Come on.
- Yes.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.200
- What's the matter?
- Go. Go!

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.080
- But what...
- Go!

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.640
Wh-What's going on?

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.599
Come in.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.960
Search the rooms inside.
Go on.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.840
- Okay, sir.
- Search for what?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.919
Two of you stand there.
By that door.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.879
- Bidhu?
- Yes?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.800
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.000
Hmm.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.000
<i>Abhay Ghoshal has been murdered?</i>

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.800
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.000
Open the windows.
You'll feel more ill this way.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.440
Now I'll open them.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.520
I... I have no fear now.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:07.400
Only, I lost an interest
of Rs. 33,400.55.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.880
- At least your life is saved.
- That's true.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.080
And I'll also save on the
of Rs. 10 each, that's Rs. 20,
on the guards salary.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.800
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.240
Open the window.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.760
Please go ahead
with your examination.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.240
Hmm.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.999
- Sir.
- Hmm?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.479
Searched the whole house.
Found no deed, only a few racing books.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.440
They were harrassed for nothing.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.360
No, Bidhu.
Someone has searched the room before us.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.600
Where did Byomkesh go?

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.360
Kusheshwar, have you found the will?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.960
Weren't you a writer?
When did you become a detective?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.159
Perhaps you're forgetting,
detectives are born from a writer's pen.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.880
- Father made no will.
- No, we don't have a doubt about that.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.200
Because Rameshwar wrote the same letter
to Byomkesh and Nalini, so...

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.160
Where did you suddenly
disappear, Byomkesh?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.040
Dr. Sen says
that the paralysis is genuine.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.199
Yes, that's obvious.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.680
Why would an old man
pretend to be lame for no reason?

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.760
Let's go.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.920
Take a look.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.960
Onions?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.160
- Lavanya?
- Yes?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.520
Did your father-in-law like
to eat raw onions?

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.879
Can't say he liked it.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.480
But before he died,
he was tempted to have raw onions.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.279
Before he died, isn't it?

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.519
Yes.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.639
He had weak teeth,
so he ground the onions.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.119
So, this was how many days
before he died?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.000
- Around 10-12 days before.
- Ten-twelve days...

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.279
- Ajit?
- Hmm?

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.920
Why don't you write a story?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.560
'Life's Last Onion Fritter'!

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.600
<i>Onions...</i>

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.840
<i>Souvenir...</i>

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.840
<i>Student...</i>

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.920
<i>Empty dispensary...</i>

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.320
<i>Racing booklets...</i>

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.080
<i>Debnath...</i>

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.960
<i>Bishu Pal...</i>

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.720
Tonight at 11 o'clock
at the Kumortuli river bank...

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.080
Judge for yourself
whether I'm telling the truth.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.840
Hello, Rakshit?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.600
Yes, Byomkesh Bakshi here.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.840
We want to speak
to Bishu Pal again.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.880
Today itself.
We'll be there shortly, okay?

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.880
Great, great.
I'm hanging up.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.760
What exactly do you want to do?

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.960
- Occupy the kingdom of Chedi.
- Chedi?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.159
- Bidhu?
- Yes?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.920
- A cigarette, please?
- Yes.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.360
Here.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.399
Greetings, Byomkesh.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.840
- Greetings, Ajit.
- Greetings.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.240
What were you doing, Dr. Rakshit?

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.479
General check-up.
I do it in the evenings.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.000
- How was the check-up?
- It'll take some time.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.080
The illness is severe, you see.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.200
- It'll take some time now.
- Oh really?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.960
I feel Bishu is quite healthy.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.439
Isn't it, Bishu?

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.079
No, no.
What are you saying, Byomkesh!

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.720
He's unwell.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.480
He's not healthy?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.320
- Alright, let me check once.
- Huh?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.520
Hey! B...
B...

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.759
There.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.360
What do you think, Bishu?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.760
What are you saying?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.479
Bishu, you have to accompany us
for some very important work.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.079
- Come on, we'll need you.
- No, Byomkesh, he will not leave.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.639
Wait, wait, wait, Byomkesh.
Listen to me.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.000
Byomkesh, listen to me.
Byomkesh!

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.080
Come on.

00:19:38.081 --> 00:19:41.079
Byomkesh, it's in poor taste to joke
with a disbaled person like this.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.320
What do I do, Suresh?
There's a paucity of good taste too.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.080
Step aside.

00:19:45.081 --> 00:19:46.679
- I'm telling you, you...
- Move.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.719
Why are you all just standing
and watching?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.000
- Inspector, they're misbehaving with a sick man...
- Stop it.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.640
- Come on.
- Byomkesh, this isn't right.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.560
Hey!

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.719
See, Bishu?

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.456
Didn't I say there's nothing wrong
with your legs?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.400
They're absolutely fine.
And why won't they be fine?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.200
This afternoon I mixed a fake Procaine
in the injection.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.800
Open the windows.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.760
<i>When Dr. Sen began to examine you...</i>

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.400
<i>I took the opportunity
to get my own work done.</i>

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.400
<i>Luck aided me, Bishu.
The guard outside your room was sleeping.</i>

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.320
<i>That's it!</i>

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.400
How will the fake Procaine,
numb his legs, Rakshit?

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.360
Byomkesh, I've heard of Cocaine
but what's Procaine?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.840
This afternoon I came to know
about it from Dr. Asim Sen.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.599
Earlier, chloroform was used on a patient
to make him unconscious for an operation.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.199
We don't need it anymore.
There are medicines like Procaine.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.279
If this is injected
in certain areas in the spinal cord...

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.840
Some parts of the body
become numb.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.720
Then that part can be easily operated on.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.160
This is Procaine.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.560
It was then that I became suspicious.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.680
That with this Procaine injection,
Dr. Rakshit proves Bishu as paralysed...

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.040
But the effect of medicines like Procaine
doesn't stay for more than 5-6 hours.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.800
No outsider came to know
about this.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.480
Only Suresh Rakshit knew...
You knew too, right?

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.919
The workers all know
that the owner is paralysed.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.599
Ther's no reason to doubt it.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.479
And Bishu, you were expecting the police
about Abhay Ghoshal's murder...

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.880
to come to your house.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.800
<i>That's why, Dr. Rakshit, taking no risks,
gave you an injection this morning.</i>

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.080
That's why Dr. Sen's examination
showed you were paralysed.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.160
Then, when I called to say that I'm coming
again today, then in the evening...

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.640
he gave you another injection.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.800
<i>But that had fake Procaine.</i>

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.600
<i>So it did not work.</i>

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.200
I don't know...
I'm checking it.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.079
Am I saying anything wrong, Dr. Rakshit?

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.720
I'll file a defamation suit against you.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.280
You won't be able
to file a suit.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.720
You need money for that.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.520
There's no one but flies
in your dispensary.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.280
Probably can't even pay the rent
and he'll file a suit!

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.679
Isn't it, Bishu Pal?

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.280
Suresh Rakshit is also
one of your debtors, right?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.320
You've decorated his dispensary
so that he doesn't seem like a fake doctor.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.159
Why?
Why would I do that?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.000
Huh?

00:23:35.001 --> 00:23:37.960
Strange!
Because you'll need the doctor.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.359
- Hey, catch him!
- Hey! Arrest him!

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.519
Take him away.
We must build a strong case against him.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.359
Take him to the police station.
Go. Go!

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.519
Go. Take him away.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.240
Come on!

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.920
So, Byomkesh?

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.080
What are you going to arrest me for?

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.280
For lying in bed, paralysed?

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.480
Can it hold water in court?

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.640
Your crime is more severe.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.440
You see...

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.440
Abhay and Debnath together...

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.920
<i>would loot rice from merchants and
distribute it among the famine-stricken.</i>

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.520
<i>Then, after tricking Debnath...</i>

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.840
Abhay started black marketing
with that rice.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.480
Abhay used to work
for the common people till now.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.160
<i>That's why he was my friend.</i>

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.319
But the black market
during this famine...

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.880
turned him too.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.320
Traitor.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.320
<i>Last night...</i>

00:25:01.321 --> 00:25:04.840
Abhay reached the river bank
to loot the rice.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.279
<i>He had already made a deal
with the boatmen.</i>

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.119
<i>Debnath also got the news
and secretly went there.</i>

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.520
<i>But that man had already reached
before him...</i>

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.240
The man whose rice
was being smuggled.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.760
Who was that?
Bishu Pal himself.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.719
I found out from police records...

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.480
that two of your debtors
have been killed before.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.999
They, probably, couldn't
return your money either.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.359
Nothing could be proven
in those cases.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.559
So you went ahead with the same plan.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.040
But this time you had a brilliant ruse
for your alibi.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040
Greetings.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.839
<i>You're a cunning man, Bishu.</i>

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.199
<i>You sent Suresh Rakshit to my house
to call for me.</i>

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.399
I'm here on behalf of a patient.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.519
Hmm.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.479
<i>You needed a witness
whom no one would disbelieve.</i>

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.280
- And if you could tell me when you can go...
- I'll go today itself.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.679
Oh, wow!
That's great.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.200
If you could tell me
around what time...

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.320
<i>I told Suresh that I'll go
at six o'clock.</i>

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:25.640
<i>So, Suresh gave you the Procaine injection
at maybe around one or two o'clock.</i>

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.480
You had decided
that you would murder Abhay last night.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.840
Accordingly, you had the story
of the loot all set.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.839
When you got to know that we had visited
Abhay's house...

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.240
You sent Suresh Rakshit
after us right away?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.840
<i>Huh?
How strange!</i>

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.359
You're losing your temper, Byomkesh.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.879
It's because of such people that Bengal
is facing such a famine today, Ajit.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.160
History will not forgive them.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.880
Coachman, let's go, hurry up!
Come on, drive fast.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.400
<i>Around 8 p.m.
your legs were back to normal.</i>

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.600
Sir, I'm leaving for the night.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.960
<i>One of your guards leaves at that time
and another comes at 11 p.m.</i>

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.880
<i>I think you left home
at around 8:30 p.m.</i>

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.999
<i>According to the plan, Abhay Ghoshal
was busy looting your rice.</i>

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.479
<i>Debnath already knew about that plan.</i>

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.559
<i>Debnath is a true patriot.</i>

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.039
<i>He doesn't want to spare
the country's enemy.</i>

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.880
<i>Meanwhile, you reached the river bank too.</i>

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.360
<i>After committing the murder,
you came back home by 11 p.m.</i>

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.360
<i>No one came to know.</i>

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.359
And it's so difficult
to doubt your alibi...

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.399
A man's who's been paralysed
for three months...

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.160
How can he murder someone?
Impossible!

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.560
Who'll be your witness
at the court, Byomkesh?

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.880
That convicted hooligan, Debnath?

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.600
The fact that Abhay Ghoshal
wanted to kill me...

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.080
There are many witnesses
to testify to it.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.159
And what do you think?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.519
Even if I have murdered someone...

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.280
I did it in self-defence.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.240
The law excuses that, hmm?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.039
One has the right to murder
for self-defence, but...

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:49.360
the law doesn't pardon a cold blooded
murder planned for three months.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.400
You had made a mistake.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.120
A greedy moneylender...

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.599
who's part of the black market
stealing the food of the poor...

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.839
thus, creating this famine...

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.519
A man like that called for me,
and told me his sad story...

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:14.680
And spent Rs. 100
to find out the meaning of a letter.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.000
Will you be able to prove
that I smuggle rice for the black market?

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.120
You don't do it yourself.
You have people for that.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.399
Who's that fellow now?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.999
- Bidhu?
- Yes?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.239
- You go the rice godown with Bishu.
- Okay.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.399
Ajit and I are bringing that fellow
to the storehouse.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.840
- Alright.
- Let's go, Shishu Pal.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.239
Can't let you go on
till you commit your hundredth crime.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.199
You'll be struck down before that.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.719
Come on, get up.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.200
I will not go anywhere.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.240
Get up!

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.679
Hurry up! Fast!

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.640
Stop it.
Stop it!

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:03.040
(indistinct chatter)

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.240
What happened?
Go on.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.800
<i>Why have you arrested my husband?</i>

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.640
- What has he done?
- I'll tell you.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.759
But what I'll tell you...

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.120
is mostly heard from Debnath
and the rest is my guess.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.480
Correct me if I'm wrong, Lavanya. Okay?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.400
Your husband, Kusheshwar, had lost
a lot of money at the racing ground.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.239
Then Rameshwar made sure
that he didn't have money to lose.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.760
And he didn't get much support
from you either, Lavanya.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400
<i>Then, Kusheshwar...</i>

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.040
came to Bishu Pal for help.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.239
He took money from Bishu Pal
to go to the races again.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.840
But unfortunately, and naturally,
he couldn't return Bishu Pal's money.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.880
Then Bishu Pal put him
in a tight spot.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.199
Will I be able to do this?

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.400
I don't know. This is the work.
That's it!

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.640
This isn't a sin, right?

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.639
Sin, my foot.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.319
- You're mocking me...
- Everyone's making money during this war and famine.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.399
But it's wrong when we do it?

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.680
Do exactly as Bishu Uncle says.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.639
- Softly.
- Shut up. Softly!

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.279
- Why softly?
- My...

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280
Hmph!

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:58.320
Kumod, my own son has a role
to play in this famine?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.040
<i>And here my years are waning.</i>

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.600
<i>But before I die...</i>

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.280
<i>I have to atone...</i>

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.760
- Isn't it?
- Hmm?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.759
No, Kumod...

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:21.480
I won't leave my property
in that idiot's hands.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:28.720
I must make arrangements
for you and Nalini.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.839
Rameshwar decided to make a will.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.159
But how could he ensure that the
will remain intact after his death?

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.040
Then, Nalini, your father came up
with a very clever solution.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.319
Last night, I had a terrible nightmare.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.959
I was in heaven after death.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.760
And they send you straight to hell
if you even mention onions there.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:06.000
- What will happen?
- But your food is cooked with onions.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.479
But I won't be able to eat onions
after death.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.240
I want to eat all the onions
in this life itself.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.120
From now on,
give me 10 whole onions every day.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:26.400
Okay... okay.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.479
<i>I wouldn't have gotten to the root
of Rameshwar's billiant idea...</i>

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.400
<i>had Ajit not brought up
the matter with me.</i>

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.199
You see, Kusheshwar?

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.160
You can't forget that many detectives
are born of a writer's pen.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.760
But where is the will?
Will you be able to show it?

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.880
Satyabati?
Hey, Satyabati!

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.879
- Satyabati!
- Goodness, what's the matter?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.520
Satyabati, where have you kept
Rameshwar's letter?

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.480
- I don't know, look for it yourself.
- What do you...

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.960
You really don't know?
Ajit, where did I keep it?

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.999
- I don't know.
- How strange!

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.919
How's this possible!
A letter can't just vanish from the house.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.599
Tell me why you're looking for it.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.519
Rameshwar had asked me to keep the letter
as his last memory.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.519
- I didn't understand the meaning then, Ajit.
- You...

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.079
You never told us the meaning
of that poem.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.880
Forget the poem.
That letter is Rameshwar's will.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.799
If I don't get that letter
I'll be ruined.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.359
Please, tell me where it is.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.159
- Try and find it in your mind.
- Why are you doing this with me?

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.999
You know that these days
I can't recall anything properly.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.159
Try to remember.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.760
What were you doing
when the letter arrived?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.640
What was I doing...
What was I doing? What was I doing?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.439
- Ajit, what I was doing?
- Don't tell him anything.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.120
- Remember it yourself.
- Why are you doing this?

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.040
You know I can't remember things well.
Please tell me.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.960
You must remember.
I won't let you go crazy.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.600
Had Bhishma gone crazy?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.399
<i>Byomkesh, what was the Rs. 5000 about?</i>

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.400
Tell me.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.680
With age...

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.720
<i>Is he really going crazy?</i>

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.719
Bhishma...

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.400
Bhishma's episode.
Bhishma's episode!

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.040
Please get 'the Mahabharata'.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.840
You knew it.
You're just sitting there and laughing!

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.520
Give me, give it here, give it to me.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.120
Oh!

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.560
'Thank you' is very meaningless,
isn't it, Satyabati?

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.120
Ajit?

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.079
Here's the will.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.999
If it's written with onion juice,
it can't be read with the naked eye.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.319
But there's a simple way
to make those letters visible.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.719
Do you want to see?

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.120
Ajit, hold this.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.200
Please step aside, Bishu.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.360
- Ajit, help me out.
- Yes, coming.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.240
- Give me the letter.
- Oh.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.280
"Hail Lord Basudeva!

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:22.400
I, Rameshwar Ray, residing at 17, Shyamdhar
Mitra Lane, Bagbazar, Kolkata...

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.800
am writing my final will
in healthy body and sound mind.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.320
It was not possible to get witnesses
under the circumstances.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.760
Hence, I am writing this will
in my own hand from start to end.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.000
I am not delusional or senile.
Dr. Asim Sen is proof of that.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.360
My three houses in Kolkata
and all the money in my account...

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:49.039
Of them, my house on Harrisson Road
and one lakh rupees...

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.080
shall be bequeathed
to my daughter, Nalini.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.999
My wife, Kumodini, shall enjoy the benefits
of my house in Shyampukur all her life.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.640
After her death, my house in Shyampukur
shall also be given to Nalini.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.240
As regards my son Kusheshwar's
laudable wisdom...

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.800
I donate two lakh rupees
to the relief fund for the famine-stricken.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.200
Bishu, this is your payment.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.719
And my present residence
which is on Shyamdhar Mitra Lane...

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.559
That house and the remaining money in my
account shall be given to Kusheshwar...

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.840
on this condition that he will
look after Kumodini all his life.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.519
If there's any negligence
in looking after Kumodini...

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.640
my son Kusheshwar will have
to leave the house on Shyamdhar Mitra Lane.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.879
The famous truth-seeker Byomkesh Bakshi
and the renowned doctor Asim Sen...

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.760
I declare as executors of my will.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.199
They will make arrangements
as they see fit...

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.560
and will receive Rs. 5000
from my estate as fees.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.279
First day of Baisakh, 1350
according to the Bengali calendar.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:00.000
Signed,
Rameshwar Ray."

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.080
Come on.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.880
There's no need...
No need for this, Debnath...

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.919
It's so simple, huh?
I'll take this will to court.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.839
Hey, speak up.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.639
- Let's go.
- Can you contest it?

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.959
Oh please! Stop it!

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.839
You couldn't stop your old father-in-law
from making a will...

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.039
What makes you think
you can stop the truth-seeker?

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.959
Dr. Asim Sen and Bidhu Bhattacharya here
will testify to this will.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.719
Do you have any witnesses?

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.200
Hey, take them away.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.600
- Come with us.
- What's wrong? Move.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.440
You've hit me where it hurts,
Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.879
I will snatch away your rice.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.159
If that stops you from depriving lakhs
of people of food...

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.079
then so be it, Bishu Pal.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.439
- Go, take him with you.
- Take him away.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.679
- Let's go.
- Come on, I say!

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.600
- Get him into the car.
- Yes, sir.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.600
<i>It's all done.</i>

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.919
But how did you know from the letter
that Rameshwar has made a will?

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.400
Very simple.
Wait, I'll teach you how.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.040
But you won't tell Ajit anything.
Let him rack his brains.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.720
- Okay.
- What was the poem?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.999
"Sing praises of Paramahansa,
by dividing into two his name...

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.760
Beauty claims the second part
and God, the first does claim."

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.959
Which novel did Rameshwar talk about
in his letter?

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.439
- 'Krishnakanta's Will'.
- 'Krishnakanta's Will'.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.079
Paramhansa, that is, Ramkrishna.
What happens if we split the name in two?

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.959
- Ram and Krishna.
- Ram and Krishna.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.199
Now, "Beauty claims the second part
and God, the first does claim."

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.559
What's the second half?

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.520
- Krishna.
- Krishna.

00:42:57.521 --> 00:43:00.479
And if you link Krishna and beauty?

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.959
- 'Kanta' means beauty... Krishnakanta!
- Krishnakanta.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.840
Now, "God, the first does claim."

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.759
- First half means... Ram.
- And when you link Ram with God?

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.199
- Ishwar which means God.
- So the two add up to Rameshwar.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.720
- So, 'Krishnakanta's Will' becomes...
- Rameshwar's will.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.040
- So, does the tale end here?
- No, it doesn't end here.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.680
Then your husband
caused a small stir.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.960
What did you do again?

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.239
Well, Satyabati...

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:38.760
This is probably nothing in the face of
the horrifying famine consuming Bengal...

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.920
But something's better
than nothing.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480
- So, Bidhu?
- Hmm?

00:43:43.481 --> 00:43:45.600
- You'll testify, won't you?
Yes, certainly.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.319
Sir...
The Civil Supply Department.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.879
Hang your Civil Supply Department!

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.800
If anyone hinders this auspicious event,
I'll dismiss him. Dismiss!

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.960
(all cheering)

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:18.920
<i>How many lives will it take
to end this all-consuming famine?</i>

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.639
<i>Even amid all the disappointments...</i>

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.000
<i>I feel like quoting my friend
Jibananda Das again and again...</i>

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.720
<i>"Still the owl lies awake</i>

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:43.880
<i>The dying frog still begs for life</i>

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:53.640
<i>Just for the warmth of another sunrise."</i>
