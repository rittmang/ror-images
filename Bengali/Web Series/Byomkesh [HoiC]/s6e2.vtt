00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.200
Doctor?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.480
Anything to worry about?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.720
No. Nothing serious.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.920
-Since he was hit on the head...
-No, it's not a grave injury but...

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.360
Byomkesh, you must take some rest.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.600
This was done
so that I have to be on rest, Doctor.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
That's why, I can't do it.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.520
Please prescribe some medicine.
I have to go out tomorrow.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.600
-You're being too much now.
-You don't get it, Satya.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.160
If I stay at home right now,
I'll miss out on many important clues.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.400
I have to go out tomorrow.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680
I won't let you go out tomorrow.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.360
-Why are you behaving like this?
-I don't want to hear it!

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.040
You have to rest all day tomorrow.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.760
Do whatever you want
in the evening.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800
-Ajit, this is a warning.
-Hmm?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.680
He better not stick to it.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.040
You get it, Doctor?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.240
I must go out tomorrow.
Prescribe something strong.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.440
Hmm.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.800
(chanting hymns)

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.160
-Come soon.
-Hmm.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.480
Byomkesh, Ajit.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.640
What was your aunt just doing, Nengti?

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.880
Labourers will come tomorrow.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.360
She's sprinkling holy
water to purify the house.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.000
I want to speak to everyone
in the house.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.400
Who do you want to start with?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.360
I don't feel...

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.480
too well.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.160
It's natural to catch a cold
around this time.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.040
How long have you been in this house?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.360
About four years.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.120
What were you doing since afternoon
the day Henna died?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.800
After sir left office at 3:30 p.m.
I left too.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.000
<i>I came home.</i>

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.760
Where was Henna at the time?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.160
I didn't really notice.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.440
Then after resting
for about an hour...

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.880
At 4:30 p.m...

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
<i>Chingri brought tea and snacks.</i>

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.440
<i>After eating...</i>

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.480
I went to the market at five p.m.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.920
<i>To buy some essentials...
shaving tools and all.</i>

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.080
Did you see anyone while leaving?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.240
<i>I saw Uday.</i>

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.080
Uday is a college student.
He's not supposed to be home at that time.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.520
He's not interested in studies.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.360
He often comes back home
from college.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800
What time did you return?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.560
What time was it...

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.320
Around six p.m.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.960
Then I kept the things in my room and...

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.200
<i>went to the garden...
I go for a walk every day.</i>

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.880
<i>That's where I saw it.</i>

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.000
<i>And I informed the police immediately.</i>

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.640
Hey...

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.800
Where--

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.040
Where is everyone?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.840
Hmm.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.680
Ravi, your boss goes to a secret place
every weekend.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.640
You honestly don't know where it is?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.000
No.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.240
Hmm.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.560
You don't know the phone number either?
You really don't know?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.080
I really don't.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.080
That's why I called the other number I had.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.120
You can trust me, Byomkesh.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.120
Boss has never shared any information.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.600
Have you never tried to find out
on your own?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.720
I'm just an employee.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.080
Why should I bother?

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.440
The fire in Henna's room last night
which burnt all the documents...

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.320
You stay right here
but strangely enough, you didn't realise?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.160
-Don't you think it's strange too?
-No.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.680
There's nothing strange about it.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.160
I don't get sleep as it is.
I have insomnia.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240
And after everything
that happened on Saturday...

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.680
I felt I wouldn't be able to sleep
so I wondered what to do.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.880
So...

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.240
I took sleeping pills.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.160
Do you take it every day?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
Only on days I'm mentally distressed.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.240
Hmm... distressed...

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.520
But this bottle of sleeping pills is full.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.240
What keys are these?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.520
I have the keys
to all the drawers and cabinets in office.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.400
And this lock?

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.920
What's this for?
Looks brand new.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.200
Yes, I bought it for my room.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.000
-You haven't used it yet?
-No, but now I will.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.480
-You will?
-Hmm.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.640
 Keep this too.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.960
Where's your hometown, Ravi?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.160
-Huh?
-Where are you from?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.840
Cumilla.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.640
-Didn't you know Henna Mullick from before?
-No.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.880
And her father, Kamal Mullick?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.480
-No.
-No...

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.160
So you know absolutely nothing
about Henna's Mullick's death.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.400
-That's what you mean, right?
-Hmm.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.000
Isn't it?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.360
I can share something
if you won't tell anyone.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.720
Go on, we won't tell anyone.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.120
That day, I saw...

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.200
<i>Henna embroidering a handkerchief.</i>

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.600
<i>Do you know who she was making it for?</i>

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.840
UDAY

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.880
<i>For Uday.</i>

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.680
Uday got a bundle of thread
for Henna.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.560
<i>And Henna used it
to make a handkerchief for him.</i>

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.000
<i>That means Uday and Henna
were quite intimate.</i>

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.880
And with Jugal?

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.720
Sorry, Byomkesh.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.440
Please don't ask me about this anymore.
If ma'am gets to know...

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.920
Hmm.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.160
Were you and Henna close, Ravi?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.560
I have no weakness
for women, Byomkesh.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.160
-You don't?
-No.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.480
-Doesn't, huh.
-Good to hear that.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.440
-Come, Ajit.
-Let's go.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.320
You're a very interesting person.
Goodbye.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.160
<i>"My rose...</i>

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.080
I hold you in my heart

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.160
But in turn, you tore my heart
With thorns.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.800
<i>I'm bleed heavily".</i>

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800
AVM PRODUCTIONS
GIRL

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.000
<i>"Paint your face with that blood".</i>

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.600
How is it?

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.880
Beautiful.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.080
Yes, what is it?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.320
Has your poetry
ever been published, Jugal?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.560
Not yet.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.960
But I want to.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.800
Please check if this is your writing.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.160
Yours, isn't it?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.120
That's what the handwriting
looks like.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Were you in love with Henna?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:25.960
<i>"My rose...</i>

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.800
I hold you in my heart

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.760
But in turn, you tore my heart
With thorns."

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.240
I don't know.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.480
As long as Henna was here...

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.520
she had me under a strange spell.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.280
-Now--
-That spell has broken.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.640
Good.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.720
It was you who threw the rose
through the window.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.640
CHITRABANI

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.000
<i>The day Henna died...</i>

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.440
what were you doing
since that afternoon, Jugal?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.520
My class had ended by two p.m. that day.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.240
After that...

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.000
I came home at around three p.m.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.080
<i>Then I fell asleep while reading a book.</i>

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.360
<i>I woke up at around 5:30 p.m...</i>

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.920
<i>Then I went to the garden and came back
to my room after about 15 minutes.</i>

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.680
<i>That's when Chingri brought me some snacks.</i>

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.040
You went to the garden at 5:30 p.m.
and you were there for 15 minutes.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.400
That means you were in the garden
at 5:45 p.m.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.920
Did you see Ravi Verma?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.080
No.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.480
In fact, I went to see Henna's body
 after I heard the commotion.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.520
M-Ma'am!

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.080
Come fast!

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.400
-Jugal...
-Hmm?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.200
Was Henna intimate with anyone--
I mean, anyone else, in this house?

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.120
No, she wasn't close to anyone else.
She didn't interact with anyone.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.480
The day Henna died,
the day I first came to this house...

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.760
your brother was accusing you
of Henna's murder.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.240
Why did he accuse you?

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.280
Uday is jealous of me.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.600
Hmm.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.360
That means Uday was attracted to Henna too.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.040
Who did Henna like better?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.640
Neither of us.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.960
That's what it seems like now.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.520
-Can we speak to your mother?
-Sure.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.920
<i>Why are you troubling us
for no reason?</i>

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.720
What do you want to know?
Make it quick.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Were you part of a violent rebel group
before marriage?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.160
Yes, so what?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.560
Non-violence--

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.760
You don't believe in non-violence, do you?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.720
No, I don't.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.200
Why aren't you on good terms
with Santosh?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.840
You believe that Henna Mullick
was Santosh's mistress, right?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.240
Yes.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.120
My husband is a man of bad character.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.840
What's your relationship
with Nengti and Chingri?

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.240
Their mother was my childhood friend.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.200
She was like family.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.800
I am not related to them by blood.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.160
How was your relationship
with Henna Mullick?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.160
Henna Mullick came to my house
six months ago.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.640
No, I had nothing to do with her.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.880
I never asked her to come up
to the first floor.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.200
Henna was not a good girl.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.880
Do you know why
Santosh brought Henna here?

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.240
No.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.800
Were you okay with it?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.880
No.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.840
Was there trouble between you
and Santosh over Henna?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.840
I'm not compelled to answer that.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.680
What are your sons like?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.480
Both are genuine people.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.160
They had nothing to do
with Henna.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.600
They don't interact
with that kind of a girl.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.560
Between five and six p.m
on the day of the murder...

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.640
where were you
and what were you doing?

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:22.840
I...

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.640
<i>was doing up Chingri's hair.</i>

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.520
<i>And Chingri combed my hair
after that.</i>

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.680
<i>Then I went for a bath.</i>

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720
Go.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.360
<i>Did you see Henna go up to the terrace?</i>

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
No.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.560
Did you hear any noises
from the terrace?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.720
No.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.600
Do you know why Henna went
to the terrace every day?

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.720
To smoke.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.600
I'd like to talk to Chingri once.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.360
Whatever you want to ask her,
do it in front of me.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.840
Okay.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.520
When Henna first came to this house...

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.960
I really liked her.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.640
I've never seen a more beautiful girl.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.080
Henna?

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.600
I came to make friends with you.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.080
I don't make friends with anyone.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.560
You can go now.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.440
But we'll be staying in the same house.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.640
How can we not be friends?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.400
I already told you
I don't make friends with anyone.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.360
I'm busy.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.120
Go now.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.320
<i>Didn't I tell you...</i>

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.920
not to talk to that girl?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.360
You still went?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.280
I'm sorry, Aunty.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.520
Chingri, did your uncle talk to Henna?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.240
Chingri?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.920
Would your uncle and Henna talk?

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.280
A few times...

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.400
She only spoke nicely to Uncle.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.200
Would Henna ever go out of the house?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.520
Yes.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.680
Every 10 or 12 days, she used to dress up
and go out somewhere.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.160
And she would be back in an hour.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.200
Why don't you go to school, Chingri?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.400
Aunty does not like it.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.960
Why?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.080
Girls who go to school become wayward.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.200
They learn to smoke.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.640
What were you doing between
five and six p.m. the day Henna died?

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.760
<i>First I went to give some snacks to Jugal.</i>

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.920
<i>Then I went to Uday's room.</i>

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.480
<i>Was Uday in his room
when you went there?</i>

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.440
<i>No, Uday was not in his room.</i>

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.360
Do you know when Henna went
to the terrace?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.440
No, I didn't see.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.520
<i>Right after my bath...</i>

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.120
<i>I heard a lot of screaming
so I ran downstairs.</i>

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.680
Chingri, what's your brother like?

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.960
He's a very good boy.
Why are you dragging him into all this?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.440
That's enough. Please leave now.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.960
Let's go.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.400
Why don't you study, Nengti?

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.920
Uncle said he'll give me a job
in his company when I'm 18.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.920
-So why waste my time studying?
-Yeah, right.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.200
-When has education ever brought success?
-Very good, very good.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.200
-We can say you're a handsome young boy.
-Yes.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.000
Did Henna pay any attention to you?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120
Huh?

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.000
Going out?

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.600
I am elder to you.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.000
Talk to me with respect.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.760
Hmmph!

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.120
Nengti.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.320
Did Henna pay any attention to you?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.880
-Me? No, I didn't.
-Hey!

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.440
Answer properly.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.840
What a brat!
Says he didn't pay heed to her!

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.000
Who did Henna talk to in this house?

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.960
Mostly with Uncle.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.320
Sometimes with Jugal, Uday.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.080
For all your fancy gestures now...

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.800
You couldn't even crawl
when you were little!

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.760
When did you next see me after that?

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.800
-After that... Now.
-Do you like this?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.280
Of course.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.120
You're at a ripe age, huh.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.440
And my mother?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.480
"My rose...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.360
I hold you in my heart.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.640
But in turn, you tore my heart
With thorns."

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.600
<i>What do you think, Nengti?</i>

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.720
Who could have killed Henna?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.440
Give me a cigarette.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.720
How do I know?

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.160
-You're a truth seeker, find out yourself.
-Huh?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.520
Nengti!

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.360
What's that club Uday goes to?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.720
Great Eastern Club.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.320
That scoundrel!

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600
-You're overindulging him, Byomkesh.
-So what if I am?

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.320
As long as it tempts the hidden
Mount Moinak to take a peek above water.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.200
Let's go.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.400
Can you excuse us?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.120
Sure.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.320
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.960
Ajit.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.280
We're disturbing your recreation.
Please don't mind.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.520
My whole life is recreation.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.360
So these trivial interruptions
don't bother me.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.040
The day Henna died...

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.680
What were you doing and where were you
from afternoon to evening that day?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.320
I was here in the afternoon.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.360
I went back home at around 4:30 p.m.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.240
<i>Then...</i>

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.440
<i>Then I went to my room...</i>

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.480
<i>Changed my clothes...</i>

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.640
<i>And then went to the hall.</i>

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.200
<i>Why did you go to the hall?</i>

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.720
I'm not answerable to you.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.040
It's my house.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.240
I can be wherever,
whenever I want.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.280
When you were in the hall...

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.480
did you see anyone else there?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.920
<i>Ravi Verma.</i>

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.840
<i>-Anyone else?
-Nengti.</i>

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.240
Give me a smoke.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.200
Hey, give me a smoke.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.960
Want me to tell Mother?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.400
Oh, then I'll also tell her
that you eat chicken at the club.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.640
Why do you even try?
Now give it to me.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.000
<i>When Henna was going out of the house...</i>

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.200
where were you?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.080
In the hall.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.560
<i>Oh, you're still in the hall.</i>

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.920
Did you and Henna have a chat?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.240
-No comment.
-What?

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.000
No comment.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.960
You and Henna...

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.920
were quite intimate.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.680
-No comment.
-Ah.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.720
How long were you in the hall
after Henna left?

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.760
Five minutes.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.560
Where did you go after that?

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.680
Back to my room.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.240
You should be going back too, now.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.840
I'm busy.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.840
You bought thread for Henna.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.800
To embroider a design.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.640
-What does that prove?
-That you and Henna were intimate.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.720
But you want to hide it.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.080
I feel you followed Henna
up to the terrace that day.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.280
Right?

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.680
Why did you murder Henna, Uday?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.280
-Listen.
-Yes?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.520
I did follow Henna to the terrace that day.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.360
<i>But she locked the door
before I reached the terrace.</i>

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.680
Say what you will, but you look like
someone who can murder Henna.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.680
I can't.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.160
We loved each other.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.920
Look, Uday.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.920
Henna wasn't in love with you.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.280
Just remember that Henna was the puppeteer
and you were the puppet.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.600
Okay?

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.200
Puppet?

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.080
Where to now?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.080
-I feel really drawn to Lord Krishna, Ajit.
-Huh?

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.000
Let's take His name and dive
into the waters of River Kalyamuna.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.240
Sure.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.880
(singing devotional song)

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.280
I really liked your song.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.200
I am Byomkesh Bakshi.
I'm just a truth seeker.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.240
-And this is my friend Ajit Bandopadhyay.
-Ajit Bandopadhyay.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.640
-It was wonderful!
-Thank you.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.760
I got your address from Santosh.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.880
I know.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.920
He called to let me know.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.400
Did you know that he'd given shelter
to a girl called Henna Mullick?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.160
He took in his friend's orphaned daughter.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.800
I knew about it.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.440
Sukumari, I know how close
you and Santosh are.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.440
Please don't hesitate in front of me.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.880
The day Henna Mullick died,
you and Santosh were...

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.720
at your secret house.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.680
Please tell me everything
that happened since that afternoon.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.800
Why should I hesitate?

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.160
It's a matter of pride for me.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.840
Look, Santosh is a respectable man...

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.040
-That's why this is confidential.
-It will remain confidential, rest assured.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.680
Very well.
Listen, then.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.800
We call it our "little home".

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.640
<i>That day, at about two p.m.
I finished my work here and went there.</i>

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.920
<i>It was nearly three o'clock
by the time I was done cleaning.</i>

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.760
<i>Then, he came.</i>

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.600
<i>He has a habit of reading
after his bath.</i>

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.440
<i>After that, cooked some food.</i>

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.920
<i>He just doesn't want to eat
outside food, you see.</i>

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.000
<i>After that, I started my singing.</i>

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.560
(singing devotional song)

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.080
<i>After some time, at around eight p.m.
we received a phone call.</i>

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.280
What's the matter?

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.560
What?

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.600
I have to leave immediately.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.040
Come with me.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.720
<i>Who called?</i>

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.920
My teacher.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.960
You are her guardian?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.800
Yes, I trained her in music.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.320
You know where Santosh and Sukumari's
secret house is?

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.440
-No.
-No!

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.000
I don't know that.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.800
Sukumari has only given me
the phone number.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.400
And I don't call
unless it's very important.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.040
Who called you?

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.800
Santosh's secretary.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.080
He asked me to inform Santosh.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.200
Then I called to let him know.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.160
Tell me...

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.600
Very well.
Thank you.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.600
Huh?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.840
Goodbye.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.960
Hmmph!

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.960
Your mind is not in the game today.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Rather, tell us what you're thinking about.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.840
I don't think it was an inside job, Satya.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.520
Why do you say that?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.000
This Uday.
He's very suspicious.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.000
That proves nothing.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.120
Maybe Henna really...

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.640
I mean, maybe she really did fall
off the terrace.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.240
Maybe the police is right.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.640
Why were the documents
in her room burnt, then?

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.800
Then I can think of only one person.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.280
-The mouth organ player.
-Good. But who is he?

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.080
And why would he kill Henna?
What's his motive?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.240
Hello?

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.680
Byomkesh, I am Chameli Samaddar.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.120
No, you see--

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160
<i>I want to tell you...</i>

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.200
Your suspicions are completely wrong.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.720
<i>My sons did not kill Henna.</i>

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.400
They're honest.
Unlike their father.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.640
Henna fainted and
fell off the terrace.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.000
This is Ajit Bandopadhyay.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.760
Hung up.
It was Chameli.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.680
She claims that...

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.760
her sons are not murderers.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.640
Henna fell off the terrace and died.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.040
This is very natural for Chameli.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.760
Chameli is the anxious sort.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.200
She's very protective about her sons.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.880
She could be saying this
to protect them.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.160
Doesn't she know
that the police has closed the case?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.160
No, I asked AK Ray not to tell her.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.520
But what's interesting is...

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.240
Santosh knows the case is closed
but he hasn't told anyone.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.880
Do you suspect Santosh?

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.120
I suspect everyone.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.360
-I'd even suspect you if you'd been there.
-Just look at him!

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.760
And what about Nengti?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.000
I would suspect him too...

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.960
if he hadn't been the one to call me.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400
Chingri?

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.600
Certainly.
Chingri loves Jugal.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.680
-Henna's rival?
-This is her motive...

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.920
and she had ample opportunity to kill too.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.240
How could that happen because...

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.080
Uday said Henna locked the door
when she went to the terrace.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.880
It's also possible that Chingri
was already hiding in the terrace.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.520
<i>The same logic applies
to Chameli as well.</i>

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.840
<i>She believes that her husband and Henna
were in an illicit relationship.</i>

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.280
<i>Are you absolutely sure
this is a murder?</i>

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.120
Two hundred per cent.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.360
Who else do you suspect?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.560
Let's talk about Santosh Samaddar first.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.080
He's a great man
but he has a serious character flaw.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.720
He gave shelter to his dead friend's
beautiful daughter in his house.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.560
Is this merely a selfless act
of friendship?

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.360
No but...

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.120
he must have some motive.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.040
Santosh's motive...

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.600
Do I have to say it all?
Rack your own brains.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.040
Could Henna be blackmailing Santosh
about Sukumari?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.280
Henna is from Pakistan.
She isn't supposed to know about Sukumari.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.440
What if she somehow came to know?

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.760
Why would Santosh keep Henna
in his house then?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.160
And why would he care about blackmail?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.720
Hmm...

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.840
You know, Satyabati...

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.040
Everyone at home
knows about his character.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.320
But they never say a word about it.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.000
Hence, Santosh has no reason
to fear Henna.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.280
-You're right. He has an alibi.
-Sukumari has the same alibi.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.160
Santosh and Sukumari share alibis
just like they share love for one another.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.800
Do you suspect Sukumari?

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.440
Maybe she had little opportunity
but her motive was strong.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.520
Santosh Samaddar gives her a lot of money
every month.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.880
Maybe she even loves Santosh.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.320
Maybe Henna was becoming a rival for her.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.400
Hmm.
Who's next?

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.320
Ravi Verma.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.880
Ravi Verma.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.560
That man...

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.360
He's like an eel.
Slips out if you try to catch him.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.880
I believe Ravi Verma knew
Henna Mullick from before.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.000
And he was both attracted to
and repelled by Henna.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.280
It's natural to be attracted to her.
Unmarried man and such a beautiful girl...

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.680
But what could he find repulsive?

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.200
He's a strange man...

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.200
Perhaps Henna knew some secrets
about Ravi Verma...

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.840
Or it's possible that...

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.760
He's a strange-looking man.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.920
Maybe he wanted to get close to Henna
but she didn’t pay any attention to him.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.680
Maybe she mocked him
and he's blaming Uday to take revenge.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.880
-Blame it on Uday?
-Actively!

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.360
When I was interrogating him,
I didn't ask him.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.400
He said it himself, about that...

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.640
-Uday bringing thread for Henna...
-Yes, yes, the threads.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.000
Right, right.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.560
And Uday?

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.840
I think Henna did indulge Uday
a little too much.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.600
And you know what Uday's like, Satya?

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.240
He's stupid and handsome.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.440
He probably thought that Henna loves him.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.000
But maybe later...

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.280
Uday came to know.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.120
<i>That Henna has trapped him.</i>

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.280
You and Jugal are reading poetry together,
exchanging roses...

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.960
You think I don't know?

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.280
It's nothing like that.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.480
I didn't do anything--

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.880
<i>-And Jugal?
-Same motive.</i>

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.880
Sexual jealousy.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.920
On the surface, Jugal looks like...

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.960
a passive, poetic kind of person.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.040
<i>But we don't know
what's hidden in his heart.</i>

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.880
He threw in a rose through the window.
Would he murder her?

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.880
<i>That might have been to mislead the police.</i>

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.280
<i>It's possible that it happened later.</i>

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.040
<i>And before that, Jugal was hiding
on the terrace.</i>

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.320
Treating us all like puppets?

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.640
Sewing handkerchiefs for Uday?

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.200
Listen--

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.800
<i>Then he quickly went down
and kept the rose to mislead the police.</i>

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.240
CHITRABANI

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.600
<i>Then the question is...</i>

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.520
<i>Out of seven people,
who is the real culprit?</i>

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.480
<i>Uday?</i>

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.160
<i>Jugal?</i>

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.160
<i>Ravi Verma?</i>

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.720
<i>Chameli?</i>

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.160
<i>Nengti?</i>

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.160
<i>Chingri?</i>

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.680
<i>Or Santosh himself?</i>

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.520
There's another hidden suspect.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.040
-The flute player?
-Hmm.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.000
Who could this Casanova be?

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.400
I'm sure it's someone from Pakistan.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.840
Maybe he was Henna's lover.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.920
He would sometimes bring books
for Henna from Pakistan.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.160
Then for some reason,
they have conflicts...

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.960
the love gradually turns into poison...

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.240
Maybe because Henna was interested in Uday.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.600
That man...

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.280
comes every 10 or 12 days.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.800
I asked Nengti.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.360
Whether he came after Henna's death
but Nengti said he did not.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.480
He didn't...

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.440
Why didn't he?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.800
Maybe he got the news of Henna's death.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.880
Or maybe he's unwell or...

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.600
dead.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.360
Dead?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.440
What?

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.520
Ajit, the day Henna Mullick died...

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.760
do you remember that day?

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.360
Why wouldn't I?

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.840
Are you talking
about something in particular?

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.720
The Pakistan Airlines tragedy.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.160
