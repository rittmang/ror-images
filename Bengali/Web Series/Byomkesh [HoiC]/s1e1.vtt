WEBVTT

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.500
Doctor...

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:27.333
they are writing all these articles about
cocaine hubs and drug smuggling in this area.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.708
Do you believe it?

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:33.166
It's not that I don't believe it.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:39.291
I have been getting hints
every now and then.

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:44.416
Some of them have come to
me for prescription drugs.

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:52.375
Those who are cocaine addicts can't
hide their addiction from a doctor.

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:56.583
Ok, so they are doing drugs.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.500
But why the murders?

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:02.500
They are very closely related.

00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.916
For example...

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:05.833
Suppose, I am a cocaine dealer...

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.708
And you have found out
about my business...

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:15.416
In such a situation, will it be wise for me
to keep you alive?

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.208
You might go tell the police, right?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.041
And land me at jail?

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:24.666
Even then, do you think I'll
keep you alive?

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:32.500
Looks like you have really understood the
the thought process of criminals very minutely.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:39.083
See, Mr. Ajit, It's a good deed
to give a home to a homeless...

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:42.500
But, I have warned you that
tears of strangers are only water...

00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.958
No no. I do not believe that Mr. Atul
has done this.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.208
It'll be decided after
the court's verdict...

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.041
But...

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.041
See, Doctor...

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.332
He is a young man, looking for a job.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.707
He has no place to take shelter.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.083
My room is pretty big...

00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.957
That's why I had agreed to
stay with him.

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.833
But the man is never at home, isn't it?

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:07.291
Do you know what kind of job he had?

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.416
What would he do! The problems
of being unemployed.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.833
He used to wake up and leave to
hunt for a job.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.333
The entire day he used to go here and
there... Asking around in offices.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.958
You do know what the situation with
jobs are like here.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.434
At night, maybe he used to go looking
for a job as a night guard.

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:23.375
These are very dark times.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.124
Atul Babu, you're here?

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.125
Weren't you arrested?

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.458
A cop is deadlier than a tiger...

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:38.458
What happened Ghanashyam!
Oh, Ghanashyam! Wait!

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.582
Atul Babu, you are back?
The police let you go?

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:44.666
Yes, Doctor.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.833
There's a proverb in English, isn't it?

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:48.791
"Bad Penny"

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.750
Even I came back as rejected.

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:57.207
Even the police did not take me.

00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:59.416
No, it's actually good
that you've come back.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.874
That is very good.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.375
But for me... you know...

00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.874
No no. Absolutely, I understand.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.165
I hope you understand.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:07.875
It's true.

00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:12.708
You might get involved in aiding and abetting
case, if you give shelter to a criminal like me.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.290
So, do I need to vacate by tonight?

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.083
No no. You can stay tonight.

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.208
But, tomorrow morning
you will have to...

00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:27.791
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.708
Ajit!

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:41.083
Call Mr. Anukul!

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:44.083
This is the problem with
these locks, understand?

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.291
It just cannot be fixed
once there is a problem.

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:50.416
Here take it. I'll call the carpenter
tomorrow and get it fixed, ok?

00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:52.083
All right, Doctor.

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.333
Come in.

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:19.500
Doctor...

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:22.500
I have come to test the
benefits of your medicines.

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:25.625
I have a splitting headache.
Can you give me anything?

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.041
Yes, sure.

00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:32.875
You have a headache because of you
haven't eaten anything, understood?

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.707
Here, have this. You will be
fine by tomorrow morning.

00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:38.583
All right.

00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:43.958
Mr. Ajit... You don't look too
well either.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:48.875
You look weak after all the excitement.
Your body is giving up, is it?

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:51.833
Wait.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.791
You...

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.041
take this.

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:02.583
You take this. You will feel
a lot better tomorrow morning.

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.083
All right, Doctor.
We'll take leave.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.500
Namoshkar!

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.332
Doctor, have you heard of anyone named
Byomkesh Bakshi?

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:20.832
No. Who is he?

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.833
Even I do not know.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.375
I heard his name at the police station.

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.457
He's the one who is
investigating this murder.

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:29.458
Doctor...

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:34.083
Bye. Good night.

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:54.375
Hey! What is the matter!

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:58.500
Stay a little longer in this darkness...

00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:01.708
light will illuminate from here itself.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.791
But... light?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.375
You mean...

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.207
Light will come from the
source of darkness?

00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:10.250
That itself is your light!

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:12.040
That's good.

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.916
For now, let there be darkness.

00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:11.416
It's a very sad story, Doctor...

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:15.333
A professional like you, stabbing a pillow?

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.125
Don't move! Don't you dare move!
Ajit! Ajit!

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.750
Take the knife from his hand.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.750
What?

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:12.915
What is my crime?

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:15.000
There's more than one, Doctor.

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:16.833
Cocaine business..

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.875
Murder...

00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:24.082
Do you have any proof that
I have a cocaine business?

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.124
Yes, sure I do.

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:28.833
Your medicine boxes from abroad...

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.500
Am I wrong?

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:33.000
Tell me something, Doctor.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:36.666
What medicine did you
give us tonight?

00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:39.458
Morphine. Isn't that right?

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:44.665
The charge sheet for your crimes is being
prepared at the police station.

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:46.875
But for now...

00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:52.666
I arrest you for attempting to murder
Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.750
Inspector, do you have
a matchbox?

00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:10.665
No matter how dried garlic may get...
It never loses its flavor.

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:13.750
Remember Mr. Detective.

00:10:18.666 --> 00:10:21.416
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ajit.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.833
Satyanweshi?????

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.625
You know.. I don't like the sound
of the term "Detective"...

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:37.708
and "investigator" is even worse.

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.249
That's why I've given myself the name...

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.375
"Truth Seeker"

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.000
Come in... come in.

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:46.583
Welcome! Welcome to the house
of the poor.

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:48.208
Hey Putiram!

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.373
Get a cup of hot tea and
some kachoris (Flatbread).

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.333
Your house looks very nice!

00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:01.875
- So I take it that you live alone.
- Yes, Putiram being my sole companion.

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:05.416
Ajit, didn't you say you were a writer?

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.040
Is that your professional calling?

00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:11.416
How could I resist the urge
to make a profession out of my passion?

00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:15.166
The interest on my inheritance
is enough for a bachelor's life like mine.

00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:20.958
Hence, I have embraced celibacy
and devoted me to a literary life.

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:24.290
Now that I know where you
live, I will take my leave!

00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:26.333
Wait! I just sent Putiram
to bring hot kachoris.

00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.666
That can wait, it's already
very late now. Goodbye.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:33.624
Listen Ajit, after what's happened
in that house,

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.425
I don't think you will
be able to live there.

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:38.416
Why don't you move in here?
This house isn't so bad after all.

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:43.707
- Are you returning the favor?
- Haha, not exactly a favor.

00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:47.708
I have a feeling I will be
needing you more from now on.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.800
Enjoying your company
has become a bad habit!

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.708
- I have one condition.
- Tell me.

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:55.708
I want to take all the mysterious
incidents and cases that you solve,

00:12:55.916 --> 00:13:00.750
add a little color to them
and publish them as fiction. Agree?

00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:02.833
Hmm...

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:10.124
Look, I don't really see any
reason to object to this.

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:14.790
And as you know very well,
the desire for popularity...

00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:17.625
is indomitable.

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.375
- You don't say!
- But I am.

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:29.499
Hey, where are you rushing off to again?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.165
Let me bring my belongings!
- Okay, don't forget to bring mine!

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:35.249
I won't. I will be back for
lunch in the afternoon!

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.791
Okay, see you soon!

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.791
Nomoshkaar! (Goodbye)

00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:49.208
- Babu, have you thrown away the faulty
pins kept at the back of the shop?

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.250
No, why?

00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:55.708
I can't find them anywhere.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.583
Good riddance, it was rubbish anyway.

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:10.082
Gramophone pin! Yet again!

00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:13.374
Gramophone pin murders continue!

00:15:13.375 --> 00:15:15.041
Gramphone pin! Yet again!

00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:17.458
The strange murders using
gramophone pins continue!

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:23.666
Breaking and fresh news regarding
the gramophone pin murders!

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:27.207
Breaking and fresh news regarding
the gramophone pin murders!

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:30.375
Read them in the papers! Take! Read
about the gramophone pin killings!

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.708
Byomkesh! Again!

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.500
Are you listening to me? LISTEN!

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.582
Another murder by a gramophone pin.

00:16:02.583 --> 00:16:06.499
"Readers may be aware that a few days ago,
Jaihari Sanyal was walking when

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.333
he suddenly fell to his own death.

00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:12.833
We surmised then that a massive
conspiracy may be lurking behind this.

00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:15.541
That suspicion has now been confirmed.

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:19.083
With the incidence of another
ghastly murder yesterday.

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:23.500
Last evening, famous and wealthy
businessman, Kailash Chandra Moulick...

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:30.833
It is clear that it is not a mere accident.

00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:34.375
A group of sinister barbaric murderers
has taken over the entire city.

00:16:34.416 --> 00:16:36.832
It is difficult to ascertain
their identities or their motive.

00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:41.249
What is strange, is there
weapon and modus operandi-

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.458
Give me the advertisement page for a bit. - You want
to read the ads when there's a murderer on the loose?

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.915
Have you noticed an interesting ad
in the papers for the last few days?

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:50.556
I don't really follow the advertisements.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.207
You don't read the ads in newsppaers?
Then what do you read?

00:16:54.208 --> 00:16:56.540
What the newspapers are meant for. News.

00:16:56.541 --> 00:17:02.082
Who cut his finger in Manchuria and who delivered
triplets in Brazil, this is what you read?

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:07.625
Listen Ajit, if you want real news,
start reading the ad section.

00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:11.957
Oh really? The reporters
these days must be very sly.

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:17.207
Instead of publishing more advertisements,
they are wasting pages on this gibberish.

00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:21.041
If they can't satisfy people like you,
they won't be selling their papers anyway.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.958
-Oh really?
-The real news is in the ad pages.

00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:29.083
All that is happening in the country,

00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:34.041
who's selling what in order to
rob people in broad daylight,

00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:39.500
or who is planning to
smuggle stolen goods, -

00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:44.875
news like these appears only in
the ad section. Like this one.

00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:53.624
"Thorns on the Road"
If you want to rid the road of thorns,

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:56.957
at 5:30 PM on Saturday,
wait at Dharmatala Tram Depot...

00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:02.375
by the lamp post next to the tram
line on the southwest end.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:06.165
This ad has been appearing every
Friday for the last three months.

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:08.832
But..what is the point
of this cryptic message?

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:10.791
There has to be some reason

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:15.458
No one spends so much on
ads without any reason.

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:20.916
However Mr.Writer, one thing
is clear from all this.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.750
What is that?
- His insistence on anonymity.

00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:32.208
Whoever he is, he wishes to call
the shots from behind the scene.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.791
I am not sure I follow you.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.958
Let's assume you have a thorn on your path, and
you want to get rid of it. What do you do?

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:45.915
You stand at the specified spot and
wait, holding the lamp post.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:50.540
You go and wait by the lamp post
like an idiot for half an hour

00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:55.375
but nobody appears with the noble aim
of eliminating your thorns for you

00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:59.006
You get irritated and give up,
thinking the entire matter is just a ruse

00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:00.041
At that precise moment...

00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:10.874
And that's how a relationship based on transaction
is established between the two of you

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:14.083
But his identity, and how he looks...

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.875
You know nothing of it.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.583
No Byomkesh, your theory
sounds preposterous.

00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:41.000
Disbelieving whatever is beyond your comprehension
only reveals your own weakness, Ajit.

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.125
Very well, tomorrow is a Saturday.

00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:45.000
There isn't much work in the evening

00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:46.875
I will prove it to you then.

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:49.708
How exactly?

00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.000
Putiram!

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:05.291
Old... plump... and stout...

00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:11.250
With a walking stick in hand,
expecting to meet us...

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:14.945
Because there's no one living on
the third floor except us.

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.083
Come in!

00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:32.500
Which amongst you is
Detective Byomkesh Bakshi?

00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:35.416
That would be me...

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:37.375
But I am no detective.

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:39.208
I prefer "Truth-Seeker".

00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:44.083
Why don't you make yourself comfortable? Then
we can listen to your gramophone pin mystery.

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:49.416
H...how on earth did you know?

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.375
Just a guess.

00:20:53.541 --> 00:20:54.708
First of all, your age...

00:20:56.041 --> 00:20:57.875
Secondly, you look well off,

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:02.416
Thirdly, you are in some trouble which
has brought you to our doorstep.

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:07.582
I-I...

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:10.708
was looking for you because I mean...

00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:13.958
I was thinking of you

00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:17.085
Now I am convinced I have
come to the right place.

00:21:17.708 --> 00:21:20.249
Mr. Byomkesh, you alone can save me!

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.708
I expect nothing from the
police, they are useless!

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.999
Can you imagine, in broad daylight.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.582
there have been five murders already!

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:31.623
I was almost on the verge
of getting killed me!

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:35.415
Tell me everything from the start
without keeping anything back.

00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:37.957
I am Ashutosh Mitra.

00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:40.708
I live nearby, at Lebutala.

00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:47.291
I have been traveling a lot for
business, ever since I was 18

00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:50.708
which left me with very little
opportunity to settle down.

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:55.708
However, I was not really
interested in marriage anyway

00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:03.000
I am essentially very self-contained.
I like living by myself...

00:22:04.416 --> 00:22:11.375
However, it has been two years
since I retired from work.

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:14.915
All my life earnings,

00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:21.082
say around 1.5 lakhs have
been deposited in the bank.

00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:23.958
That is all I have, that is what I live on.

00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:27.707
Besides this, I-I...

00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:31.500
am fond of listening to music

00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:35.666
This is how I passed my time,
life was peacefully passing me by

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:37.250
Anyone living with you?

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:43.958
No relatives as such except
for a nuisance of a nephew

00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:48.000
who comes by often to ask
for monetary allowances.

00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:54.208
Mr. Byomkesh, I cannot tolerate these
the spendthrift and alcoholic gamblers at all!

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:55.541
What does this nephew do?

00:22:56.791 --> 00:23:02.207
I don't let that scoundrel in my house!

00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:03.583
Where does he live?

00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:09.041
He is now in lockup, the police have
arrested him on counts of public drinking

00:23:09.583 --> 00:23:13.708
which is why the last two
months were peaceful for me

00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.750
Then?
- What do you think?

00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:24.458
I was doing pretty well while he
was in jail, but Mr. Byomkesh

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.458
my entire world turned upside
down without any warning sign.

00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:53.166
Thank god for my pocket watch,
I owe it my life!

00:23:55.750 --> 00:24:03.750
The fear and worry it put me through all night
may have reduced my lifespan by ten years

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.666
I had heard about you,
so I rushed here as soon as I could.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.000
I came by car, I am so shaken
that I couldn't brave walking here.

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:20.165
Mr. Ashutosh, you can relax.

00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:26.958
If you follow my instructions, I can assure
you that no harm will come your way.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.666
Mr. Byomkesh, please save
me from this grave danger.

00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:36.999
I promise you a reward of 1000 rupees.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.791
(To himself) One thousand?
Great! That comes to 3 grand in total.

00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:50.082
Anyway, Mr. Ashutosh?

00:24:50.083 --> 00:24:53.624
Tell me something. When you felt
the blow on your chest yesterday,

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.915
do you remember hearing a
distinct sound at that moment?

00:24:56.916 --> 00:24:59.249
A sound?
- Yes, anything that stands out

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.458
For instance, something like
the sound of a tire puncture

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.208
Uh... no, I don't think so
- Then perhaps a different sort of sound?

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.833
Mr. Byomkesh, I cannot recall a thing - Try,
Mr. Ashutosh, try to remember what you heard

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:17.082
Try and think, some sort of street noise

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:25.083
Uh... general noise of automobiles plying on
road..uh... - Which of these sounds exactly?

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:33.333
That reminds me, Mr.Byomkesh, when
I felt the ache near my chest

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:40.041
I did hear a bicycle bell at that moment

00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:46.041
Bicycle bell... Okay,
any other unusual sound?

00:25:47.708 --> 00:25:48.708
Uh... no.

00:25:52.666 --> 00:25:55.583
Mr. Ashutosh, can you think of any
enemy who might want to kill you?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.333
No no...

00:25:58.541 --> 00:26:03.833
You never married right? So you
don't have any children...

00:26:04.708 --> 00:26:07.916
Who is the beneficiary of your will?
Your nephew?

00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:10.666
Have you made a will yet?

00:26:13.458 --> 00:26:17.499
Yes, but my inheritance
doesn't go to my nephew

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.166
Not your nephew... Who then?

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:30.374
Nevermind. But, whoever that may be...

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:33.583
does he/she know about this will?
- No.

00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:37.375
No one except my lawyer
and I know about it.

00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:41.166
Do you see or meet up with
the beneficiary often?

00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:08.166
Byomkesh, why did you warn Ashutosh against
leaving the house or frequenting the streets?

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:14.250
Ajit, you must have noticed one thing
regarding the gramophone pin affair.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.416
All the murders took place
in the middle of the road.

00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:22.208
Not anywhere else, not
even on the pavement.

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.625
Can you think of a reason?

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:30.125
What is it Byomkesh?
- There can be two reasons for this...

00:27:30.583 --> 00:27:35.500
First, the streets are always crowded which makes it
easier for the perpetrator to mingle and slip away

00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:40.457
Or, the weapon that was used...
cannot be deployed from-

00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:42.125
Ajit! Look out!

00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:46.583
I forgot where I was
for a moment...

00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:53.166
What was saying back there?
- Weapon...

00:27:55.791 --> 00:28:00.124
Byomkesh, what kind of
weapon could it be...

00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:05.000
The day we discover that, the gramophone pin
mystery would no longer remain a mystery

00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:09.916
It cannot be guns or pistols...

00:28:12.083 --> 00:28:16.791
The noise they create cannot
be masked by street noise.

00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:21.500
Besides, the smell of gunpowder lingers.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.416
Sound is disguised by other sounds.

00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:27.915
Where does the smell go?

00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:30.791
How come this noise goes unnoticed?

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:35.124
You said it yourself, disguised by other
sounds- - Hey Ajit, listen listen!

00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:36.125
Tell me.

00:28:38.833 --> 00:28:40.333
No no no...

00:28:45.458 --> 00:28:46.625
A sound...

00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:53.207
Ajit, for each of the
gramophone pin murders...

00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:55.408
there is one strange thing in common.
Have you noticed?

00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:58.375
There is?
- Hmm

00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:04.375
Like what? - First, all the victims
are past their prime of youth,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.125
Mr. Ashutosh is elderly as well...
Secondly, all of them are pretty well off,

00:29:12.291 --> 00:29:17.416
Thirdly, each of them was murdered in
the streets, with lots of eyewitnesses.

00:29:19.041 --> 00:29:22.416
Lastly and most importantly,

00:29:24.083 --> 00:29:26.375
all of them are childless and heirless.

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:31.582
So you assume-
- I haven't assumed anything yet.

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:34.303
These are what I will base my assumptions
on, also known as "premise".

00:29:34.458 --> 00:29:39.500
But you'll need more than these to apprehend
the culprits- - Not culprits, ONE culprit.

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:46.000
The newspapers may have everyone convinced
of a "murderers' gang" but I am certain...

00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:49.333
There is only one mastermind behind this.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.291
How can you be so sure of this?

00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:58.833
Not everyone will be able to achieve the
target I have set for this murderer

00:30:00.416 --> 00:30:05.208
In the Mahabharat as well, only
Arjun could pierce the fish's eye

00:30:12.208 --> 00:30:15.458
He is our culprit...

00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:24.208
Ittick and George Mann

00:30:25.833 --> 00:30:28.041
he is like the omnipresent Brahma

00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:32.083
The one and the only

00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:13.666
My Queen Victoria! Hehehe!
- Go away!

00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:26.291
Hey Mister! Don't you want to come with me?

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.083
Moyna isn't the only one who can
enchant you, Bilasini knows it too!

00:31:40.625 --> 00:31:43.291
Open your eyes and at
least look at me once!

00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:48.625
Youth and beauty can be
located here as well!

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:57.291
Can you sing like Moyna though?

00:32:09.583 --> 00:32:12.582
You seem to be besotted with Moyna!

00:32:12.583 --> 00:32:14.874
Hahaha, you might as well forget about her.

00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:18.625
That broad is Mr. Ashutosh's mistress!

00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:25.458
What good fortune too! Her charms seem to
have cast a magic spell on the man!

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.499
She probably knows voodoo or something!

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:43.500
Besides the usual payment, he showers
her with jewelry all the time!

00:32:44.291 --> 00:32:48.332
That dunce would write off all his
inheritance to her if he could!

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:52.791
Damn! I wish I had a man like that!

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.041
Then I wouldn't have to
solicit imbeciles like you

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.333
Do you want a paan (betel leaf)?

00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.625
Since you're offering!

00:33:16.083 --> 00:33:19.833
So Byomkesh, the old man seems to be
brimming with passion huh?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.874
So, did you catch a
glimpse of this seductress?

00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:23.916
Lucida Grande

00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:34.291
How does she look? -Let's not get a celibate like
you unnecessarily excited with that description

00:33:35.875 --> 00:33:36.916
Then let's drop it.

00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:47.624
So, did you get any clues from the pocket watch?
- Nothing of import but one thing is clear

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:52.041
the distance between the murderer and victim
could not have been more than 7-8 gauges

00:33:52.916 --> 00:33:57.749
because a gramophone pin is so light
that is thrown from a greater distance

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.790
it wouldn't reach its desired bull's eye

00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:03.666
And we have seen how accurate the
murder's aim has been so far

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:10.250
Imagine, what if the murderer goes about with an
unassuming device that shoots gramophone pins

00:34:10.541 --> 00:34:13.958
and fires it whenever the
prey is in close proximity

00:34:17.875 --> 00:34:21.333
How about that? - This is not one of
your Bot-Tawla (a local trope) stories

00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:25.928
In that case, he could have conducted his activity
from the pavement; why step on to the road?

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.332
And I don't know of any
such an instrument or device

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:35.958
which when fired can pierce the human body
and punch a hole into his heart

00:34:37.416 --> 00:34:39.875
Have you realized how much
of power that requires?

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.458
Uh..you are probably right Byomkesh.
Also, it looks like it's going to rain.

00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:49.375
The solution keeps evading me, Ajit.

00:34:50.708 --> 00:34:53.541
It's slipping out of my grasp
every time I try to decipher it...

00:34:56.583 --> 00:34:58.875
Then what next?

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:11.250
So, Byomkesh, why did you become
curious about Mr. Ashutosh's secret life?

00:35:11.791 --> 00:35:14.416
Inexplicable curiosity
is my weakness, Ajit.

00:35:15.541 --> 00:35:17.375
So what were you curious about?

00:35:17.791 --> 00:35:20.083
The beneficiary of Mr. Ashutosh's will.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Her?!

00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:29.083
Just a guess.

00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:34.375
One cannot forget what happened yesterday.
- What are you referring to?

00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:37.958
Thorns of the road? That must
be verified, don't you think?

00:35:38.125 --> 00:35:41.458
Pah! Your guess is completely
wrong on this one, I am sure

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:43.958
I would like to test this theory.

00:36:58.708 --> 00:37:00.707
I haven't done anything!
There's nothing on me!

00:37:00.708 --> 00:37:02.166
Give me your letter.

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:09.958
Banerjee, why are you so scared?
- What is the point of this tomfoolery?

00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:15.958
The thorn slipped away
by a whisker, didn't it?

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.499
Listen, you better be on your way home.
And one more thing,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.707
Don't go home straight, take a detour

00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:30.125
Roam the entire circumference of the city before
heading home, got it. -I see you've smartened up

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:10.290
"Put the letter in an envelope;
next Sunday on 10th March...

00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:15.332
at 12 AM, take the road by Khiddirpur
Race Course and walk westward.

00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:19.708
You will see a man on a
bicycle come towards you

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:26.583
A man on a bicycle will come towards you...

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:33.833
A man on a bicycle will come towards you

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.250
Mr. Byomkesh!
- Mr. Ashutosh, what's the matter?

00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:43.083
My lawyer has fled abroad!

00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:45.500
Along with your friend from
Jorasanko, am I right?

00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:50.291
Y-yes... Y-you know everything about it?

00:38:50.416 --> 00:38:52.707
Everything, Mr.Ashutosh.
I know all about it.

00:38:52.708 --> 00:38:57.500
I had gone to Jorasanko yesterday and there
I met Binod, with that woman...

00:38:58.416 --> 00:39:03.583
They had been conspiring behind your back for a long
time and you never got a whiff of it, not at all...

00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:08.333
Shortly after he made you will, Binod paid a
visit Jorasanko to meet your beneficiary

00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:12.875
Perhaps out of curiosity at first, but then
what usually follows in such cases

00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:21.082
But Binod failed to anticipate
one thing, Mr. Ashutosh

00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:23.665
In the drama orchestrated by him,

00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:31.375
a small role will be played on stage...
by Byomkesh Bakshi

00:39:32.958 --> 00:39:35.458
Come if you want to, or go somewhere el-

00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:41.750
Oh, Mr. Lawyer, wait up!

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.708
Mr. Binod, I will leave no stone unturned until I solve
the truth behind the attempt on Mr. Ashutosh's life.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.541
Nomoshkaar. (Goodbye)

00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:17.540
Who is he?
- Mr. Lawyer!

00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:21.290
Oh!
- My landlord is a lecherous man

00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:24.999
He keeps following me around

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.208
I complained to Mr. Lawyer. That
should show him his right place!

00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:35.083
This lawyer comes here often, doesn't he?
- Yes yes-

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.458
But why are you snooping
around so much? Hmm?

00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:03.791
Mr. Ashutosh, if you think about it, this
has turned out well for you actually

00:41:05.416 --> 00:41:08.957
You escaped the conspiracy of a dishonest
woman and corrupt friend, unscathed

00:41:08.958 --> 00:41:14.708
There is no immediate danger to your life;
you may walk the streets without any fear

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
What do you mean?

00:41:18.083 --> 00:41:22.375
You know very well what it means,
you simply refuse to believe it

00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:26.791
They had conspired to get you murdered,
in order to claim your inheritance

00:41:26.916 --> 00:41:29.208
You know, Mr. Byomkesh

00:41:30.458 --> 00:41:38.208
I had abstained from all vices...
for 38 years

00:41:39.583 --> 00:41:41.791
But then suddenly...

00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:44.333
Came my downfall...

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.125
I met her at Deogarh...

00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:54.875
I was instantly captivated by her beauty,

00:41:55.916 --> 00:41:58.208
A whore, after all...

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:01.125
So I could not marry her.

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:04.250
But I couldn't really leave her either...

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.125
You know already, Mr. Byomkesh

00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:13.875
I had given her my all...

00:42:15.458 --> 00:42:19.833
You know, I... saw her as my wife

00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:26.333
I thought she considers
me her husband too...

00:42:29.666 --> 00:42:34.833
Anyway, I have learned a
a lesson in this old age...

00:42:36.541 --> 00:42:43.707
Mr. Ashutosh, you have managed to rise above
the dirt. I will always respect you for that.

00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:46.559
Mr. Ashutosh, you have managed to rise above
the dirt. I will always respect you for that.

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:47.416
But believe me, Mr. Byomkesh

00:42:47.417 --> 00:42:48.875
But believe me, Mr. Byomkesh

00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:52.375
The gramophone pin wasn't shot by them...

00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:55.666
Haha! You're right! They didn't.
But they hired someone to do it for them.

00:42:57.208 --> 00:43:02.041
Who? - I hope to catch
that person in a few days.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.958
Come in.

00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:26.583
May I enter?

00:43:32.083 --> 00:43:33.750
Nomoshkaar (Hello)

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.916
Nomoshkaar (Hello)

00:43:40.166 --> 00:43:41.166
Nomoshkaar (Hello)

00:43:43.083 --> 00:43:46.083
Hello, I am Prafulla Ray.

00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:50.250
I am an insurance agent.

00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:55.124
Forgive me, but we don't have any
money for insurance policies.

00:43:55.125 --> 00:44:00.291
Hahaha! I haven't come to
pitch you insurance schemes.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.958
I have come to seek some private advice.

00:44:01.959 --> 00:44:06.915
I have come to seek some private advice.

00:44:06.916 --> 00:44:09.958
You ought to give me some sort of
token for the advice, don't you think?

00:44:11.833 --> 00:44:14.333
But of course...

00:44:16.958 --> 00:44:17.958
Should I leave it here?

00:44:22.625 --> 00:44:26.291
I know you are very busy,
so I will keep it brief.

00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:28.125
I work at Jewel Insurance Company...

00:44:28.126 --> 00:44:30.082
I work at Jewel Insurance Company...

00:44:30.083 --> 00:44:32.916
Business was booming...

00:44:33.125 --> 00:44:36.791
But then a young fellow suddenly started to
create problems that were bad for business

00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:44.291
He began siphoning all the major
clients over to his side.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.291
I couldn't find a way to
teach him a lesson...

00:44:47.708 --> 00:44:55.708
But then my eyes fell on this
advertisement... You may have missed it...

00:44:57.208 --> 00:45:00.666
I was ecstatic upon seeing it...

00:45:02.208 --> 00:45:05.958
I thought maybe this could help me deal
with the thorn on my road...

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:09.750
I followed the instructions and
reached the specified spot...

00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:31.875
Very mysterious, all of it...

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:37.916
It says I have to go meet them,
is it wise to go there alone?

00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:44.666
Look, Mr. Prafulla, I am
a little busy today...

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:50.249
Your meeting is tomorrow night. Do one
thing, leave these papers with me.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:54.708
I will think over it tonight and let you
know what you ought to do by then.

00:45:55.541 --> 00:45:57.832
N-no.. I mean...

00:45:57.833 --> 00:46:03.415
I have some work tomorrow morning,
is it possible for you to go to tonight?

00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:07.541
Tonight, I have to be somewhere
else, Mr. Prafulla...

00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:11.625
If you can't make it tomorrow morning,
come in the evening -Very well then.

00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:14.333
As you wish.

00:46:17.125 --> 00:46:18.125
Do you want a paan?

00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:21.208
For you?

00:46:23.125 --> 00:46:24.583
You don't want it?

00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:29.375
I can't really do without it!

00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:38.958
Mr. Byomkesh, should I inform the police?

00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:43.750
If you wish to go to the police, you may. Take
the money from the table while you're at it.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.166
No no, since you disapprove of it, I won't.

00:46:48.916 --> 00:46:50.196
All right, I will take my leave.

00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:26.582
Get up, get ready!
- What is the meaning of all this?

00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:28.332
Tonight's the invitation
for the "thorn" obviously!

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:31.624
I can't go anywhere after such a heavy meal.
You can go oblige the invitee by yourself!

00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:32.999
No you will come along with me-

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.665
We have to offer some advice to
Prafulla tomorrow morning, remember?

00:47:34.666 --> 00:47:36.826
Ah, all right, all right!
- Hurry up, don't dilly dally!

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.666
Let me see, Ajit. Look at me.

00:47:53.833 --> 00:47:55.749
Woah, what is this?

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.416
Armour, I will be wearing one too.

00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:00.915
Hold still, I will be right back.
- No-o, do we really need to wear this?

00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:04.516
Yes, we do. -I am uncomfortable with how your
defense strategy involves a sex change!

00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:22.958
Sound is disguised by other sounds.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.583
Isn't it so?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Ajit, you recognize him, don't you?

00:50:32.958 --> 00:50:34.875
Our friendly visitor from the morning.

00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:37.875
The Meghnad to our gramophone pin mystery!

00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:43.041
Mr. Ajit, my cycle has caused you no harm.

00:50:45.458 --> 00:50:47.208
I am very fond of this bicycle...

00:50:48.833 --> 00:50:51.125
Will you make sure it is somewhere safe?

00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:56.708
Where do you think you are going, Ajit?

00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.850
Do you know what sort
of bicycle that is?

00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:04.000
That bell houses all the gramophone pins.

00:51:04.083 --> 00:51:06.763
Be patient, why can't you wait
quietly? The police are on their way.

00:51:07.708 --> 00:51:11.958
You are very clever, Mr. Byomkesh! - Thank
you but you are no less, Mr. Prafulla.

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.416
Not everybody can make such
an ingenious fatal machine.

00:51:15.958 --> 00:51:17.875
I am from Midnapore.

00:51:18.083 --> 00:51:19.833
My father owned a cycle shop...

00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:21.958
That's where I learned how to repair them...

00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:30.375
I lost him, my brothers, everything...
to the flood.

00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:33.458
I came look for work in the city...

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.625
But work...

00:51:39.083 --> 00:51:40.708
To avoid dying of starvation....

00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:44.125
this strange business idea struck me...

00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:47.541
I have removed the thorns
for a great many people...

00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:51.536
What else could I have done?

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.833
We all need to sustain our own selves.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.333
Don't you agree?

00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:04.250
Could I get some..some water?

00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:07.625
My throat feels parched...

00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:10.000
You will get some at the station.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.041
Then, can you give a
paan from my container?

00:52:17.458 --> 00:52:18.958
Just to soothe my throat a bit.

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.750
Thank you.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.958
You can take one each as well.

00:52:38.875 --> 00:52:39.875
Keep it back!

00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:49.208
So you won't let me go then?

00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:52.666
You'll hand me over to the police?

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:57.750
Mr. Byomkesh-

00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:01.791
Even clever men make mistakes...

00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:05.708
You can never hand me over to the police-
- Ajit! Ajit! AJIT!

00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:10.957
Ajit! Hold him still! Mr. Prafulla?!

00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:14.916
Had you eaten the paan too,
we could have gone away together...

00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:22.166
What is going on? Is he dead?

00:53:37.375 --> 00:53:39.041
The culprit has escaped justice, Officer.

00:54:08.666 --> 00:54:09.750
Byomkesh-

00:54:10.833 --> 00:54:15.458
How did you know that the man behind the thorns ad
and the gramophone pin killer was one and the same?

00:54:19.708 --> 00:54:21.333
What is the thorns ad really saying?

00:54:22.375 --> 00:54:26.541
If you have to obliterate those who
stand in the way of your happiness...

00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:29.125
they can avail of his services.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.916
On the other hand, all the victims
of the gramophone pin killer...

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.666
they were all thorns on
somebody's road to happiness.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.375
And they were all heirless.

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:44.000
All their wealth would go to
some nephew, or sons-in-law...

00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:49.875
The greed for inheritance is pretty evident
from Mr. Ashutosh's case itself.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.780
This is just one side of things.

00:54:52.625 --> 00:54:56.166
The other thing deals with
these ads in the newspapers...

00:54:57.083 --> 00:55:01.625
where living thorns are eliminated
with a weapon that looks like a thorn.

00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:03.208
A guess again?

00:55:04.333 --> 00:55:05.416
This was an easy guess.

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.333
Let's go...

00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:14.875
We can deposit Mr. Ashutosh
cheque reward in the bank.

00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:21.208
And return the cycle bell, in exchange
for your bounty from the police. Let's go.

00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:23.923
Do you know what I was
thinking instead, Ajit?

00:55:25.083 --> 00:55:29.291
If they let me keep the bell instead
of the two thousand rupees...

00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:34.666
I mean it's strange and marvelous
piece of craftsmanship...

00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.083
Yet, what a waste...

00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:40.083
Byomkesh-

00:55:40.791 --> 00:55:43.552
You have been reading news of
all that's going on around the world...

00:55:43.916 --> 00:55:48.958
If a simpleton from the village can
create something this impactful...

00:55:50.125 --> 00:55:55.540
if the superpowers of the world combine their
resources and brains to fight each other

00:55:55.541 --> 00:55:57.958
can you imagine where the
world is headed towards?

00:56:00.958 --> 00:56:01.958
Yes, I can imagine...

00:56:03.083 --> 00:56:07.208
Perhaps an invention which can annihilate
an entire city within moments...

00:56:08.875 --> 00:56:10.875
Will you applaud its craftsmanship as well?

00:56:11.875 --> 00:56:14.666
No, I would say that it's destructive.

00:56:15.208 --> 00:56:17.250
But one thing, Ajit....

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:21.416
I hate the criminal mentality
of a skilled man...

00:56:22.333 --> 00:56:24.083
but I still respect his mind.

00:56:26.166 --> 00:56:31.166
Let's go return the bell and get
the money as decided... Come.
