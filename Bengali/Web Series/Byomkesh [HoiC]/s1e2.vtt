00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:10.875
Every 7 years the cells in the human
body undergo a transformation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.833
The older cells disintegrate
and do not retain their identity.

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:18.332
But those among them responsible for
the functions of the human body...

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.708
i.e. those which are intangible
but exist in the greater universe...

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
constitute the life force
of the human body.

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:28.000
Sometimes cancerous cells
may be found in the human body.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.535
But those cells are anomalous
and independent entities.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.416
These cells have a negative
effect on the life force.

00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.166
And are repugnant to the body.

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.375
For the body, this could be...

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:42.916
What's wrong brother?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.708
It's the same thing all over again.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.666
Could you please handle it Satya?

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:48.333
Let me see...

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:52.041
Hari? Jagannath?

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.541
Hari?

00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:55.375
Uncle...
- Yes?

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:58.750
Hari's daughter is very sick.
So I gave him the day off.

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:00.916
Oh.

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:02.916
Ok.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.416
Could you please
get me a cup of tea?

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.583
Right away!
- Thank you.

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.874
Fani, you tell me...

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.833
do we ever disrespect Uncle?

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:20.291
He can be really rude sometimes.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:23.500
Why do you take,
what he says, to heart, Sukumar?

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.500
You know how he is.

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:29.708
Don't sit here and sulk.
Go out and get some air.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.431
There's a good film runnning at Chitra.
It's called 'Kapalkundala'.

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:34.726
I've wanted to watch
it for quite a while.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.541
Yes, Makhan was telling me about it.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:38.541
It has Uma Sashi and Durga Bannerjee.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:39.250
Right?

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:42.041
I'm thinking about
catching the night show.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:43.958
Please do go.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.208
Oh yes... I have read your book.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Please do take it back.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:49.875
Ok.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:29.458
BYOMKESH_EP_02_SH_04

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.416
Uncle?

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.083
Mr. Byomkesh?
- Yes?

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:53.541
I always thought that your biographer Ajit
Bandhyopadhyay must be my old friend Ajit.

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:56.500
But I couldn't get myself to believe it.

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.083
Why don't you go?
- What?

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:01.875
What can they possibly do?

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:04.875
How can you underestimate the
deputy commissioner Bidhu Bhattacharya?

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:09.500
He has given strict orders not to allow me to talk to
anyone in the house until he has made a full investigation.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:12.101
What did he say when
you called right now?

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.958
He has just left the police station. So we
can't do anything for at least 2 hours.

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:18.833
2 hours?
- Is this a new case?

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:19.750
Yes, sir.

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:21.791
A man has been murdered.

00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.750
The commissioner himself has told
Byomkesh to investigate the matter.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.458
But the deputy commissioner
doesn't like him much.

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.916
That is the matter of concern.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.250
Please do have something
to eat before you leave.

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:33.750
Yes, of course.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.836
There was something I had to say-
- Yes, tell me.

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.500
That is why I had asked
Ajit to invite you here.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:42.458
I had a problem to discuss
but you seem to be very-

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.291
No, no. Please go ahead.
I still have a couple of hours to spare.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.583
It may be a very frivolous matter...

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.708
but to me it is a puzzle
which is impossible to solve.

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:53.625
Puzzle?

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.250
Ok, tell me about it.

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:59.708
I am a personal physician for
a very wealthy household.

00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:02.291
The head of the family
is Nanda Dulal Basu.

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:04.208
And he is my only patient.
- Ok.

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:07.375
He was so irresponsible
in his youth that...

00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:10.125
once he grew a little older,
his body completely broke down.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:13.208
He was afflicted by arthritis,
and partially paralysed.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:14.708
And many more diseases

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.958
You know there's a saying in
medical science

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.166
that there's no wonder in death

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.333
Living is a wonder

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.790
Whenever I see the man

00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.374
it reminds me of this fact

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:30.957
Baba (Father) Get lost

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.540
What do they understand...

00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:36.125
These shithead editors?

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:38.583
Huh!
These people will honor my writings..

00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:41.000
As if..

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.166
Baba..Please control yourself

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.434
Keep your mouth shut you miscreant

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:45.458
Get out from here

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.041
Baba..you are angry with the editors

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.375
Why are you venting it out on food?

00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:56.416
(Laughs mockingly) The wife of a
miscreant is no lesser than him

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.083
Just disappear from my eyesight
Go away

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:06.291
Mohon

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.916
Is he an author?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Hmm..He thinks he is an unparalleled author

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:12.791
I see

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:15.916
Once I have read his scribbles

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.541
They are disgustingly filthy

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:22.125
After reading them, Even if you bathe
in the Ganges it wont pure your soul

00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:25.708
Throughout the day he is scribbling
Once with red ink once with black

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:29.166
I get it
But what is the issue here..

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.125
Ever seen someone getting
intoxicated by tarantula juice?

00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:35.958
What??
Tarantula juice?

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:37.083
Hmm

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:39.666
What is this Byomkesh?

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.083
Tarantula dance

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:47.791
Previously existed in Spain & caused an incontrollable
impulse to dance after bitten by a Tarantula

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.207
Terrific poison

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:54.541
The addiction is widespread amongst one of
South America's Spanish indigeneous tribe

00:07:54.583 --> 00:08:01.625
Intaking a minimal amount of the poison causes
a certain excitement in your nervous system

00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:06.165
But it's regular consumption
can lead to death by paralysis

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:09.375
This Nandadulal Babu is an addict.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:15.333
The day I was assigned as their home
physician I stopped this practice

00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:22.958
Listen Nandadulal Babu, you have to get
rid of this addiction if you want to live

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:27.332
Nonsense! A quack doctor like you
can't prevent me from doing it

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.540
I have seen many like you

00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.291
I won't allow that poison
in this house anymore

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:37.290
Oh really? I'll take it again.
Let me see how you stop me

00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:41.749
You know Mr. Byomkesh I have kept
his house under strict surveillance

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.582
To keep a check on him

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:48.165
Despite everything he is
still hooked to the drug

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:53.582
No one could figure from where he is
importing this Tarantula Toxin

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:59.750
The strange thing is one entire day
I was with him to keep an eye on him

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:04.249
He skipped my attention
thrice and took the poison

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.666
And I couldn't figure how!

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.582
Now my question is how is he procuring
the toxin And deceptively consuming it

00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:17.000
And even if he's procuring it,
how is he intaking it

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:18.886
Mohanbabu, can I make a call?
Yes of course!

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:26.208
(Murmuring)

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:30.624
Hello, Byomkesh Bakshi speaking

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:32.250
Has Bidhubabu arrived?

00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:33.958
Thank you, I am coming right now!

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:35.666
Ajit, pass me the cigarette packet

00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:38.540
Byomkesh babu, I mean..
Yes, say

00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:40.165
You're a busy man

00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:46.083
Nothing like that, I have listened
to what you said I'm curious as well

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:48.583
But what to do I'm tied up for a while now

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.583
Actually if we get a solution
we might save his life

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:54.208
Hmm..you are right we could save his life

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.665
Alright, let's do something

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.749
Let Ajit accompany you

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.374
He'll look into the matter

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.500
I'll hear it from him and find a solution

00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:03.499
Ajit?
Why are you worried?

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.791
This companionship has
made your childhood friend rather astute

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.625
very well, If you say so

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:11.208
Fine, then Ajit will only go

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:14.250
Listen Ajit, observe everything
carefully and inform me

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:17.166
Now let me rush and see what Bidhubabu
is cooking. Goodbye Mohanbabu!

00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:18.458
Yes. Goodbye!

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:26.291
Ajit, find out about the letters
Nandadulal Babu receive.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.333
Stand up properly.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:34.101
You're playing smart with
Deputy Commissioner Bidhu Bhattacharya?

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:35.708
Tell me!

00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:38.250
One whack and you'll say everything!

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.333
Tell me everything

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:45.458
One whack and you'll say everything!

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:46.708
Speak straight.

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:50.166
Budhhu Babu, I don't know anything!
Stop lying

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.875
I know what you are aware of..
I understand everything

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:54.500
You know everything. Now confess

00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.916
Oh you are here..
Take a seat

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:01.125
It's a trivial matter

00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:06.416
There was a murder last night I've
identified the suspect and issued a warrant

00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:09.875
Even then if you have to ask anything...

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.832
What are you saying

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:15.416
When you, yourself is investigating the
case. What is left there for me to say...

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:20.832
I only wanted to understand the crux of the
matter.. and if you consider me as your assistant

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:21.999
Hmm

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.833
The patriarch of this house Karali Babu
was murdered last night

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:29.000
The execution is of an eccentric kind

00:11:29.208 --> 00:11:31.791
Hence Saheb (Sir) is feeling dejected

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.385
But actually the case
is crystal clear to me

00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:36.666
Crystal clear

00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:42.165
So his nephew..What's his name?

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:42.875
Motilal

00:11:42.876 --> 00:11:47.833
Motilal
He killed his uncle and absconded.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.458
If you kindly elucidate the case

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:53.458
Actually the size of my brain
is as much as your physique

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:58.625
Oh, haha! You're calling
yourself a thickheaded one!

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:00.540
Wait. Clarifying!

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:04.250
Hey you, recount properly when
did Motilal leave the house?

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.041
I didn't check the time.
Must be around 1 or 2

00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.416
You've seen him around 1?
- Yes.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:11.708
You've seen him around 2?
- Yes, Yes

00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:14.833
Recall properly what time did you see him?

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:18.625
Seen him around 12!

00:12:18.626 --> 00:12:20.000
Where were you at that time?

00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:22.583
When did you come here?

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.791
Half an hour after Motibabu
left I closed the door and came here.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.833
Sukumar Babu came just before that.

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.291
Came before that?

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.175
That means Sukumar Babu
returned before that.

00:12:37.583 --> 00:12:38.583
Oh!

00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:42.708
Fine. Now you go and come
if you're summoned. Go!

00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:45.708
Just go. Get away from here.

00:12:48.458 --> 00:12:52.000
If not fed properly I can't
interrogate with ease

00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:55.166
Interrogation, in reality is an art

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:56.583
Have a seat.
What?

00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:58.375
Sit.
Sit where?

00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:00.500
Here, take a seat.

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:07.915
Now if you explain the matter.
What is left there to explain?

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:09.249
I have deciphered everything!

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.583
Deciphered everything?
Of course!

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.750
Still if you kindly explain it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.333
Okay then...

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:19.041
Actually the owner of
this house Karali Babu

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.875
He was a wealthy and affluent man..

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.333
He possesses three to four
lacs rupees in his account

00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:30.000
Though he was a childless widower,
he fostered a few children

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:35.541
Like his three nephews...
Motilal, Makhonlal and Fani... Fanibhushan

00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:40.708
Also, his sister-in-law's two
children Satyabati and Sukumar

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:45.457
So this Karali Babu had a dreadful temper

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.291
I mean a strangely weird and demented man

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:53.916
So all his tangible and intangible
assests... Hello, are you listening?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.708
Oh yes!
Continue..

00:13:54.875 --> 00:14:00.291
I was saying, he often kept changing the will
of all his tangible and intangible assests.

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:05.583
Suppose today someone is in his good books
he may chance to be his heir

00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:11.583
And if ever he develop an aversion for him
he admonishes his name from the will

00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:15.082
Now what happened..
Hello, so I was saying..

00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:16.874
You were listening, right?
- Yes carry on

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:20.583
The last three wills
which were found from his cupboard

00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:22.958
The first one for Makhonlal

00:14:23.416 --> 00:14:26.082
The next on for..what Lal?
- Motilal

00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:27.375
Yes, yes Motilal

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.708
The third one is for Sukumar

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.958
Therefore Sukumar is the last heir

00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.500
This is Motilal's room

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:46.333
For the convenience of his night time
youthful exploits, he stays downstairs

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:49.178
Karali Babu's one of those nonindulgent men

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.750
No one was allowed to stay
outside home after 9pm

00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:56.416
Karali Babu used to stay upstairs,
above this room. Come.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.041
Everyday that girl Satyabati
used to get tea and wake him up.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.583
This morning when Karali Babu didn't
respond she found out he is dead.

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:13.833
And after that..come inside.

00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:16.458
It's a very interesting matter

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:18.875
Where medulla and the first
vertebrae colligate...

00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:21.708
Motilal pierced a needle and murdered him

00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:42.000
Very strange indeed.
- Haha!

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.375
Nobody could figure until I found it out

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:48.250
Yes, definitely.

00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:52.031
Did you get any information
about Motilal's whereabouts?

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.666
Just nothing!

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.916
Barely studied after third
standard..an absolute lumpen

00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:01.083
He is an expert at wasting his
uncle's money and jiving around.

00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.916
When did Motilal meet Karali
Babu for the last time?

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:05.958
Yesterday morning.

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.186
The will was probated for Motilal only

00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:11.583
Karali Babu changed it to Sukumar's name.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.625
This lead to a feud between the uncle
and nephew and a motive for the murder

00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:17.916
Motilal leaves the house
after murdering him.

00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:22.333
The cook is a witness to this.
It's water-clear.

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:26.458
The cup is half filled but
the saucer is full. Why?

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:29.000
I told you just now.
- I heard it, but why?

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:32.708
This is a problem with
avocational detectives like you.

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.541
You don't have much to do
at the moment isn't it?

00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:43.333
I think you've noticed there are three
needle marks in Karali Babu's neck.

00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:49.833
Didn't I tell you it's difficult to find the
exact junction of medulla and vertebrae

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:54.041
For that, you have to pierce the needle
quite a few times to hit the spot.

00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:59.957
I beg your pardon. Can you
show me the needle once?

00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.291
If that's not an issue

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.250
Oh, yes sure!

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.500
Thank you!

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.375
Strange!
- Why? What is strange?

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.750
The needle is threaded with a yarn.

00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:31.500
Why do find it so strange, isn't is
how it is supposed to be? Strange!!

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:33.958
Of course, that's how it is

00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:38.416
A needle is created for the yarn.

00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:41.916
Bidhubabu, how did Makhonlal seem to you?

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:45.541
Makhonlal is a little lesser
in comparison to Motilal

00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:52.708
He indulges in occasional intoxication
but isn't as meritless as his brother

00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:53.583
What about Sukumar?

00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:58.708
Sukumar? Sukumar is a very impressive chap,
a medical student in his 5th year.

00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.750
Sukumar returned late last night, isn't it?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.750
Here's the proof of my Bioscope visit.

00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:34.416
Give it to me.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.291
Karali babu didn't approve of
staying out till late at night.

00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:42.958
Despite that what is the reason
that you went for a night show?

00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:46.291
Reason..umm So you are the heir
to Karali Babu's entire property?

00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:50.666
Yes.
- That's a great deal of money, isnt it?

00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:55.333
When was the last time you met Karali Babu?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.208
Uncle, spare me from this burden of shame.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.708
That means you don't want my inheritance?

00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:05.500
It would be inaccurate if I say no

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:06.707
But I don't want it all by myself

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:11.000
Why don't you equally distribute
your property amongst all of us.

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:15.500
I see, so this boy is trying to
be the flagbearer of equality..

00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:18.750
How dare you contradict me?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.416
Uncle, I didn't mean to
disrespect your decision...

00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:25.290
But how can I deprive
everyone else from it...

00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:27.291
Out! Get out from here!!

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.750
I am not going to give you a single penny!

00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:34.041
You rascal..belial..get
lost from here, get out!

00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:50.708
Are you suspecting Sukumar
to be the muderer?

00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:54.958
Sukumar? How's it possible?
You said Motilal is the murderer.

00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:57.000
Yes.
- So?

00:19:57.458 --> 00:20:00.208
This is Satyabati's room, right?
- Yes

00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:06.041
But why trouble a woman? I have
already taken her deposition.

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:09.125
Oh, you've taken an account. Alright then.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.500
Still let's visit once.

00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:25.000
Listen, we want to...

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.833
Don't mind us bothering you for a while.

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:36.250
After this accident this police interrogation
must feel like rubbing salt on your wounds.

00:20:36.583 --> 00:20:41.291
Listen, unnecessarily don't defame
the Police, you're not one of us!

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.500
I'm only going to ask a couple of questions

00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.750
For Karali Babu, every morning you
used to... Pardon me, may I sit?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.875
Hmm
- Thank you!

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:05.875
You used to make tea and wake
Karali Babu up everyday, isnt it?

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:10.916
Today was no different...
only that you found him dead

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:18.666
You didn't know anything before that?
- What silly questions!

00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:22.041
Karali Babu's room's door
remained open all the time?

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.583
No one was allowed to lock
their doors while sleeping.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.250
Uncle used to do the same.

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:33.791
Then...

00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:37.083
Enough is enough, you don't
even know how to cross check!

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.559
Listen Bidhu Babu, if you constantly interrupt me I'll
file a legal complaint against you to the commisioner.

00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:44.333
You don't want it, do you?

00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:53.041
You really didn't know anything
about it before, give it a thought!

00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:58.833
Given it a thought. I didn't know anything!

00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:02.291
Okay, how many spoons of sugar
Karali babu used to take?

00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:06.458
Sugar?
- Sugar.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:11.875
Uncle used to take quite an extra amount of sugar
with tea... around three to four tablespoons.

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:14.583
My goodness, three to four tablespoons!

00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:16.841
So why didn't you add
sugar in his tea today?

00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:29.708
Actually... Actually... I am not feeling
well today... Maybe that is why...

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:35.500
Where is the needle?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.874
Needle?

00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:42.041
Yes, needle. You use it for sewing right?

00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:45.208
And I can't find the thimble as well.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.750
It would have been beneficial for you all
if you could open up.

00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:00.291
I'll take a leave.

00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:28.583
You know what Bidhubabu, I'm yet to learn
the art of patience from you.

00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.457
Whatever it is, a senior like me..
- How's this Fanibhushan chap?

00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:33.041
Who?
- Fanibhushan.

00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:35.000
Fanibhushan is a cripple.

00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:38.666
And although the saying goes that 'a
crippled body hosts a crippled mind'...

00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:41.957
but if compared to the other
3 brothers he seems more humane.

00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:42.958
Humane?

00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:44.125
Let's find out.

00:23:44.126 --> 00:23:46.291
Where?
- To Fanibhushan's room.

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:55.916
Nomoshkar (Greetings) sit, sit.
- Yes

00:23:57.666 --> 00:24:03.500
Byomkesh babu, my brother might be
short-tempered but he is not a murderer.

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:06.500
I don't believe he has done this.

00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:12.875
You don't think even losing out on the inheritance
could make him do this out of aversion?

00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:19.415
In that case all three of us have that
excuse. Why only doubt Dada (elder brother)?

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:21.375
Right, absolutely right.

00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:23.666
How's your equation with Karali Babu?

00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:32.583
I am a cripple, useless. Probably
that is why he sympathized with me.

00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:38.207
If Uncle didn't give me shelter,
maybe I would have starved to death.

00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:42.128
I guess you're aware that according to Karali Babu's
last will Sukumar is the heir to his property.

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:47.583
Of course, Sukumar is the most
suitable one. - Most suitable one.

00:24:48.666 --> 00:24:51.791
In that case, have you decided
what you are going to do?

00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:55.416
If Sukumar permits, then I'll stay here.

00:24:55.625 --> 00:24:57.083
Or else...

00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:59.541
Fani, dada has been arrested.

00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:03.000
So you are Makhon?
- And you?

00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:05.457
Don't worry, I am not a policeman,
just a mere truthseeker (Satyanweshi).

00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:08.790
Satyanweshi Byomkesh Bakshi?
I don't know anything.

00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:10.957
Believe me I don't know anything.

00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.583
Believe me, sir I don't know anything.

00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:17.916
For god's sake, I don't know anything
Please let me go!

00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:21.791
Bastard. You're trying to fool Bidhu
Bhattacharya? Confess everything! Confess!

00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:26.958
Believe me, believe me Buddhu Babu.
- It's not Buddhu Babu, it's Bidhu Babu.

00:25:27.708 --> 00:25:32.000
Yes, yes. I am an alcoholic imbecile.
It's only wine and women that concerns me.

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:38.333
I was with Dalim last night, she's
a witness. I don't know anything!

00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:43.541
From where is he arrested?
- A concubine's home, near Jorasanko.

00:25:44.041 --> 00:25:50.666
The entire city is under the surveillance of Bidhu
Bhattacharya. Not a single fly can escape it.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.583
Well, it's late you may go home now!

00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:57.500
Shall get him confessed after
a good thrash! Hey, get him.

00:25:57.833 --> 00:25:58.833
Come!

00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.458
Please leave me, I know nothing.

00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:34.250
What are you writing, Ajit?

00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:38.125
Anandabazar is publishing a
literary magazine called Desh

00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:41.125
And calling for new writers,
penning a piece for it.

00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:43.957
But what I have read in the morning

00:26:43.958 --> 00:26:46.125
It's difficult to render
something worthy after that.

00:26:46.541 --> 00:26:49.790
Had the French naturalist
Émile Zola read that

00:26:49.791 --> 00:26:51.231
He would have been equally disgusted

00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:53.707
What exactly did you read?

00:26:53.708 --> 00:26:56.166
Don't you remember whom did
I visit in the morning?

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.166
Umm..morning..
Oh, that tarantula toxin.

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:03.291
I almost forgot.

00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:07.000
Alright, so tell me what
did you see in that house?

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:11.875
Listen then, I reached that house...

00:27:29.458 --> 00:27:31.625
Whom have you brought, doctor?

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.083
Tell him to leave.

00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:45.290
Again you've taken it today?

00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:47.875
It's my choice. It's nobody's business!

00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:51.250
God knows from where
he's getting the poison

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.916
Neither could we figure when he's taking it

00:27:57.416 --> 00:28:01.040
Listen, this poison is
affecting your health

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:03.207
It's damaging your brain.

00:28:03.208 --> 00:28:06.750
But your brain works absolutely fine,

00:28:07.208 --> 00:28:09.875
Why can't you find out?

00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:12.833
Also kept my house under surveillance.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.666
Even they are unable to find it out.

00:28:15.958 --> 00:28:21.457
Nincompoops! Can't find out... Hahaha!

00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:22.499
Nomoshkar, Nandadulal Babu!

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.666
Shut up! There is no need for all these.

00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:34.082
Beside you both there is no one
who goes into his room, isn't it?

00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:35.083
No

00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:38.583
Does he receive any letters?

00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:42.125
Yes, once a week there is a
registry mail, from Kolkata.

00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:45.166
A lady named Rebecca Lite sends them.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.791
Only blank papers and nothing else.

00:28:56.875 --> 00:29:00.750
Does your father, Nandadulal
Babu, write to anyone?

00:29:01.125 --> 00:29:02.125
No.

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:10.041
But he sends a money order of 100 rupees
to Rebecca Lite every month.

00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:17.541
How does the thing enter his house...

00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:22.541
And how does Nandadulal babu take it...

00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:28.000
What is the purpose of the
blank registered paper?

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.083
And what is the reason
behind sending her money?

00:29:33.416 --> 00:29:35.583
Give it a thought, Ajit.

00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:41.250
I have thought about all these, a lot of
times. Nothing is getting in my head.

00:29:42.208 --> 00:29:46.041
Let's hear about your current case!

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:49.166
Do you think Motilal is the culprit?

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:55.333
Then who?

00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:58.875
Who?

00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:13.500
Keeping Motilal aside, there remains
Fani, Makhon, Sukumar and Satyabati...

00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:16.083
Everyone has equal motives.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.875
Satyabati too?
- Why not?

00:30:18.916 --> 00:30:20.250
But what can be her motive?

00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:23.059
According to Karali's last will her brother
is the sole proprietor of his assets.

00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:25.374
The one who changes his
will so frequently...

00:30:25.375 --> 00:30:28.375
If he's murdered there won't be
any such further possibilities

00:30:30.583 --> 00:30:35.833
Hence, Satyabati too can't be
waived off the suspect list, Ajit.

00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.708
So Byomkesh

00:30:41.833 --> 00:30:46.458
You're suggesting that it
is chloroform marks in Karali Babu's nose?

00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:52.166
Can't disclose this to Buddhu Babu

00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:55.916
He thinks it is phlegm mark.

00:30:58.208 --> 00:31:00.875
The murder took place at 12am...

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.291
How can you say it so convincingly?

00:31:06.083 --> 00:31:08.375
Conjecture...

00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:11.083
But what I can't decipher is...

00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:18.666
Why did the murderer
kept the needle pierced?

00:31:19.208 --> 00:31:22.833
Had he taken it out there
would have been no evidence!

00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:29.250
Few significant portions is marked in red
from Grey's Anatomy in Sukumar's room

00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.583
But where is that pencil?

00:31:35.166 --> 00:31:37.458
What was written in those
marked portions from the book?

00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:44.040
If a needle is pierced right at the
junction of Medulla and First Vertebrae...

00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:45.958
it'll cause instant death.

00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:58.416
The cook and the servant are
the sole witness to the will

00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:02.291
Yes, these two. Give.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.166
Bidhubabu, we could have looked
for the rest of the rooms..

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.208
What's the need? I have done
it all and found the culprit

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:16.333
Why get involved in all
these unnecessarily?

00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:18.583
Makes sense!
- Hmm

00:32:21.708 --> 00:32:24.666
I'll leave then.
- Where?

00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:27.041
I'll go home only...

00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:30.916
but before that if I could drop by the
commissioner's office once...

00:32:31.208 --> 00:32:32.750
Needed to report to him.

00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:33.957
So Byomkesh Babu
- Yes, tell me?

00:32:33.958 --> 00:32:36.708
I was saying which rooms
needed to be searched?

00:32:39.125 --> 00:32:40.125
Come, I'll tell you.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:00.916
With reference to, today,
22nd September 1933

00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:05.458
I declare this will being
in sound senses...

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.374
after my demise all my tangible
and intangible assests...

00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:11.083
and other relevant properties...

00:33:11.166 --> 00:33:15.125
will be inherited by my youngest
niece Shri Fanibhushan...

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.791
Hence, from today, all my
previous will becomes invalid.

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:24.083
Undersigned, Shri Karalicharan Basu.

00:33:25.375 --> 00:33:30.333
Oh boy! You wanted to obliterate
this will, didn't you?

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:33.666
Sir, this bottle of chloroform
has been found as well.

00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:35.791
What?
- Yes, sir

00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:38.832
The marks which were there
in Karali Babu's nose...

00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:40.624
those were chloroform marks.

00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:44.333
Byomkesh Babu was saying this.
- Shut up!

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:47.541
Byomkesh babu were saying?
He's a young chap. What does he know?

00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:50.125
I said it, what?
- Yes, yes.

00:33:51.125 --> 00:33:52.375
Here take it!

00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:58.625
What does that metal cap called
which protects the finger while sewing?

00:33:58.791 --> 00:34:00.458
Thimble?

00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:03.375
Thimble, thimble. Has it been found?

00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:05.875
No sir, that has is not found.

00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:07.333
Not found?
- No sir.

00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:10.708
Who knows how much till
will it take to find it.

00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:13.875
Anyway, go and put him behind the bars.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.416
Sir.

00:34:15.791 --> 00:34:17.291
Bring him.

00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:20.458
You've set Motilal free finally?

00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:24.250
Bidhubabu has gotten into senses.

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:28.166
Apart from Sukumar's had anyone else's
room been searched?

00:34:30.708 --> 00:34:32.375
No. Why?

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.375
To Bidhubabu nothing seems necessary.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:43.625
Inspite of having overwhelming evidences
against Sukumar, the investigation must go on.

00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:48.708
Until that red pencil and
the thimble are found...

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.583
It isn't advisable to
cease the investigation

00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:53.708
Have you got the medical reports?

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.333
What is the time of death?

00:35:00.166 --> 00:35:03.875
3 hours after dinner which
means around 12, isnt it?

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:09.166
Alright, thank you. I'll be there tomorrow.

00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:17.458
Byomkesh, that means
Sukumar is the murderer.

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:20.833
See, Ajit...

00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:25.290
It seems like someone is
trying to make it obvious...

00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:29.000
That Karali Babu has
been murdered by a doctor..

00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:33.250
This kind of murder is impossible
without the knowledge of anatomy.

00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:38.540
The needle which was used was stolen from
his sister's sewing box

00:35:38.541 --> 00:35:40.416
In fact the thread is exactly the same.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.166
And Sukumar confessed that..

00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:46.916
That he had a tiff with
Karali babu that night.

00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:52.916
For him it was apparent that Karali Babu
would have changed his will again

00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:57.416
The motive behind the murder is clear.

00:35:57.958 --> 00:35:59.583
Then where is the doubt?

00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:03.541
Everything is being laid out in front
of our eyes very clearly, Ajit...

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.375
That is where the doubt remains.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.041
Byomkesh babu, please save my brother...

00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:27.500
My brother is innocent...

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.708
He doesn't know anything...

00:36:31.208 --> 00:36:32.541
without offence...

00:36:32.583 --> 00:36:34.458
But all evidences are against him...

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.541
All lies...

00:36:37.583 --> 00:36:40.750
He can't murder anyone for property...

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.958
We don't need any property,
Byomkesh Babu...

00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:47.208
Please save my brother from this trouble...

00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:51.291
My brother didn't commit
any crime, trust me!

00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:54.583
I need to know everything
before I trust you.

00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:56.875
But I haven't hidden anything.

00:36:57.125 --> 00:36:58.916
You have, you have
undoubtedly hidden facts.

00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:03.166
That very night you got to know about
Karali babu's death but didn't tell me.

00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:07.953
Are you going to say it now?

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:19.083
When I went to Uncle's room...

00:37:19.166 --> 00:37:20.999
There was a smell...

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.166
not very strong rather a sweet one...

00:37:23.625 --> 00:37:25.250
Can't really define the smell.

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:26.291
Hmm.. chloroform

00:37:48.625 --> 00:37:49.625
After that?

00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:54.250
The next morning some how
I made tea and went to Uncle's room...

00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:10.541
Oh traveler have you lost your way?

00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:15.000
What exactly happened?

00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:19.875
I mean did the sleuth
just become solicitous?

00:38:20.833 --> 00:38:23.333
Insinuating me, Ajit?

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.250
Looking for a path only.

00:38:26.916 --> 00:38:31.666
By the way, in every era it is Kapalkundala
who redirects the lost Nabakumar

00:38:32.583 --> 00:38:34.125
Kapalkundala?

00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:35.458
You know Byomkesh...

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.124
I have found a solution
to the Tarantula case...

00:38:37.125 --> 00:38:39.583
Let your Tarantula poison
be at it's place...

00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:41.291
Cut those crap!

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.916
Let's go and watch
Kapalkundala bioscope tonight.

00:38:46.208 --> 00:38:47.666
What happened to you suddenly?
- Why?

00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:50.958
You've become strangely hysterical

00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:52.184
Let me check if you have fever...

00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:53.665
You're aware that I'm a moonstruck guy...

00:38:53.666 --> 00:38:57.375
When Bhattacharya Babu made my Natal Chart
and said that I'll be lunatic.

00:38:57.833 --> 00:38:59.708
Let's go Ajit, hurry up!

00:38:59.875 --> 00:39:03.583
Hey Putiram, eat your dinner and go
off to sleep... We'll eat outside.

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:08.083
Come fast, lets go... hurry up!!

00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:17.250
Byomkesh, I really enjoyed the bioscope.

00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:20.250
Listen Ajit, what solution did you
find abot the Tarantula case?

00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:25.750
Oh, I think I have found a solution.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.958
Oh really? Tell me then...

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:33.416
Inside Nandadulal babu's room, in corners,
right to left I have noticed spiders...

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.666
When there is no one at
home, in that room...

00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:42.375
he takes those spiders and
suck their juice to get the toxin.

00:39:48.458 --> 00:39:51.666
Ajit, do one thing tomorrow...

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.458
Whatever little dust is
there in your shoes...

00:39:57.666 --> 00:40:00.017
collect and wrap it up in a paper,
Then give it to me without fail.

00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:03.250
But why?
- I'll worship it every morning

00:40:14.583 --> 00:40:18.291
Why are you laughing like a lunatic?

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:30.583
Ajit, is the color of
Nandadulal babu's tongue red?

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.250
Why?

00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:35.333
Find out.

00:40:39.833 --> 00:40:42.333
There lies the actual
solution of this mystery.

00:40:50.916 --> 00:40:55.583
Byomkesh babu, this Sukumar
is the real culprit...

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.415
I knew this from the very beginning

00:40:57.416 --> 00:40:59.416
Really?
- Yes, didn't let anyone understand!

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.375
Was toying with him a bit.
- Impressive!

00:41:04.458 --> 00:41:08.000
What?
- Was looking for your toying equipment!

00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:15.708
Ajit.

00:41:16.916 --> 00:41:18.875
Bidhubabu, look what a strange thing!

00:41:19.875 --> 00:41:21.583
Hush!!

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.541
Bidhubabu, keep him in your custody
for a while. Ajit come with me.

00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:30.125
Wait.

00:41:30.541 --> 00:41:34.083
Bidhubabu, till then keep
this man toying for a while.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.541
Uncle lost his life only for some money!

00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:43.375
As the saying goes, money
is the root of all evil.

00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:49.374
No, Byomkesh Babu this heirship
doesn't make me happy.

00:41:49.375 --> 00:41:51.250
This one is a physiology book.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.208
Must be Sukumar Babu's.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.625
Sometimes Sukumar used to lend
me his physiology books to read.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.375
I used to consider him the
closest in this house.

00:42:05.125 --> 00:42:07.499
But who knows what goes
inside one's mind...

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.375
It's difficult to discern that.

00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:17.416
Fanibabu, you seem to
be a diligent bookworm.

00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:21.541
Yes, that is how I'm sustaining

00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:25.207
So Byomkesh Babu...

00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:30.208
do you really think Sukumar
is the one to be blamed?

00:42:31.375 --> 00:42:37.583
The evidences are redirecting the
clouds of doubt towards him.

00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:40.666
Do I explain it to you?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.958
One thing is clear from this...

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:46.583
The culprit...

00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:50.083
is naive and clever at the same time...

00:42:51.375 --> 00:42:53.335
He executed the murder in
an extremely clever way

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:59.291
But he had kept all the evidences
in his room like a fool.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.708
As if Sukumar had to use Satyabati's
needle for the murder...

00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:08.083
and hide the will in his room...

00:43:08.625 --> 00:43:10.166
He could have just tore it off...

00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:12.833
What do you understand from this?
- What?

00:43:14.666 --> 00:43:15.833
You understand this that...

00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:18.375
the criminal is not a fool
but a very clever one...

00:43:18.416 --> 00:43:19.666
and intelligent...

00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:23.625
But Fanibabu, even a watchful man
can flounder, like in this case...

00:43:25.625 --> 00:43:26.625
What?

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:28.083
Let me explain...

00:43:28.208 --> 00:43:29.250
What mistake?

00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:30.666
But before that...

00:43:32.083 --> 00:43:34.003
give me a pencil I'd like
to make a blueprint...

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.130
Ajit, kindly see if you
get a paper anywhere...

00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:38.540
Yes, give me a pencil.
- Here you go.

00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:39.749
Yes, give it to me.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.875
Got anything?
Let it be, you may sit.

00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:45.489
Okay, a blueprint isn't required
anymore, let me say it...

00:43:46.208 --> 00:43:50.083
In this case the culprit
made three mistakes...

00:43:50.625 --> 00:43:51.625
Firstly...

00:43:52.083 --> 00:43:54.750
In the Grey's Anatomy book...

00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:58.875
he had marked a particular
portion with a red pencil...

00:43:59.916 --> 00:44:03.041
Secondly, he doesn't know about
the jurisdiction in good order...

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.874
Doesn't know about legalities properly?

00:44:05.875 --> 00:44:07.040
No, doesn't know properly at all...

00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:08.624
Hence the crime he
committed went in vain...

00:44:08.625 --> 00:44:10.500
absolutely futile... Fanibabu.

00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:11.791
What?

00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:13.957
Ajit..Ajit..Ajit...

00:44:13.958 --> 00:44:15.208
What do you mean to suggest?

00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:17.582
Take a look at this will...

00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:19.708
This was discovered from
Sukuma Babu's room...

00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:22.790
The will is invalid legally,
it doesn't have a signature of a witness..

00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:24.726
No authorized witness signatory?
What are you saying?

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.207
Wait I'll make it clearer...

00:44:26.208 --> 00:44:28.083
No, no, no wait..
- Let me explain, just listen

00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:29.416
Listen carefully...

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.125
You had instructed Makhon to get the
bottel of chloroform beforehand...

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:37.083
That evening when Sukumar had
a fight with Karali Babu...

00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.166
You had a doubt...

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.041
That Karali Babu might
change his will again...

00:44:42.208 --> 00:44:44.083
And this time it was going be your turn...

00:44:44.583 --> 00:44:46.041
And it was as you expected...

00:44:46.458 --> 00:44:49.874
But you wanted to ensure Karali Babu
doesn't get to change his will...

00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:52.708
So it was necessary to remove him
from being an obstacle..

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.875
But due to your lack of prowess...

00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:59.833
you had to pierce the needle thrice
to hit the exact place.

00:45:00.125 --> 00:45:03.541
A medical student like Sukumar
would have done it at one go.

00:45:05.083 --> 00:45:06.707
If you would have kept the
will at its right place...

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:08.916
you couldn't have framed Sukumar...

00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:12.416
At the same time you must frame
another to save yourself...

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.458
So you hid the will and the bottle
of chloroform in Sukumar's room...

00:45:16.708 --> 00:45:20.000
You were aware that each room will be
ransacked after this incident...

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.958
Then the Will would be found too...

00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:25.921
You planned to kill two
birds with one stone...

00:45:26.916 --> 00:45:30.142
Firstly, Sukumar would be hanged and on the
other hand you would inherit the property...

00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:31.166
Isn't it so?

00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:36.625
Have you thrown the thimble away?

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.041
Give me some time Byomkesh Babu...

00:45:41.458 --> 00:45:43.625
I'm not feeling very well...

00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:45.958
Get ready.

00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:52.750
(weeping) - You're not paying
attention, I'm asking you something...

00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:53.208
What is he saying?

00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:54.874
Who asked you to get the chloroform?

00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:56.582
Tell me now!

00:45:56.583 --> 00:45:57.666
Fani asked me to...

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.708
Fani?

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.624
He couldn't sleep at night,
one drop of chloroform would help so...

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:03.500
You think this is some kind of joke?

00:46:03.583 --> 00:46:04.642
Chloroform is no sleeping pill...

00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:05.750
Bidhubabu, let him go..

00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:10.458
Byomkesh Babu...

00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:12.791
What exactly do you mean to suggest?

00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:14.392
Once you're saying to take him in custody,
again you're saying to let him go...

00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:17.177
Never meant to take him in custody,
just asked you to play with him...

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.874
What is the matter...

00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:20.791
Listen Byomkesh Babu...

00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:23.749
Just because you are in good
terms with the commissioner...

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.208
You can't always...

00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:28.875
Mock and joke with me and get by...

00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:32.083
Tell me honestly,
who is the actual murderer of Karali Babu?

00:48:07.916 --> 00:48:10.416
Byomkesh Babu, I'll take your leave then...

00:48:10.583 --> 00:48:12.250
I'm an useless cripple...

00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:14.749
No one will help me sustain here...

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.166
I didn't get the money, hence
find no reason to be alive...

00:48:19.458 --> 00:48:21.166
Uncle didn't love me...

00:48:22.708 --> 00:48:24.583
Instead ridiculed me for being a cripple...

00:48:25.375 --> 00:48:28.500
Therefore I have no guilt
for murdering him...

00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:31.208
But I feel apologetic to Sukumar...

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:35.000
Apart from him, I couldn't
have framed another...

00:48:35.916 --> 00:48:37.541
Also, if Sukumar was hanged...

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.125
It would have been beneficial
for me in another way...

00:48:40.333 --> 00:48:43.207
But the embarrassment of being a cripple...

00:48:43.208 --> 00:48:46.041
restrained me from
expressing it to anyone.

00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:49.500
I'll not express it today as well...

00:48:50.458 --> 00:48:54.375
I had stolen the thimble and the
needle from Satyabati's room...

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.875
No one could have gotten
me caught except you...

00:49:00.291 --> 00:49:04.375
But I still couldn't detest you...

00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:07.541
Farewell.

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.291
So Byomkesh...

00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:26.958
Where do you go everyday all decked up,
that too at the same time...

00:49:27.541 --> 00:49:29.208
Any new case?

00:49:29.958 --> 00:49:31.833
Hmm but a rather secret one...

00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:34.708
Your new client seems epicurean...

00:49:34.791 --> 00:49:37.374
Chosen a detective wearing Nehru
Coat (Waist coat), Panjabi...

00:49:37.375 --> 00:49:39.958
Oops! Truth seeker...

00:49:40.166 --> 00:49:42.250
Seeking the truth isn't
an easy task, Ajit...

00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:44.333
You need to be well prepared for that.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.750
Well, you have been seeking the
truth for quite a while...

00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:50.624
Never seen you in this attire...

00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:52.185
It's a different kind of truth, Ajit...

00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:54.142
A bachelor like you won't
be able to figure it out.

00:49:54.166 --> 00:49:55.833
You're right actually...

00:49:56.375 --> 00:49:59.333
Hey! But you didn't give me a
solution for the Tarantula mystery...

00:50:00.291 --> 00:50:02.124
Did you find out the color
of Nandadula Babu's tongue?

00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:03.083
Red.

00:50:03.084 --> 00:50:05.041
That is it, it is solved.

00:50:05.083 --> 00:50:06.125
What is solved?

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.375
Ajit, you still couldn't understand?

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:11.750
Okay, listen...

00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:13.332
You ask Mohan Babu or Arun Babu...

00:50:13.333 --> 00:50:18.750
To get rid of the red ink pot and the fountain
pen from his room, that will be enough.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:45.166
The red ink pot contains
the Tarantula toxin...

00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:48.750
But who is getting it from outside?

00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:50.625
Think harder, you'll understand.

00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:15.833
The peon?

00:51:19.125 --> 00:51:20.624
And why the money order?

00:51:20.625 --> 00:51:22.458
Oh Ajit, use your brain...

00:51:25.125 --> 00:51:27.333
To pay for the substance.

00:51:28.083 --> 00:51:29.707
That's like it, you've
understood everything...

00:51:29.708 --> 00:51:32.000
Listen Ajit, let me tell
you something important...

00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:33.125
For the next few days...

00:51:33.166 --> 00:51:35.999
I'll be extremely busy regarding
a very important case...

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.582
To seek a truth...

00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.457
In the meantime if any new case arises...

00:51:39.458 --> 00:51:41.250
I'd expect you to resolve it yourself...

00:51:41.291 --> 00:51:41.916
Goodbye then.

00:51:41.917 --> 00:51:43.208
What do you mean?

00:51:44.958 --> 00:51:46.517
The meaning is really profound, Mr.
Banerjee...

00:51:46.541 --> 00:51:47.541
Bye.

00:51:59.208 --> 00:52:00.250
Do you...

00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:04.416
Do you like mystery?

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:05.750
What?

00:52:05.958 --> 00:52:07.833
If you have to spend the
rest of your life...

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:11.500
amidst murderers, frauds and imposters...

00:52:11.625 --> 00:52:13.040
on account of your partner...

00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:15.583
how inconvenient that would be for you?

00:52:16.208 --> 00:52:19.333
I am not getting what you are saying...

00:52:20.958 --> 00:52:23.125
In these crucial moments I
can't remember a poem...

00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:28.000
Oh yes, have you heard this poem...

00:52:29.666 --> 00:52:32.416
An ever floating wind impeded the path...

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.375
No No No..wait a minute...

00:52:35.875 --> 00:52:36.875
Yes...

00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:40.041
Unrestrained affiliations
impeded the path...

00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:42.916
We are travellers of the buoyant breeze...

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:46.625
But why are you mentioning The
Last Poem all of a sudden?

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.250
Umm..why The Last Poem?

00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:56.625
For a beginning...

00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:03.416
I mean to say... can I umm to you...

00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:08.083
Umm as in?

00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:11.208
Umm as in marriage...

00:53:14.666 --> 00:53:17.958
Do you wish to marry me?

00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:24.791
You're getting what I mean to say, right?
