WEBVTT

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.166
Sixteen!

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:14.625
Seventeen...

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.250
Have the point.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.416
Eighteen...?

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.291
Leave it...!

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.041
Nineteen.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.458
Twenty..!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Mr. Bashir...!

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:54.666
Someone has come to meet you.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.958
Okay.

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:02.958
You go.

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:09.458
You know Satya...

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:11.915
Spring is the time...

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:14.625
when emotions are brimming.

00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:16.958
Maybe that's why the verses go as..:

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.791
"The scarlet rays of the setting sun... '

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:21.166
'...on a Spring-end day... '

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.083
"I saw in your eyes my...."

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:26.500
Time's up!

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:27.083
What happened..?

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:28.583
It's 5 o' clock...!

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.267
Brother-in-law didn't
get his evening tea...!

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:30.666
Oh no..!

00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:32.708
What 'brother-in-law'...!

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:39.166
Listen....

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:41.208
what about our Kashmir trip...?

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:42.541
Ohh..God..!

00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.083
It's very costly Satya....!

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:45.625
I don't want to hear anything..!

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:46.666
You have to take me there.....!

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:47.208
How? You tell me...?

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:48.448
I hardly have the money needed.

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:49.833
But look outside...!

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.708
The nature's in its full bloom..!

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:53.875
So for now...

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:55.796
..let's imagine Kolkata as our Kashmir...
Okay..?

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.166
Only lyrical words...!

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.041
Let me create Kashmir for you
with these lyrical words...!

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:03.565
"Amidst the daily domestic lives..."

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:06.791
"in everyday's affairs and desires..."

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:12.583
"Here and there, people make
fun of my feelings for you...."

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.416
"In my focus, are your eyes..and my...."

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.458
Time's up..again...!

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:22.957
"The truth-seeker romances..."

00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.416
"and Satyabati neglects...."

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.601
"And here I am... since afternoon..."

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:28.208
"Sighing and begging...."

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.624
"for a cup of tea?! Alas me...!"

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.333
Ohh... no!

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:34.958
Satya please stay...!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.375
Satya..!

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.625
Satya...!
- Leave me!

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:46.082
"Reciting a romantic poem"

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:47.309
Pay attention to these lines, Ajit..!

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.458
Yes yes..I am..!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
"Reciting a romantic poem"

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:02.708
Hmm....

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.240
It's Vidyapati's description...

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.958
Which a bachelor like you
won't understand.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.733
"Leaving crime and criminals, engaging
into amorous affairs...

00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:18.833
"The cupid has struck you..and how!"

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500
Here, brother-in-law...!

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.226
Your husband's character is degrading
due to his poetry obsessions...!

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.250
Mark my prediction...!

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.383
What's this! Why did you
snatch the book away!

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:33.791
Satya!

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:34.166
Give me the book!

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.426
You can't stop me by
snatching it either...!

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:38.351
I'll start again with Michael Madhusudan,
Hemchandra

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:39.666
Tagore, Mohitlal

00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:41.540
Satyen Dutta, Sukumar Sen...

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.875
to contemporary Nazrul,
Buddhadeb, Jibanananda

00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:46.708
Sudhindranath... I'll read every one!

00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.875
Brother-in-law...!
- Hmm?

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:21.833
Seems like your friend is aspiring to
become a poet!

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.083
Imagine how his poems will turn out
sister-in-law..!

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.250
Tremendous..!

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:29.683
Want to hear an example?
- Yes..! Please!

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:30.958
Satya....stop

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:32.083
You stop!

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:33.416
Yes, you carry on!

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:35.166
Yes..!

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.166
"Here and there, bloodstains
everywhere.."

00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:39.083
"I am loosing my sense..."

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:39.583
Wonderful!

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.708
'By collecting the fingerprints...."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.791
"I got the evidence..!"

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:43.916
Amazing...!!

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:45.708
I'll add two more lines..!
- Yes..!

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.790
"Due to the fake property-papers'
case.."

00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:50.666
"cannot find some peace..."

00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.707
"The nephew murdered his uncle,
and got his property,"

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:54.708
"what a masterpiece...!!"

00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.791
Hey where are you going?

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:01.875
Come in!

00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:35.831
So you are Satyanweshi..??

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.583
Please take a seat.

00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:43.166
Tell me, what is the matter?

00:07:45.708 --> 00:07:46.708
There will be.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:47.833
What will happen?

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:49.208
The matter!

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:51.625
Listen!

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:53.291
If I die suddenly...

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.541
I want you to investigate the
cause of my death.

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.166
There are a thousand bucks... count it!

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.378
I might not be able to give you
the fees later..!

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:04.166
That's why now...!

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.500
I want to ask you a
few questions.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:11.606
Whether I'll take this
case or not...

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.416
..depends on your answers.

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:16.416
Go ahead, but I may not
answer some of them.

00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:20.041
Alright...

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.750
What's your name?

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:33.291
Satyakam Das.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:38.500
Just as you are....Satyanweshi.

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:40.666
Address?

00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:43.750
33/34, Amherst Street.

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:45.875
Employed..?

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:47.875
Employer.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.790
Must have heard Das-Choudhury's
"Suchitra Emporium"?

00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:51.791
Hmm..

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.490
I am one of the partners there.

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:58.333
It was founded by my grandfather.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.833
He nominated me as one of the
partners before his death.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.246
Who is the other partner..?

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:08.083
Ushapati Das.

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:09.291
My father.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.500
How old are you?

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:14.250
7th July, 1915.

00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:15.583
My date of birth.

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:17.625
Now calculate...!

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:25.208
And you have other 'qualities' as well..?

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:31.082
Why..? Is that a crime?

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:32.083
Hmm..

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:34.291
You also eye women..?

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:39.301
How many such lives you
have ruined so far..?

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:41.416
I'm thinking of hiring a person for
counting that!

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.125
So you think someone
might murder you.

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.541
Do you suspect anyone...??

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.291
I do.

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:56.333
But I won't reveal the name.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.250
That's it for today.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.875
How would I know if you
are murdered?

00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:05.124
Keep following the newpapers...!

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:06.125
Keep a track of it...

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:07.858
You won't have to wait for long...!

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:28.166
"The ant thrives on the sugar
provided by the Lord"

00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:31.083
My dear sister-in-law, your Kashmir
trip is sorted...!

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.458
Isn't it Byomkesh?

00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:33.583
Hmm..

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:36.791
But I haven't come across such
a shameless young man...!

00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.541
Listen...!

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:40.875
What I could comprehend
from the next room...

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:44.833
The young man gave you the money
for investigating his own murder..!

00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:46.665
With that money... the trip...

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:53.750
Don't pay attention to such eccentric
thoughts of a rich drunkard!

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:54.875
Here... take it.

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.000
But one thing is really strange Ajit.

00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:00.374
He wants investigation of his
approaching murder,

00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:02.255
but doesn't want to stop
it from happening..!

00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:04.083
Absolutely..!

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:05.125
Anyway leave it!

00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:08.249
What's written in the destiny
will happen.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.050
Better I book the tickets for
Kashmir instead.

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:12.083
That's better...

00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.040
I'd better start packing.

00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:14.583
- Let's go.

00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:17.083
Wait..!
- Here we go again...!

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:20.041
We don't have enough woolens
for Kashmir..!

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:24.707
I want blankets, and a coat for me.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:25.333
"I want!"

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.333
I need hundred bucks more for
that Satya.

00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.291
Give...!

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.166
Goodness, she can't wait..!

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:38.458
Let's go Ajit..!
- Where?

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:40.791
Let's get started..! C'mon..!

00:11:43.458 --> 00:11:44.666
Okay..let's...!

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.333
You don't have to worry
about the price.

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.208
The quality is really good.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:50.708
I'll give a discount.

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:53.291
This is not just some fabric..!

00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:54.416
It's Dhakai muslin..!

00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:56.666
You won't get it anywhere
except for our shop.

00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:59.333
Looking for sarees to gift someone
special, Ajit?

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:02.166
One minute.

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:03.166
Just like that..looking.

00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:04.491
I can see how much you are...!

00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:04.916
Hello..!

00:12:05.541 --> 00:12:07.500
Hello.

00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:08.828
So what are you looking for?

00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:14.333
Nothing much. Two blankets and
a Beaver coat for women.

00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:16.625
Sure..come with me.
- Yes

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:18.125
One minute!

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:20.833
I'll attend them.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:23.875
Please go ahead...

00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:32.833
So he's your...

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.250
- Partner!

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Rather your father..!

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.230
You really want to buy, or this is your
investigative method..?

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:43.875
Huhh..?

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.083
No..we want..

00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958
Ajit look.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.541
Beaver coat ...hundred bucks..two
blankets... hundred bucks.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.375
Two hundred bucks..!

00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:28.541
Make that a hundred bucks..!

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:30.333
What!

00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:31.821
Make..that... a hundred bucks..!

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.708
Fifty percent discount!

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:34.833
Hmm

00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.391
Hundred bucks..!
- Yes sure..here you go.

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:44.873
Wait a minute, I'm coming.

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:21.166
Give the money....!

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.000
Oh yes..! Sorry. Take it.

00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.041
Bimal!

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:47.083
Pack them!

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:51.333
Sir!

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:53.208
I need to talk to you.

00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:54.375
Yes..?

00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:56.625
Is she going to pay or..

00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:57.958
Gift!

00:14:58.625 --> 00:14:59.625
Gift!

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.208
But Sir your father gets angry
due to such things...

00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:08.166
Remind him that like him, I am also
fifty percent partner in this shop, ok?

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.500
We're done.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.500
Take it.

00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:21.916
Let's go.

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:24.625
Yes!

00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:31.625
They are really nice..!

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:37.833
It's so good!

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:44.833
Oh my God!

00:15:49.083 --> 00:15:50.083
So beautiful!

00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.291
Madam!

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.416
That fellow Satyakam... you see...

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.375
I mean..you see sister-in-law,
..I'm..going.

00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:37.833
No..I mean..What's the name
of the shop owner...?

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:39.375
Turn around..!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Satyakam Das.

00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:43.291
Yes yes!

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:48.499
Got these items at discount,
just for him.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.500
Really..?

00:16:49.916 --> 00:16:50.916
He's such a nice person!

00:16:51.083 --> 00:16:52.791
Indeed!

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:56.708
But the 'Emporium' will soon become
a 'Memorial' if he isn't murdered.

00:16:58.666 --> 00:16:59.666
By the way...

00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:01.541
Have you yourself chosen these items?

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:02.707
huh..?

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:04.500
Yes.yes..definitely!

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.875
There's water..
- Yes...

00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:13.208
There....

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.707
If only you knew how to give
discounts... Banerjee!

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:17.708
- Hmm..?

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:23.708
What did he whisper?

00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:26.791
He is degrading. He lied!

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:28.666
Mr. Truth-Seeker..!!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:04.833
Brother Byomkesh..!

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.750
Come....this side!

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:17.041
Can you recognise me..?

00:18:19.416 --> 00:18:20.250
Nanda Ghosh!

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:21.458
I stay in your locality!

00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:23.808
Went to collect funds
for Saraswati Puja!

00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:24.958
Oh..I see....

00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:31.000
But why are you in a different locality
at this time, like this..?

00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:35.541
To hit!

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:37.541
Goodness..!!

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:40.125
Whom...?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.833
A young lad of this house!

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.083
Oh really..?
- Yes!

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:46.416
Why so..?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.750
That's a long story.

00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:50.958
But why are you here?

00:18:51.708 --> 00:18:53.068
You know the members
of this house?

00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:54.541
Just one person...

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.500
Maybe that person
is your target!

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.750
Satyakam!

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:02.165
How can I, if he's close to you!

00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:04.458
Not really close...

00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:08.392
Anyway, leave it! Why do you
want to hit him?

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:09.333
What's your reason...??

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:10.958
I told you... it's a long story.

00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:11.916
You want to listen?

00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:12.958
Then come with me!

00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:14.916
Where do we have to go?

00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:15.958
To Bhuteshwar's place!

00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.832
No Byomkesh... not into any
ghostly matters...

00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:19.791
Relax!

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:22.041
Not ghosts! Bhuteshwar wrestler!

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.833
He heads our wrestling arena!

00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:24.958
Come!

00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:26.208
Let's go..!

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.875
Where...?
- C'mon..!

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:30.124
Come come...!!

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:31.666
Which direction?
- This way!

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:37.166
Come...!

00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.416
Come... come..!
Come...!

00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:47.041
Hey..! All good..?

00:19:50.083 --> 00:19:52.625
There..! That way..!
Look....!!

00:19:59.416 --> 00:20:01.541
Budhia..! Well done..!!

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.958
Don't be afraid..!

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:09.124
Come...! Come..come...!

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:12.958
Brilliant..!! Great job Budhia...!

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.083
Just see this...!!

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:24.291
Grab him..!!

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:35.958
Well done!

00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:37.083
There's our Head!

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.541
Come... come come..!

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:43.625
Come...

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.333
Boss!

00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:11.916
Byomkesh Bakshi! Very well known
detective!

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:13.125
Satyanweshi! (Truth-seeker)

00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:14.166
What??

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.333
Nothing...

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:24.166
Are you a policeman?

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.500
Or that fellow's patron?

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:29.500
Byomkesh..let's go home.

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:39.625
Well, Mr. Bhuteshwar... I know Satyakam
for just one day.

00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:42.583
Go and heat up the oil!

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.833
Be it a day, or a year...

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:52.291
If I decide to knock someone down...

00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:55.250
I make sure I do that!
- Definitely..definitely..!

00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:57.416
Can we go home now?

00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:04.791
You see, it's an amazing decision that
you want to beat him up...

00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.716
I just want to know the reason for
doing so..!

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:16.041
He's a scoundrel!

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.250
Ok..

00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:20.166
Teases women anywhere..!

00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.916
This won't happen in our area!

00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:30.791
I'm going.
- Ajit... Ajit..!

00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:45.916
Good..

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.541
Even I do... yoga..

00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:53.208
Often..

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.290
You see Mr. Bhuteshwar...

00:22:55.291 --> 00:23:00.125
I believe few punches are necessary
for Satyakam's activities.

00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:02.375
I'll just request...

00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:05.499
don't kill him...!

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.041
And be careful, don't get caught.

00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:11.041
That's why I will do it brother
Byomkesh!

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.958
Few punches and I'll run away!

00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:16.958
That's not even my locality..so no
problem at all!

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.083
But in case there's any...
inform me, Nanda.

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:24.208
So we may leave now..? Bye.

00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:25.583
Where are you going!

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.291
Home..it's dinner time..

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:31.541
No! - Ok, no dinner!
- Sit! - No, no dinner!

00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:36.916
Sonte!
- Yes boss!

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:41.916
Go and prepare some refreshments
for them!

00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:48.041
Syrup? I love syrups..! My mother
used to...

00:23:48.791 --> 00:23:50.458
prepare daily for me...

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.458
..in the morning.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.125
You'll love it! Have a drink!

00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:54.916
Mother did so..

00:23:57.708 --> 00:24:01.041
Can I hold the club? - Hmm??
- Please be quiet!

00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:03.583
Syrup...!

00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:10.916
Went straight into the tiger's den!

00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:13.791
You said it..!

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:17.082
Their boss is...

00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:19.208
By the way Byomkesh!

00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:22.166
Are you really degrading?
- Why??

00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:24.666
The one who paid you..

00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:26.750
You want him to be beaten up..?

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.790
If his death gets annulled upon being
punched slightly...

00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:32.958
Isn't that good enough?

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.000
And you are talking about my
character..? - Yes!

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.541
Look there..!

00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:41.218
"Characterless" (Movie name)
- Character...!

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:45.416
Byomkesh..! Wait wait!
Listen to me..!

00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:35.041
Ajit!

00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:36.750
Ajit..!

00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:38.875
Ajit c'mon..! Wake up...!

00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:43.500
Here..! Wake up and hold it..!
Take the newspaper..!

00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:46.583
Get ready! I'm going to take a shower.

00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:10.041
"Businessman mysteriously
murdered at midnight!"

00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:13.583
"Ushapati Das's only son Satya..."

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:19.541
"Satyakam Das had a mysterious death."

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.916
"The police are investigating."

00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:23.708
B..Byomkesh!

00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:28.958
Who is it..?

00:27:30.625 --> 00:27:31.625
Hello.

00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:37.375
Yes..tell me..

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I'm sorry...

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:43.625
to disturb you now...

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:50.625
I think... I have seen you both
earlier..but where...

00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:53.540
Is it Suchitra Emporium..?

00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:55.666
- Yes..yes..you are right..

00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:56.749
I'm Byomkesh Bakshi..

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.250
He's my friend Ajit Bandyopadhyay...

00:27:59.291 --> 00:28:00.291
- Yes..but..

00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:07.083
Do you an emergency?

00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:09.999
A mishap actually happened
at our house...

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.125
I know..I know..

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.333
The mishap only brings me here...

00:28:15.375 --> 00:28:18.083
A day before yesterday only I met
Mr. Satyakam.

00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:20.500
He came up to me with a proposal.

00:28:22.458 --> 00:28:23.958
Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:31.875
What proposal..?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.750
Well..he asked me to investigate the cause
if he dies a sudden death.

00:28:39.791 --> 00:28:44.541
I see...Satya perhaps had suspected
something.

00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:49.082
I'm sorry..but why did he
go to you..?

00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:51.124
Are you a policeman?

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.125
No no..!

00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:55.166
Not a policeman..I am a truth-seeker.

00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:02.000
I understood...

00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:05.332
Then did he tell you...

00:29:05.333 --> 00:29:07.833
whom does he suspect...?

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:10.333
No..he didn't take any name.

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:13.458
So once you allow....

00:29:13.916 --> 00:29:15.666
can I proceed with my investigation..?

00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:21.832
Yes..but the police are already doing it...

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:26.250
..can you proceed for any new findings...?

00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:30.291
I don't know if I can..but
I can definitely try...

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:35.041
But what about your fees..?

00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:38.333
- No need. Mr. Satyakam
had already given me.

00:29:42.208 --> 00:29:43.624
But Mr. Byomkesh...!

00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:49.875
Even that won't bring Satyakam back...

00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:56.625
Then why churn the matter...?

00:29:57.458 --> 00:29:58.541
Mr. Ushapati...!

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.916
I can assure you,

00:30:01.291 --> 00:30:03.083
there won't be any such churnings...!

00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:06.083
My only aim is...

00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:08.500
to discover the truth.

00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:13.208
How many people stay here?

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:14.541
Sorry..?

00:30:15.083 --> 00:30:16.803
How many members are
there in the family..?

00:30:19.416 --> 00:30:21.333
Me, my wife...

00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:22.666
Satyakam..

00:30:22.666 --> 00:30:23.666
- He used to...

00:30:23.791 --> 00:30:24.791
Yes..used to..

00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:28.458
..and my nephew and niece...

00:30:28.875 --> 00:30:30.416
Sitangshu and Chumki.

00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:34.458
They are staying here
since a year back...

00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:36.291
A year..?

00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:39.791
Yes... actually..

00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:45.332
My brother-in-law died last year...

00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:47.791
And my sister..it's been
ten years since..

00:30:52.708 --> 00:30:54.208
And who is he...?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.458
He is my father-in-law.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.416
Ramakanta Choudhury.

00:31:01.833 --> 00:31:03.166
Ramakanta Choudhury..?

00:31:04.666 --> 00:31:07.249
It was written "Choudhury
Villa" on the nameplate..

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.790
..so this house belongs to.....

00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:12.500
- Yes you guessed it right.
It was built by him.

00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:18.916
Now Mr. Ushapati, tell me..

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.083
..where do you all stay?

00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:25.125
We stay here only...
- No..!

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.582
Obviously here...

00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:30.708
I meant, which room belongs
to whom?

00:31:31.208 --> 00:31:34.500
The ones in upstairs... downstairs...

00:31:34.583 --> 00:31:37.333
Front side... backside..like that.

00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:39.750
Ohh... now I got it.

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:43.625
Me and my wife stay upstairs.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:52.250
And downstairs, at the backside..
Sitangshu and Chumki stay.

00:31:53.875 --> 00:31:55.333
..in separate rooms..

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.458
next to each other...

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.250
Oh yes! We have an old servant... Sahodeb!

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:05.041
He sleeps outside..at the courtyard.

00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:09.166
And Satyakam?

00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:10.458
Huhh..?

00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:15.125
This is... his room.

00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:20.916
Why did he stay downstairs?

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:27.666
So that he could freely
execute his activities...

00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:29.208
Uncle!
- Yes..?

00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:34.166
No..I won't drink it now.
Please take it...

00:32:37.375 --> 00:32:38.375
Chumki.

00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:40.541
Hmmm....

00:32:42.208 --> 00:32:47.416
How did you come to know about
yesterday's matter?

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:58.708
It was nearly 1 o'clock at night.
I was sleeping. Suddenly...

00:32:59.583 --> 00:33:01.833
I woke up hearing a strange sound.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.708
I felt it was coming from the
main entrance

00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:10.666
I came running downstairs....

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:21.625
Look Sir..what happened
to junior Master...!

00:33:26.083 --> 00:33:27.291
Byomkesh..!

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.125
So you are Sahodeb...?

00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:40.958
Since how many years you have been
working here?

00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:46.500
He's the oldest member of this house.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:50.375
He's here since my father-in-law's time....

00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:54.000
for almost 35 years.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.833
So yesterday night..you were...

00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:02.541
- I don' know, Sir!
- Let me finish.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.040
When Satyakam knocked at the door,
what were you doing?

00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:09.184
I don't know anything Sir...!

00:34:09.208 --> 00:34:10.125
Try to remember...

00:34:10.126 --> 00:34:12.625
I no nothing Sir...!

00:34:12.791 --> 00:34:13.791
Who is he?

00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:16.541
I don't know...

00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.916
anything Sir...!

00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:22.208
You may go.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.041
Where does your niece stay...?
- Huh...?

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.375
Your uncle told me, you have been
staying here for a year.

00:34:40.875 --> 00:34:42.395
Where were you staying before that...?

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:43.750
In Maniktala.

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.916
In which college do you study?

00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:50.833
And your elder brother?

00:34:56.583 --> 00:35:01.625
When your brother Satyakam used to come
home late at night, could you feel it?

00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:07.000
No.

00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:08.791
I used to fall asleep by then.

00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:18.125
How did you... I mean..
Find your brother Satyakam?

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.916
Did you speak to him?

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:26.750
Okay..!

00:35:27.958 --> 00:35:30.958
When did you come to know about
last night's incident?

00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:33.375
Chumki!

00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:34.833
Chumki!

00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:36.291
Chumki!

00:35:37.875 --> 00:35:39.165
What happened brother?

00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:41.000
Couldn't you hear a loud noise..!

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:42.958
Not at all!

00:35:44.666 --> 00:35:45.625
Come with me!

00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:47.791
What happened brother!

00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:48.708
Brother..?!

00:35:48.708 --> 00:35:49.708
Come with me!

00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:57.833
Hello..hello... Amherst
Street police station?

00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:59.916
I am Ushapati Das.

00:36:00.583 --> 00:36:01.743
Owner of Suchitra Emporium...

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.625
A murder occured in my house...!

00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:06.333
My son.....

00:36:06.708 --> 00:36:08.416
Satyakam.....Das.......!

00:36:10.083 --> 00:36:12.583
Please come fast... thank you!

00:36:12.958 --> 00:36:13.333
Aunty...!

00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:14.541
Go and see her..!

00:36:14.875 --> 00:36:17.000
Uncle....! Uncle...!

00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:18.583
Aunty...!?

00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.166
Brother...!! Brother...!!

00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:23.541
Come here fast..!

00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:41.125
What were you doing last night?

00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.916
I was reading a book at
that time.

00:36:46.875 --> 00:36:49.000
I have a habit of reading till late
at night.

00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:50.791
Which book...?

00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:03.625
Which edition?

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.375
Did you hear the sound of firing?

00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:17.708
Yes... I did hear..

00:37:19.166 --> 00:37:21.082
But I didn't know it was the sound
of firing.

00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:22.963
Does the door of your room stay
closed at night?

00:37:23.125 --> 00:37:24.125
No.

00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:25.708
It stays open.

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:29.125
The one of Chumki's stays closed maybe.

00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:32.083
Yes... because she's a girl!

00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:39.500
Did you step out of the house after
everyone fell asleep?

00:37:42.291 --> 00:37:43.333
Did you...?

00:37:44.916 --> 00:37:45.916
No.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.999
Apart from the main entrance....

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.125
..is there any other way to go
outside..?

00:38:01.625 --> 00:38:03.416
This is the one.

00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:06.625
Did anyone go outside through this way?

00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:08.833
No!

00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:11.708
I would have heard... if anyone did so.

00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:13.541
I stay just beside it.

00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:16.458
Only you went out.

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:18.625
No!

00:38:18.958 --> 00:38:19.916
Are you speaking the truth?

00:38:19.917 --> 00:38:21.750
I told you I didn't go out!

00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:24.083
Okay...

00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:28.290
When Satyakam used to come late at night,

00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:30.416
..could you sense it?

00:38:30.833 --> 00:38:31.291
I could.....

00:38:31.583 --> 00:38:32.832
sometimes.

00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:33.915
Not always.

00:38:33.916 --> 00:38:35.250
"sometimes..."!

00:38:36.875 --> 00:38:38.583
How was he as a person?

00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:41.708
I mean, how was your relation with him?

00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:55.291
I am given a shelter to stay here.

00:38:57.583 --> 00:38:58.916
"Shelter to stay"!

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.791
Who has the keys to this doorway?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.333
Brother Sahodeb.

00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:15.833
Ok..fine..!

00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:20.416
Now if only Satyakam's mother.....

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.500
- Suchitra!

00:39:22.291 --> 00:39:23.291
Yes..

00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:29.708
Suchitra..is a bit unwell..Hope you
can understand.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.666
And the mishap..

00:39:30.667 --> 00:39:34.458
Quite naturally... but I
won't talk much to her.

00:39:35.125 --> 00:39:36.245
Just one or two questions...

00:39:36.416 --> 00:39:37.041
I got it..

00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:39.458
- Why are you harassing my husband?

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.333
Why did you come here!

00:39:42.334 --> 00:39:47.041
Pardon me madam, my responsibility
brought me here.

00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:49.055
No, you don't have any responsibility here!

00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:50.333
Please leave!

00:39:50.334 --> 00:39:52.791
You don't want to know who murdered
your son?

00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:54.041
No I don't..!

00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:59.583
Spare us..! Please leave!

00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:10.416
Mr. Byomkesh!
- Yes!

00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:13.916
Please don't mind her words...
- No no... I understand.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.280
Even I shouldn't have done this.

00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:18.625
Okay..bye..
- Bye.

00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:20.333
Let's go.

00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:27.083
What happened?

00:40:35.875 --> 00:40:36.958
Who's it?

00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:38.583
What's the matter...

00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:40.374
Let me see..! Let me just....

00:40:40.375 --> 00:40:41.375
yes...

00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:49.875
Can't take it out...!

00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:52.041
Hmm..it was glued not so long ago..

00:40:53.666 --> 00:40:56.375
Had there been kids in the house,
it would have made some sense...

00:40:57.166 --> 00:40:58.125
Do you know anything about this?

00:40:58.125 --> 00:40:58.750
No..!

00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:01.041
But Sahodeb might.

00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:02.375
Sahodeb!

00:41:11.958 --> 00:41:13.083
He knows about it!

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:18.625
I don't know anything Sir...!

00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:24.208
It wasn't there when I came home
yesterday evening......

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And you...??

00:41:32.583 --> 00:41:33.958
You both go inside.

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.166
Come, let's go Chumki.

00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:42.291
On the night of the murder....

00:41:42.292 --> 00:41:44.708
..the foil paper grew up by itself
on the door...??

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:53.208
What do you get from it Ajit?

00:41:55.125 --> 00:41:56.708
Bye Mr. Ushapati..!
- Ok..

00:41:56.958 --> 00:41:57.958
C'mon..

00:42:09.416 --> 00:42:10.041
Thank God!

00:42:10.042 --> 00:42:12.842
We'll get to see Test cricket matches in
our very own Eden Gardens...!

00:42:13.541 --> 00:42:15.625
Our team will now reply back!

00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:17.624
We are weak in pace bowling though...

00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:21.041
England (opponent Cricket team) doesn't
know the spin bowling technique as well!

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:23.666
So what? The match will be a
neck-to-neck fight..!

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.290
See, Team India has a draw. - Right!

00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:28.333
Byomkesh!
- Yes!

00:42:28.458 --> 00:42:30.916
Did you find anyone mourning
in the family?

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.083
Sorrow more or less turns one stoical...
as the saying goes.

00:42:35.625 --> 00:42:40.249
True, but Mr. Ushapati and his wife
didn't seem stoical even.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.958
Hmm...

00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:44.333
Satyakam didn't have a good character..
But he was their only son.

00:42:44.666 --> 00:42:46.208
Atleast some amount of mourning for...

00:42:53.333 --> 00:42:55.958
Did you find his parents grieving at all..?

00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:57.208
I think...

00:42:57.209 --> 00:42:59.290
..there's something utterly wrong
with the family.

00:42:59.291 --> 00:43:01.371
Absolutely! It's Satyakam who's
the family's mistake!

00:43:03.916 --> 00:43:05.458
And the foilpaper on the door...?

00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:12.833
It might be coincidental...
and if it's not...

00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:13.875
Hmm..?

00:43:17.166 --> 00:43:18.666
Come..let's go to the police station!

00:43:19.458 --> 00:43:21.625
Police station? Ok..let's go..!

00:43:37.125 --> 00:43:38.083
What's the matter?

00:43:38.125 --> 00:43:39.125
At such an early hour?

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.416
Satyakam Das....

00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:42.666
God...!

00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:45.000
Tell me why the hell are you
getting involved in this case!

00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:47.291
Circumstances..Mr.Bhabani...!

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.875
But first tell me, the
lady who just went...

00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:52.291
That woman!

00:43:53.416 --> 00:43:55.957
She's one of the designated
desires of Satyakam Das!

00:43:55.958 --> 00:43:56.541
Alright..!

00:43:56.542 --> 00:43:58.708
Madam Annapurna!

00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:01.416
She's a femme fatale!

00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:02.833
Anyway....!

00:44:02.875 --> 00:44:05.832
You have some sweets instead of
brainstorming over such petty things.

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:08.791
Oh, thank you!
- Sit..have some sweets!

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:10.750
Thank you!

00:44:13.416 --> 00:44:15.541
Can you gage who is the murderer?

00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:17.375
See Mr. Byomkesh!

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.915
That Satyakam was a loafer...!

00:44:19.916 --> 00:44:25.125
I would have given his murderer a treat,
if I were to give the verdict...!

00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:28.642
Did the post mortem report come?

00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:30.083
No..! It didn't yet!

00:44:30.708 --> 00:44:32.166
He died due to the firing, is it?

00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:35.958
Either revolver, or pistol...

00:44:36.833 --> 00:44:39.624
The bullet entered his body
from behind the left side,

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.457
but didn't come out.

00:44:41.458 --> 00:44:42.999
It's somewhere inside his body.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.125
So the shooter targeted from
Satyakam's back..?

00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:46.958
Hmm..might be.

00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:49.208
Probably hiding in the bushes...!

00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:53.791
The moment Satyakam stood in front of the
door, the shooter fired from his back..!

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.791
I'll definitely give a
treat to the shooter...!

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.690
There's an exercise arena in the
next locality... do you know?

00:45:01.958 --> 00:45:04.125
They are gentlemen... they can't do it.

00:45:06.041 --> 00:45:08.458
Gentlemen... aren't they Ajit...?!

00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:11.208
Gentlemen remined me...

00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:15.083
..of Satyakam's cousin brother, staying
at his house. Have you seen him?

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.958
Yes, I have. He's not a bad person...

00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:21.291
But his father was a revolutionary.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.415
Don't say this to anyone.

00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:27.458
His father was beaten to death
at a police station.

00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:30.416
The OC of that police station
was murdered after a few days.

00:45:30.666 --> 00:45:36.750
I feel this boy murdered
the OC out of revenge.

00:45:37.375 --> 00:45:39.208
There aren't any evidences though....!

00:45:40.166 --> 00:45:42.082
What do you think? Can he murder?

00:45:42.083 --> 00:45:43.603
You can't say anything Mr. Byomkesh..!

00:45:44.166 --> 00:45:46.249
If a disgrace like Satyakam
can exist in this society.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.375
anything can happen!

00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:50.291
But when that disgrace
was being wiped off...

00:45:50.666 --> 00:45:52.791
I mean, when Satyakam was murdered...

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.500
Sitangshu was inside the
house at that time.

00:45:55.666 --> 00:45:57.874
And the firing took place outside
the house...!

00:45:57.875 --> 00:45:59.040
That justifies it!

00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:01.749
Right... right..! And moreover...

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.332
..there isn't any proof against Sitangshu
that states...

00:46:03.333 --> 00:46:05.458
he was outside that night.

00:46:05.708 --> 00:46:08.791
You think Satyakam didn't have any enemies?

00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:10.874
The moment he stepped out
of the house...

00:46:10.875 --> 00:46:13.458
he transformed into devil..!

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.500
..right..!

00:46:15.291 --> 00:46:18.750
By the way, his belongings
when he died... those...

00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:22.833
Come! I'll show you.
- Yes, please.

00:46:30.666 --> 00:46:33.666
You continue wearing your belt... we'll go,
have a look and come back...!

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:34.750
Continue with belt...?

00:46:35.708 --> 00:46:36.708
Let's go..!

00:47:12.666 --> 00:47:15.166
Our boss (Bhuteshwar) left for Benares
today morning!

00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:16.791
Straight to Benares..!
- Yes!

00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:18.832
When I came to do the cleaning..

00:47:18.833 --> 00:47:20.290
I saw him reading the newspaper...

00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:21.624
After I went and fetched him
some water...

00:47:21.625 --> 00:47:23.374
..I saw he was already dressed to go.

00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:26.416
He told me, "I am going to Benares.
Inform my boys."

00:47:26.708 --> 00:47:29.708
So I informed you..!

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.291
Come Ajit! Let's go...!!

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:35.750
And come fast..!!
- Yes..!

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:00.208
Nanda... Nanda please!

00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:03.061
Don't make us run after you anymore..!

00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:05.375
What's your motive..?

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.220
The motive of you and your Bhuteshwar Sir's...?

00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:07.875
Why are you two trying to escape?

00:49:07.876 --> 00:49:10.000
What's there to get scared?

00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:12.707
Escaping??? Not... at all...!

00:49:12.708 --> 00:49:14.582
I am here only..!

00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:17.791
I saw you... just now...
brother Byomkesh...!

00:49:17.916 --> 00:49:20.916
Oh really...!
- Y..yes...!

00:49:21.916 --> 00:49:24.916
Even I saw you just now..!
- Oh...

00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:26.957
Good afternoon Nanda..!
- Yes... good after...

00:49:26.958 --> 00:49:28.707
- By the way Nanda...!

00:49:28.708 --> 00:49:33.000
What did your boss see
in today's newspaper,

00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:35.958
..that he headed straight for Benares..?

00:49:38.583 --> 00:49:40.208
You see..brother Byomkesh...

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:44.750
Boss got Divine Benediction
in his dreams...

00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:45.375
God said...

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.208
God said..."Bhuteshwar, come to
Benares and worship me...!"

00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:51.791
Is that what you meant..?

00:49:52.583 --> 00:49:56.125
He who prays a lot has some dishonesty
within... perhaps you know that..!

00:49:56.333 --> 00:49:57.458
Boss is gone...

00:49:58.083 --> 00:49:59.124
Now what if you....

00:49:59.125 --> 00:50:01.625
end up getting all the blames,
Mr. Nanda Ghosh..?

00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:07.750
No no..! Brother Byomkesh! No...!

00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:09.708
I'll speak out everything..!

00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:13.333
Whatever I know... every... everything...!

00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:41.290
The man who came to sell the pistol...

00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.249
do you....know him...?

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.125
No!

00:50:44.126 --> 00:50:46.500
Did Bhuteshwar purchase it..?
- Don't know...

00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:48.083
Atleast not in front of us.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.707
But we didn't want to
kill Satyakam, we just...

00:50:49.708 --> 00:50:51.833
wanted to punch him! Believe me!

00:50:51.958 --> 00:50:54.958
Have some tea. - Take it!
- Yes..!

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.750
Nanda..?
- Yes....!

00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:01.833
Satyakam had ruined many
women's' lives right?

00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:03.208
Yes!

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:08.791
You must be knowing about his
relations with some of them...

00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:14.375
Not everyone...

00:51:14.791 --> 00:51:17.582
But Mr. Akhil staying on the other lane,

00:51:17.583 --> 00:51:19.625
..came to us to complain about him!

00:51:19.958 --> 00:51:22.957
About his daughter Subala.
And...

00:51:22.958 --> 00:51:26.875
Mr. Rameshwar's granddaughter?
That incident is shameful..!

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.208
Want to listen brother...??

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:34.875
No... not their incidents...

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:37.666
Anyone else...?

00:51:38.041 --> 00:51:39.708
Uhh...

00:51:39.833 --> 00:51:42.791
And Mr. Bhabani's daughter Salila...!

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:43.541
Which Mr. Bhabani..??

00:51:43.666 --> 00:51:45.586
The police inspector from
the other locality...!

00:51:45.916 --> 00:51:47.874
He sent his daughter to her uncle's house
due to Satyakam's activities...

00:51:47.875 --> 00:51:50.000
We have information!

00:51:52.958 --> 00:51:53.958
Okay... that's wonderful!

00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:56.083
So according to you....

00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:59.416
there were no dearth of enemies
in Satyakam's life.

00:51:59.875 --> 00:52:00.291
Thank you!

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.666
For telling us so many
things Nanda....

00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:05.916
except....

00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:08.416
where you were yesterday night...!

00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:10.916
Uhh... m..me?

00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:13.583
Yes Mr. Nanda Ghosh..you!

00:52:14.833 --> 00:52:15.541
I was...

00:52:15.542 --> 00:52:17.666
- Ajit where do you think he was..?

00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:21.124
I think....

00:52:21.125 --> 00:52:22.875
with that pistol...

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.124
he was pointing at Satyakam's house...

00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:25.958
- No brother Ajit...!

00:52:25.959 --> 00:52:29.332
What are you saying! No no..!
I didn't murder!

00:52:29.333 --> 00:52:31.207
I've never touched pistol...!

00:52:31.208 --> 00:52:31.875
Listen Nanda!

00:52:32.083 --> 00:52:35.874
I believe either you murdered him
last night,

00:52:35.875 --> 00:52:37.124
or you witnessed it..!

00:52:37.125 --> 00:52:40.000
Because you were present at the spot!

00:52:40.041 --> 00:52:41.749
Now you say, what will you prefer..!

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:42.458
To be hanged till death....?

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:44.583
Or be the prime witness....?

00:52:44.833 --> 00:52:47.833
Speak up...! Speak out...!

00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:52.458
I swear I don't know
anything brother Byomkesh!

00:52:52.625 --> 00:52:55.333
I didn't murder him!
Believe me!

00:52:55.375 --> 00:52:59.541
I ran away after seeing that
car approaching..! - Car..!!

00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:03.040
Which car..??

00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:06.041
Yesterday around midnight.. a car came...

00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:09.083
to drop Satyakam.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:10.791
A car around midnight....?

00:53:11.125 --> 00:53:11.750
Who else was in the car?

00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:14.082
- I don't know...! I didn't murder!

00:53:14.083 --> 00:53:15.708
I swear on God..!!

00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:19.666
Car....??
