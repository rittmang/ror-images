00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.240
<i>I'm looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.520
<i>Because of him</i>

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.600
<i>My sky is full of stars at night</i>

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.280
<i>Flowers bloom in the morn</i>

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.600
<i>In the forest</i>

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.240
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.080
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.640
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.120
<i>It has been five years...</i>

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.520
<i>since our country has been independent.</i>

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.880
<i>The backdrop of our story...</i>

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.000
<i>is the worst chapter of our freedom
struggle... The Partition.</i>

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.280
<i>During the Partition, leaders
from India and Pakistan...</i>

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.000
<i> were given the responsibility
to divide the land.</i>

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.640
<i>One such political leader was
Santosh Samaddar.</i>

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.440
<i>He was appointed to look into
the interests of India.</i>

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.080
<i>Santosh Samaddar's house
was in our neighbourhood.</i>

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.360
<i>An over-smart boy called Nengti Dutta...</i>

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.440
<i>was given shelter
at Santosh Samaddar's house.</i>

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.920
<i>When he read Byomkesh's interview
in the newspaper...</i>

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.120
<i>Nengti came over
and got close to Byomkesh.</i>

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.680
<i>The boy was over-smart but intelligent.</i>

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320
<i>Don't know why Byomkesh
indulges him.</i>

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
You're quite good
at solving crime, Byomkesh.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.880
But you need to understand
the criminal's mind better.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.360
Why does someone become a murderer?
His social conditions...

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.720
You must understand these factors.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.920
Check.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.240
-You're an experienced player.
-Hmm.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.960
-But you have the potential, Byomkesh.
-Really?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.720
If you study enough,
you could be the Indian Sherlock Holmes.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720
Studying is most important, you see.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.840
People stop studying,
so they can't get ahead in life.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.640
How far have you studied, Nengti?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.960
-Grade eight.
-Wow!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120
-That's enough.
-Really?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.840
Yes. Formal education is nothing.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160
-Hmm.
-One must learn from life.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.520
Right.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.680
Hey, that was a good move.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.840
Can I have a cigarette?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.480
Certainly.
Here you go.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.960
Great.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.440
-A light, please.
-Yes.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.000
How old are you, boy?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.680
-I'm about to turn 18.
-Oh, not 18 yet?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.680
And you're smoking with people
double your age?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.240
-So what?
-Huh?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.000
Isn't there a Sanskrit saying...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.040
After 16, father and son become friends.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.360
 -Yes.
-Oh, father and son?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.000
When the father becomes a friend,
why not you?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.520
Check.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.880
How do you smoke at home, Nengti?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.400
How can I?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.120
Aunty doesn't give me any money.
Too many people around.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.840
-That's why you smoke here?
-I guess so.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.680
-It's all cool abroad?
-I've heard the same.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.200
-Do you have a problem?
-Not at all.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.400
Hmmph!

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.040
-There goes your bishop, Byomkesh.
-Hmm.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.760
Guess what,
a girl has come to stay with us.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.400
She's what they call a sexy lady.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.880
Hey, boy!
You think we're your buddies?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.400
Ajit, you vowed to stay
a bachelor all your life.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.720
How would you know
what sex appeal is?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.520
-How would he know?
-Yeah.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.840
If you see her,
your eyes will pop out!

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.800
So who's this sexy lady?

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.600
Uncle's friend's daughter.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.040
Henna Mullick.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.760
<i>There's a sparkle in my eyes</i>

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.240
<i>Because of him</i>

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.000
<i>There's a sparkle in my eyes</i>

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.000
<i>The amusing beauty
The plethora of colours</i>

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.720
<i>She's from East Pakistan.</i>

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.920
<i>Her parents died in a Hindu-Muslim riot.</i>

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.680
She somehow managed to escape.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.880
Uncle has given her shelter.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.360
Just like me.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.680
Santosh Samaddar is a wealthy businessman.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.280
He was part of
the independence struggle.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.000
Your uncle must be very fond of you.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.040
We don't really talk much.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.800
Who'd talk to an over smart boy like you?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.280
He hardly speaks to anyone
at home, Ajit.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.600
Why?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.080
Uncle doesn't spend
much time at home.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.080
He's mostly out for work.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.760
Every Saturday he goes somewhere
after office.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.560
And returns home on Monday after office.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm sure your aunt loves you very much.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280
She's usually calm but strict.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.440
<i>She and Uncle had a peaceful married life
for a few years.</i>

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.920
<i>Then Aunty's
obsessive-compulsive nature became worse.</i>

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.320
<i>She doesn't allow fish and meat
in the house, no servants either...</i>

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.240
<i>They just live in the same house.
Nothing else.</i>

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.360
How long has it been this way?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.760
About 10 years.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.080
Santosh has two sons.
What are they like?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.640
<i>Jugal is the naive sort.</i>

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.840
<i>He writes poetry.</i>

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.680
<i>Uday is quick tempered.</i>

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.960
<i>He eats meat at the club
against his mother's will.</i>

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.600
-Who does your aunt love more?
-Uday, I think.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.320
You can bring your sister here.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.360
Chingri?
She doesn't have the time.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.440
She manages the household by herself.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.360
<i>Aunty spends most of her time
in the bathroom.</i>

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.760
<i>But she's very fond of her.</i>

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.880
-How long have you and Chingri been here?
-Two years.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.760
Our parents died of cholera.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.160
Then Aunty brought us here.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.320
So, it's Santosh, your aunt...

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.800
-...you, Chingri, Uday and Jugal.
-Yes.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.480
-Does anyone else stay in the house?
-Yes.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.680
-Who?
-Uncle's secretary, Ravi Verma.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.600
<i>I've heard he's from East Pakistan.
He's like Ajit.</i>

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.520
Unmarried and lives alone.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.040
He looks into the office
and household both.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
<i>Why am I...</i>

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.080
-telling you all this?
-Why?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.440
I think something bad might happen
 very soon.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.320
-Why do you suspect so?
-No reason. Just like that.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.560
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.920
It always happens
in detective stories.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.640
Wouldn't it be nice if it happens?
You can earn a buck.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.520
That's right.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.920
<i>All India Radio, Kolkata.</i>

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.520
<i>It's June 20, Saturday.
Ramdulal Dey reading the news.</i>

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.320
<i>Today's breaking news.</i>

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.840
<i>The Jawaharlal Nehru government which won
the first elections completed one month.</i>

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.400
You're a saviour, Satyabati!

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.720
Hmmph!

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.800
Bengali writers these days
have forgotten the language.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.560
Just like our country after Independence,
they're doing whatever they want too.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600
<i>A Pakistan Airlines airplane
flying from Chittagong to Kolkata...</i>

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.320
<i>crashed in the Bay of Bengal.</i>

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.720
<i>All passengers on board have died.</i>

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.040
<i>The pilot lost control
and caused the accident.</i>

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.360
There, you see?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.920
I was just talking about this.
Pilots are also doing as they please.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
Uff!

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.440
Remember Satyendranath Dutta's
analogy about planes?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.600
Yes, the ant who develops wings
before dying.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.400
Do you know
who Parvati's brother was?

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.680
Huh?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.760
Which Parvati?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.480
Lord Shiva's wife,
daughter of the Himalayas.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.640
-She had a brother?
-Hmm.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.640
-His name was Mount Moinak.
-Wow.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.880
In that era, mountains had wings.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.040
-They could fly wherever they wanted to.
-I see.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.240
Lord Indra, vexed at this,
burnt their wings with thunder.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.840
Mount Moinak was the only one
who escaped.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.840
Then he hid in the ocean
where Lord Rama had built his bridge.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.720
Sometimes he takes a peek above water
and goes back in.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
Like a fugitive!

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.880
Couldn't Lord Indra, king of the gods,
catch Moinak?

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.760
Indra was the king of gods,
not the truth seeker.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.360
Who's calling now?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.360
Hello?

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.920
<i>Hello, Ajit?
Please come over with Byomkesh now.</i>

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.200
<i>Henna Mullick fell off the terrace
and died.</i>

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.680
Huh?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.160
<i>Yes, please hurry!</i>

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.320
I told you!

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.880
When I heard about the family from the boy
I knew something's off.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.040
Henna Mullick fell off the terrace
and died.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.160
-Let's go.
-What do you mean?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.480
Did Santosh call you?

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.480
It's Saturday.
So Santosh won't to be home today.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.040
And Nengti is a family friend too,
so we can go.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.360
Oh, so you will go
to that brat's house?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.960
-Of course, and you'll come too.
-Huh?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.040
We're leaving, Satya.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.040
Satyabati, he called that
brat a family friend! Damn it!

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.520
-Sir.
-Yes.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.080
-Please sign.
-Here?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.080
Yes.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.920
The house is being repaired?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.560
AK Ray?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.480
How are you?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.840
Gosh! Byomkesh!
What brings you here?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.160
Well, Nengti over there.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.320
-Yes.
-He called me.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.040
Ajit, come here.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.800
He's my friend from college,
Atul Krishna Ray, aka...

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.080
-AK Ray.
-AK Ray.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.440
He's my friend Ajit Bandopadhyay.
-Hello.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.840
So...

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.760
Who informed you?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.120
At 6:30 p.m. Santosh's secretary,
Mr. Ravi Verma...

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.080
-Hello.
-He called the police station.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.680
-I came here as soon as I got his call.
-I see.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.040
Let's go outside, shall we?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.520
Yes, let's go.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.120
-Come.
-Hmm.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.200
-Check this side properly.
-Yes, sir.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.600
There's repair work going on.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.400
There are scaffolding
on the other two sides but none this side.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.760
What do you think, doctor?

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.120
Cause of death is the broken vertebrae
near her neck from the fall.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.720
Approximate time of death?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.000
About two and a half hours ago.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.600
Two and a half hours means...

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.280
-At around 6:15 p.m.
-At 6:15 p.m.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.080
Henna used to go to the terrace
every evening.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.080
I think she went today as well
and then...

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.040
<i>You killed Henna.</i>

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.160
-What? Say that again.
-You killed Henna

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.960
-You killed her.
-Brother!

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.520
Uday! Uday, what nonsense is this?
-Brother...

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.280
What do you think?

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.760
Accident?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.680
Look, Byomkesh, that's what I think but...

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.360
Let me tell you something.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.560
Something’s not right about this family.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.720
I know this much.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.800
Uday, no one killed Henna.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.600
She fell off the terrace and died.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.400
-Go to your room. Jugal, let go!
-Brother.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.440
Have you taken everyone's statement?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.680
Yes, everyone's except Santosh's,
the head of the family.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.240
Apparently, he doesn't come home
on weekends.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.080
-Okay.
-Hmm.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.360
-Let's go inside.
-Let's.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.480
<i>You killed Henna.</i>

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.240
-Let go of each other!
-I’m begging you!

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.840
Please go to your room, brother.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.920
-Please, come on.
-Go to your room...

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.680
Hello, my name is Byomkesh Bakshi.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.480
You alleged that your brother
killed Henna Mullick.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.000
Are there any grounds for your claim?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.680
Uday, go to your room.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.280
Go to your room, Uday.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.520
To your room.
Come on!

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.560
Have you searched Henna's room,
AK Ray?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.760
I have. It's quite ordinary.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.520
There isn't much furniture.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.880
Any letters?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.360
I haven't checked thoroughly
but I will on my way out.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.000
-Do you want to take a look?
-Yes, I do.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.640
-Hmm.
-I will...

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.600
Hello.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.920
I came to your house almost uninvited.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.240
Actually, I am Nengti's friend.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.920
He called for me.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.240
I am Byomkesh Bakshi.
You probably don't know me.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.240
But I've heard of you.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.160
Actually, Aunty was feeling scared,
so I called for him.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.720
Hmm.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.560
Are you done here?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.920
We have to move the body.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.400
But you have to identify the body.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
Hmm.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.120
Let's go.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.680
Father...

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.920
Mother...

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.280
Daughter...

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.680
All of them had accidental deaths.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.280
Strange destiny.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.360
May I have a word with you?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.040
<i>What do you want to ask?</i>

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.840
What is Henna's father's name?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.720
Kamal Mullick.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.440
Was he your friend?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.760
Yes...

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.200
I knew him for nearly 15 years.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.560
I had to travel all over the country
on business.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.320
I still have to.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.600
I met Kamal Mullick in Dhaka.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.000
Then we grew closer.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.640
So you must've seen Henna
even before she came to Kolkata?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.160
Several times.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.680
I've known her since
she was three or four.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720
I see.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:51.360
Did Henna's living here
stir things up in your family?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.600
Yes, my wife...

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400
...had objected.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.040
What?

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.440
Go.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.560
This is your room.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.640
Go, sit down.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.120
Chameli...

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.600
This is Henna.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.960
From now on, she will live here.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.120
Do you want to turn our home
into guest house?

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.840
I won't tolerate all this.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.120
Come, Chingri.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.640
-Come!
-That hurts...

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.640
<i>Henna is from Pakistan.</i>

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.120
<i>She doesn't know the customs here.</i>

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.600
<i>My wife kept her out of the kitchen.</i>

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.720
<i> I arranged for her food
from a hotel nearby.</i>

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.320
Did anyone else object to her?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.960
No one else would dare to.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.760
Are you certain that Henna didn't interact
with anyone else in the house?

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.000
She wasn't forbidden
from talking to others but she...

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.800
wasn't very social.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.560
<i>She couldn't handle the shock
of her parents' death.</i>

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.960
<i>She used to keep to herself.</i>

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.160
<i>Hardly left her room.</i>

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.200
<i>Did you know that Henna...</i>

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.280
used to go to the terrace
every evening?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.120
No, I just found out.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.560
How did you get news of her death?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.680
-A phone call.
-Who called you?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.040
-From a friend's guardian.
-Who is this person?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.480
That's a personal matter.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.640
How did this person get the news?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.800
-I called.
-Okay.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.000
So you know this certain someone?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.200
Yes.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.120
I had shared their phone number
only to Ravi.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.440
Tell me, Santosh...

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.040
Where were you at the time?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.280
Is it really necessary, Inspector?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.480
Forgive me but I'm still doubtful
about Henna Mullick's death.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.960
But everyone is saying
 she carelessly fell off the terrace.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.960
Yes but there's always the possibility
that someone pushed her.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.320
So it's very important for us
to know everything.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.040
Who would murder Henna?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.400
And why?

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.720
We don't know that for sure yet but...

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.200
the investigation is on.
I'm sure we'll come to know.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.120
Moreover, Byomkesh will investigate
in his own way.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.480
Very well.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.480
Then let me tell you where I was.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.840
Look, this is my personal secret.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.840
Make sure word doesn't get out.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.800
Be rest assured.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.000
-Okay, let us go outside, Ajit.
-No, please stay.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.360
It's good you're here.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.040
Byomkesh, I'm appointing you
to protect the my family's interests .

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.480
Okay.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.520
Look.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.320
I'm no saint...

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.120
and I blame no one but myself for it.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.080
Although ethical or not,
good or bad...

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.280
"There is nothing either good or bad...

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.320
but thinking makes it so."

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.720
"Hamlet."

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.760
William Shakespeare.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.640
Of my many sins, one is...

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.120
I...

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.920
like listening
to devotional songs.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.640
<i>For a few days,
hide your love...</i>

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.920
<i>For a few days,
hide your love...</i>

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.320
<i>Sukumari is a devotional singer.</i>

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.720
<i>Singing is business for her.</i>

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.120
<i>Ten years ago, I was smitten by her voice.</i>

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.840
I don't have a happy married life.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.320
I was attracted to her.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.560
We gradually...

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.160
became more intimate.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.040
You know
I'm very deeply involved in politics.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.000
I've fought in the war for freedom ...

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.000
Served time in prison...

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.000
I've been beaten up by the police...

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.240
I've donated loads of money
to revolutionaries...

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.160
I've served as a messenger between
the two countries during the Partition.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.360
I have as many foes as friends
in politics.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.360
<i>That's why, I rented a house
under a false name for Sukumari.</i>

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.520
We decided that she would continue
singing from her own house.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.200
But we would spend the weekends together
in the secret house.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.880
<i>I go there after office on Saturdays...</i>

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.400
<i>and on Mondays, I go to office
directly from there.</i>

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.320
<i>I've been going there secretly
for the last 10 years.</i>

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.800
And you did the same today.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.000
Hmm.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.280
What time did you get the call?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.240
At around eight p.m.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.680
I came here right after.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.920
This is my alibi.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.040
Aren't there any servants
in your secret house?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.680
No, I didn't hire anyone on purpose.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.880
<i>Every Saturday afternoon...</i>

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.040
<i>Sukumari cleans the house herself.</i>

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.680
<i>After I leave for office on Mondays,
she locks up and leaves.</i>

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.400
<i>For the rest of the week,
the house is locked.</i>

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.120
Why do you have a telephone
in that house?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.760
Sukumari needs it.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.960
It's a private number.
You won't find it in the directory.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.600
And except for your friend's guardian
no one else has that number?

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.880
No.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.280
And she would never tell anyone.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.720
Sukumari?

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.720
She won't tell anyone either.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.000
Why do you have so much faith
in Sukumari?

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.240
I give her Rs. 1000 a month.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.440
She's not stupid.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.480
She won't dig her own grave.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.080
What were you doing
when you received the call today?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.520
I was listening to her songs.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.560
Very well.
That's all for today.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.600
Will you be going back now...

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.240
No, I won't go back.
I'll stay here.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240
Okay.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.720
Oh and one more thing.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.600
It'll be pointless to try and
 find the secret house.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.200
Oh, no, no.
What are you saying?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.520
We're not curious
about your private life at all.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.520
But I have something to say.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.200
Santosh, I want to speak
to Sukumari once.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.760
I'll give you her address.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.120
Byomkesh, will you represent me
before the police?

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.800
Yes, of course.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.880
Please excuse me now.
I'm feeling very tired.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.240
He doesn't look tired at all.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.800
"Forgive my weariness, Lord..."

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.040
Byomkesh.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.040
It was very vain of him to reveal
his secrets like that.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.400
Say what you will
but the truth sounds bitter.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.520
Why?

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.560
-This gentleman's honesty is his identity.
-Oh.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.720
-AK Ray.
-Yes?

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.440
Let's check Henna Mullick's room.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.720
-Let's go.
-Come on.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.280
Henna's clothes.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440
Wow.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.280
Looks like Henna had fancy taste.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.000
Was the door open when you first arrived?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.480
-No, it was locked.
-Okay.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.560
-I forgot to tell you something, Byomkesh.
-Yes?

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.440
We found a bag next to Henna's mat
on the terrace.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.280
These keys were in the bag.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.280
Is the room always locked?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.720
Looks like it.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.960
Yes?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.560
Henna never left her room open
when she stepped out.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.520
She would lock her room
whenever she went anywhere.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.000
Is that so?

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.440
Did she always do that or
was it because of something that happened?

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.200
From the very beginning.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.080
What are the fives keys for?

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.440
-One is for the door.
-Hmm.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.600
Two keys... see those trunks there?

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.760
-Hmm.
-Two for those.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.840
And the remaining two?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.920
I can't figure it out yet.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.920
-These drawers weren't locked?
-No, they were unlocked. No keys

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.160
What do you think
these two keys are for?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.080
Maybe these keys aren't used anymore.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.040
Sometimes, one loses the lock
but the keys remain in the ring.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.160
True.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.720
-Here you go.
-Hmm.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.120
Do you know what these keys are for, Ravi?

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.400
Sorry, this is the first time
I'm in this room.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.480
I don't know anything.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.280
-For the first time?
-Yes.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.840
Oh...

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.280
Are you looking for something, Byomkesh?

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.240
This rose is fresh.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.880
-Ravi.
-Yes, sir?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.800
Is there a rose bush
in the garden?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.040
Yes.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.120
What do you think, Ajit?

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.320
Someone must have dropped it
through the window.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.760
CHITRABANI

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.800
Hmm, I think so too
but the question is...

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.320
Was Henna in the room at the time or not?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.600
Do you know anything
about this rose, Ravi?

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.600
-AK Ray, I'll check the book shelf...
-Sure.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.880
-Ajit.
-Hmm?

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.360
-This is Henna Mullick.
-No.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.240
It's her, the photo is yellow
because it's old.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.360
It's because the photo is old.
She must be at least 25 years old.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.440
This can't be Henna Mullick.
Maybe her mother...

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.760
Do you know her?

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.760
AK Ray, keep this photo.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.680
We have to show it to Santosh to know
if this is Henna or her mother.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.840
Okay.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.160
Did Henna get any letters, Ravi?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.400
I'm usually at the office
when the mail is delivered.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.880
I don't know.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.120
Nengti and Chingri would know.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.440
-Ajit.
-Yes?

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.000
PADMA PUBLISHERS DHAKA

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.040
Dhaka?

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.600
Dhaka...

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.840
Shrouded...

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.240
-AK Ray.
-Yes.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.680
Let's take a look at the terrace.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.800
-And Ravi?
-Hmm?

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.880
Please don't come along
because you can't help at all.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.360
Come, Ajit.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.800
Please.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.600
(song playing)

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.800
AVM PRODUCTION
GIRL

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.920
CHITRABANI

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.320
<i>In the forest</i>

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:55.040
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.840
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.240
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.400
Here.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.040
-Here you go.
-Yes.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.720
<i>There's a sparkle in my eyes</i>

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.280
<i>Because of him</i>

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.120
<i>There's a sparkle in my eyes</i>

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.800
<i>The amusing beauty
The plethora of colours</i>

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.240
<i>The eternal black and white</i>

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.480
<i>Just because he is with me</i>

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.160
So the terrace door
can be locked from both sides.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.360
-AK Ray, was the door locked when you came?
-Unlocked.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.760
<i>...the southern winds...</i>

00:27:51.960 --> 00:28:01.120
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

<i>-Byomkesh.
-Hmm?</i>

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.600
This boundary wall isn't that low.
I mean, even if Henna leaned over...

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.320
the chances of her falling
are low.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.920
Unless someone pushed her
from behind.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.040
<i>Byomkesh.</i>

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.120
-Hmm?
-Henna's mat and bag are over there.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.880
This isn't a mat, AK Ray.
It's meant specially for praying.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.760

<i>Sways me in melancholy</i>

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.440
<i>In melancholy...</i>

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.240
SIX

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:57.920
<i>He hides in my work

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:04.960
<i>Because he is mine forever</i>

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:16.800
<i>He gives my heart wings</i>

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.320
-Let's go downstairs.
-Okay.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.800

(inaudible conversation)

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.200
Come.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.760
"Quiet the voluble poet for now, my dear!"

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.600
-AK Ray.
-Yes?

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.440
We're leaving now.
We'll go to the police station tomorrow.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.520
Sure.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.200
-Let's go, Ajit.
-Okay.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.080
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.840
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.840
<i>I am looking for the one in my heart</i>

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.520
<i>How will you proceed?</i>

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.360
Don't know yet but something's
definitely wrong about that family.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.520
This Henna Mullick sounds very mysterious.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.920
When there's a queen bee
among so many young men...

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.080
a competition is only natural.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.680
True, but murder...

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.920
What's the motive?

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.520
-You know what I think, Satya?
-Hmm?

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.120
Something else is about to happen
in that house very soon.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.840
What?

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.160
I don't know but...

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.920
something.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.560
When did you find out?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.560
How could we know?
We stay on the first floor.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.000
You stay on this floor.
Didn't you realise?

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.400
I just came to know
in the morning.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.160
Who do you think
could have started the fire?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.280
All the doors downstairs are locked
at night.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.400
Hmm.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.000
Was the window open?

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.920
I don't know.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.400
This was under the staircase.
The petrol's over.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.640
Please hold this.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.120
-I need to talk to you, Nengti.
-Yes.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.480
I can't answer any more questions.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.040
You're the detective.
You'll get paid if you can solve the case.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.680
So figure it out.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.800
What do you want to know?

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.080
The day Henna fell to her death
from the terrace...

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.040
at that time...

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.160
Where were you and what were you doing?

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.240
-I was out for a smoke.
-Hey!

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.920
Is that all you do?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.720
Over-smart character!

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.840
Did you see Henna at the time?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.720
Yes.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.360
<i>When I left a little before 5:30 p.m.
I saw Henna sitting in her room and...</i>

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.000
<i>sewing handkerchiefs.</i>

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.720
When did you return?

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.440
Around 6:15 p.m.
I came back to see Henna lying dead!

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.920
Hey!

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.880
Chingri!

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.840
Madam!

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.200
Uday!

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.080
Did you see anyone in the hall
when you left?

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.080
Yes, Uday.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.760
Did Henna receive any letters, Nengti?

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.040
No.
She didn't.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.880
Whenever the mail arrived, I received it.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.320
I've never seen any letters for Henna.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.680
Was Henna in touch
with anyone from outside?

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.160
No.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.000
I didn't tell you about something.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.200
Thought it's insignificant.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.840
I'll decide if it's insignificant.
Tell me everything, Nengti.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.960
After 10 or 12 days
since Henna arrived...

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.840
I used to notice something
in the evenings...

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.840
A cab.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.520
<i>It used to stop by our house sometimes.</i>

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.160
<i>A man sitting inside
would play the mouth organ.</i>

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.160
<i>He would return after a few minutes again.</i>

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.280
<i>And Henna would leave
10 minutes later.</i>

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.400
Did you ever see the face
of the mouth organ player?

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.200
-No.
-No? Useless!

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.200
Then?

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.760
-Then all quit for 10 or 12 days.
-"Quiet".

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.280
Henna didn't leave the house.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.560
<i>Then the same thing happened again
after a few days.</i>

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.720
So this was a signal?

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.200
I think so.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.800
Seems like an affair.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.800
The next time it happened,
I followed her...

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.600
But the cab left.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.360
<i>So you didn't get to know
where she goes?</i>

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.880
No.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.480
When would Henna return?

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.000
-In an hour.
-When was the last time she left home?

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.080
About 10 or 12 days ago.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.640
That means it happened every 10 or 12 days.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.480
I don't have time
to keep tabs on Henna all day.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.360
I just noticed this a few times.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.760
Let's go, why are you...

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.360
Disgusting!

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.720
So...

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.280
Got to know anything?

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.160
The mouth organ part seems dubious to me.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.800
That means Henna knew someone
in Kolkata.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.720
Anyway, one thing is clear.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.040
That Henna's death was not an accident.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.360
It's a murder.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.440
But who's this mystery man?

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.280
Who do you think?

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.000
The person who burnt all the documents.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.360
Maybe... maybe not.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.520
The motive for murder is not clear.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.840
Well it's...

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.880
You know...

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.240
What do you mean?

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.520
-I mean... that!
-Sexual jealousy?

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.680
-Yes.
-Why didn't you just say so?

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.680
It could be sexual jealousy but...

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.160
Maybe not.
It's not enough of a motive for murder.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.880
Although the motive behind
setting the room on fire is clear.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.160
And what's that?

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.120
There's something very significant
in Henna's room...

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.040
which someone wants to burn.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.760
-But we didn't find anything.
-That was just once.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.840
We could have found something
if we searched again.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.000
Tell me...

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.400
-What significant thing could it be?
-I don't know.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.560
But it's something small...

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.960
I mean some ring, or piece of paper
or something like that...

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.520
-We would find it if it was big.
-Wait, wait, wait.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.880
Didn't you find some paper
in Henna's room?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.640
Yes, where did I keep that?

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.440
Where did I keep it, Satya?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.280
-Check inside the book.
-Hmm.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.120
-This?
-That's it, yes!

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.360
See it.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.360
"A glimpse of your shimmering smile
Stabs like a dagger to the heart.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.680
Your red, red lips
Can punish without fault."

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.720
Hmm... who wrote this strange poem?

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.240
There's only one poet
in that house.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:45.960
Jugal!

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.000
The postmortem report says
it's an accidental death.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.960
So there's no point
in further investigation.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.640
-Sir.
-Hmm.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.440
Do you think so too, AK Ray?

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.360
Not at all, Byomkesh.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.800
But what can I do?

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.560
It's an order from the higher authorities.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.520
We can't continue the investigation.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.840
What about the fire?

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.400
That's just a coincidence.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.480
There's no proof that someone
set fire to the room.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.680
Oh, that reminds me.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.600
Santosh has confirmed that...

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.240
this is Henna's mother.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.600
I had a little something
to tell you, brother.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.800
I was saying...

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.520
Please carry on your investigation.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.880
And if you need any assistance...

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.560
I mean...

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.120
I'm there.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.160
Moreover, Santosh appointed you, isn't it?

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.240
Don't know
if he'd still want me to be on the case.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.560
Let me go visit him.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.480
-Come, Ajit.
-Hmm, let's go.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.800
-Bye, AK Ray.
-Bye.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800
Goodbye.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.400
<i>The fact that Henna's death
is accidental...</i>

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.280
brings me some peace.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.920
But I'm not quite sure
if it was an accident.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.600
Why?

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.120
Did you find any clue?

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.320
All the papers in Henna's room
getting burnt...

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.800
doesn't seem normal to me.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.080
That's true.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.640
Anything else?

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.080
Santosh, did you know that
every few days...

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.440
a cab would pass your house
with an unknown mouth organ player?

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.160
A few minutes after the cab left,
Henna would go out of the house.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.800
As far as I know,
Henna doesn't know anyone here.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.520
Might be someone from Pakistan.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.200
Maybe he would visit Kolkata for work
every 10 or 12 days and meet Henna.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.840
Hmm.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.840
That possible.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.200
What would you like to do?

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.000
I'd like to interrogate everyone
in the house.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.200
See, when the police has closed the case...

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.560
why bother...

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.600
But don't worry, you'll get your fees.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.040
Monetary gain does not gratify
my mind, Santosh.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.600
And it's not in my nature to get more fees
by working for longer.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.320
I simply want to unearth the truth.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.480
Yes but I'm not interested
in the truth anymore.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.000
So you're asking me not to show
any interest in this case either?

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.040
I said I have no interest.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.440
I won't object if you're still interested.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.680
You can carry on with the investigation.
I'll tell everyone at home.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.560
Very well.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.880
-Thank you very much.
-Hmm.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.240
Let's go, Ajit.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.160
Byomkesh, I just can't understand
one thing...

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.480
Why did the police suddenly give up?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.400
Maybe they didn't find
anything significant.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.760
The police can't look into
just this one case.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.040
What are you planning?

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.200
Ajit, there are so many things
in that house.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.880
Why would someone burn the documents
in Henna's room?

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.040
Hmm...

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.840
Something's wrong, Ajit.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.240
-Let's go.
-Yes.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.560
Byomkesh?
