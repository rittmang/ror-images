WEBVTT

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.319
Down with Fascism!
Down with Imperialism!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.919
Down! Down!

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.599
Long live revolution!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.119
Long live! Long live!

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.639
Long live revolution!

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.880
Long live! Long live!

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.240
Comrade?

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.960
Comrade, Manmatha?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.960
You seem distracted these days.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.919
Comrade, can you get me a pistol?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.440
- Pistol?
- Pistol?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.120
Pistol?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.200
Why do you need a pistol, comrade?

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.839
Revolution can't be achieved
with such a restless mind.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.560
- Revolution is a big task.
- Then give it to me...

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.680
I won't waste my time
listening to lectures anymore.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.160
Give it to me.
I can do it.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.240
At the Nazi concentration camps...
Yes... yes...

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.600
what kind of gas?
What is it's chemical composition?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.839
Rats have invaded my house.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.160
I want to destroy them all.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.440
Hmm!

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.720
Much ado about nothing, huh?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.160
Hello? Gautam?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.160
I... I need some hydrocyanic acid.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.080
No... it's for Father's experiments.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.320
Yes... I'll pay
whatever it costs...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.920
Okay.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.999
Indians are not as advanced
when it comes to scientific experiments.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.400
They lack originality.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.000
That this perception is a myth...

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.640
India's glorious past
is enough to prove that.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.319
Mathematics...

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.799
Astrology...

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.119
Diagnosis...

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.239
Architecture...

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.600
The four pillars of Modern Science
took birth in India.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.319
<i>Then why are Indian scientists
lagging behind?</i>

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.559
<i>Think about it...</i>

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.319
<i>There's only one answer to it.</i>

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.559
<i>Poverty...</i>

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.760
<i>The lack of money in the past
was not so prominent</i>

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.879
Keep quiet! It's Father...
Sit down.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.760
<i>This is now the biggest threat
in the field of scientific progress.</i>

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.920
<i>We're going through a dark time.</i>

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.279
<i>Obstacles in scientific progress
is dangerous for mankind.</i>

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.919
<i>Dear child, where are you?</i>

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.079
<i>Scientific progress...</i>

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.159
- Mother is calling me...
- Go then.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.239
<i>Lack of proper eductaion...</i>

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.159
And... bring me the tea.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.079
<i>Look around...</i>

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.439
<i>The pursuit of science is the only way
to deliver us from this darkness.</i>

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.319
<i>We need money for that.
Isn't it?</i>

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.159
<i>Large investments are needed
for radical inventions.</i>

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.319
<i>There's no lack of scientific talents
in this country.</i>

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.519
<i>What we lack is money.</i>

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.639
<i>We need money!
We need investments!</i>

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.720
<i>We need infrastructure!</i>

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.559
<i>Without modern equipment...</i>

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.479
Damn it!

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.400
What happened?

00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:34.159
Turn off the radio right now!

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.559
<i>We have to realise that...</i>

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.119
<i>if lack of capital results
into scientific regression...</i>

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.280
<i>our Indian heritage will...</i>

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.440
Need this... need that...
Needs and wants!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.960
Unbearable bravado!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.319
Jagadish Bose invented the millimeter-wave
in Calcutta University's broken lab.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.879
Satyen Bose is inventing
new theories in Dhaka...

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.959
which even Einstein approves of.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.399
And look at these people...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.319
need this, need that.
Bloody excuses!

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.719
- Here you go.
- You're right.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.319
Beggars can't be choosers.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.720
No, this is fun.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.800
Humans love to make a case
defending their failures.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.320
Messed it up, huh?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.160
The oil was bad.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.839
What's there to laugh about?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.279
You just said...

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.960
"Humans love to make a case
defending their failures."

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.200
Be grateful that
I'm cooking for you, Ajit.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.680
Better keep quiet and eat it!

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
God knows when your wife, Satyabati,
will be back.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.919
Listen, brother...

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.720
- How's her brother now?
- He's recovering.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.319
The doctor has asked him to rest
for a while.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.559
- I told Satya to stay back.
- Well, good advice.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.040
Since the cook isn't here either,
eating is a...

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.399
When you call Satyabati,
please tell her...

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.880
that her brother-in-law
is not well.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.920
Poor dear!

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.039
Instead of depending on my wife
who's your sister-in-law...

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.159
why don't you find this friend of yours,
a sister-in-law?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.599
How long will you spend
your nights alone?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.919
A few days back
I met Shibram at College Street.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.159
You mean, Shibram Chakraborty?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.640
Yes.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.000
Ajit, won't you eat the eggs?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.359
Guess what he said?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.159
I asked him the same question.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.399
Are you going to be a bachelor
all your life?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.720
- Do you know what he said?
- What?

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.799
"Women are distressed
in this country.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800
"So, I chose not to torture
one of them.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.040
- Which one?
- "The one I didn't marry."

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.239
Although we're laughing...

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.519
there's a terrible tragedy
in this humour.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.839
Ajit, take me to
Shibram's mess one day.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.679
- I've always wanted to meet him.
- Sure, I'll take you.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.359
Look at Shibram...
he only demands sweets.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.360
Then there's Debkumar.
Need this... need that!

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.799
How come the father
of a bright lad like Habul...

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.279
give speeches like that?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.159
Who told you that a smart boy
will have a smart father?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.480
And how do you know
he is not intelligent?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.360
Sorry for the delay, sir.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.519
Here's our joint life insurance policy.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.880
A very lucrative policy.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.799
It's a limited period offer.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.159
Don't miss this opportunity.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.599
Yes, I don't want to
lose this opportunity either.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.520
Very well.

00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.400
How much do you want to insure?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.639
Umm...

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.560
Fifty thousand?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.439
- Fifty?
- Yes...

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.719
Sure... why not.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.039
A scientist like you
must have a secured future.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.199
What will be the premium amount?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.399
Please don't worry
about all that.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.279
I'll try my best to give you
a discount.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.079
I guess the policy will be
named after your child?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.359
No, no...

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.239
It's for me and my wife,
Subhra Mitra.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.439
- A joint policy.
- Very well!

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.359
Umm..should I mention
your child as the nominee?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.679
Umm... no.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.360
I don't want any nominee
for this policy.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.880
Is Subhra your second wife?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.280
Yes.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.359
And the child is from
your first marriage?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.439
- Yes.
- That's what I guessed.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.000
How many?

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.519
- A daughter...
- Yes...

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.000
and a son.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.359
Very well.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.519
So if the stepmother
is not taken care of...

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.839
Subhra gets all the money...

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.719
- Mitra, right?
- Yes.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.919
- It's Mitra.
- Okay.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.440
It'll all go to Mrs. Mitra, right?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880
Very well.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.159
He got married
for the second time.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.719
Nothing else proves his foolishness
more than this.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.760
Oh, really?

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.279
Should I tell
Satyabati about this?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.560
You can.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.559
That's the nature of a writer.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.599
What is?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.080
Creating trouble in a friend's life
to find plot points for a story.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.680
Byomkesh!

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.080
Byomkesh!

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.559
What's it, Habul?
Why are you panting?

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.079
Something horrible happened!

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.040
My sister, Rekha...

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.359
You can't give up, Habul.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.240
Come with me.

00:09:43.241 --> 00:09:45.680
What will I do now, Byomkesh?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.759
Father is out of town.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.559
- My sister is all I have.
- Habul... Habul...

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.159
You have to stay calm
during this trying time.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.079
What happened to Rekha?
Did she have any heart problems?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.720
I don't know.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.600
- Did she fall ill recently?
- No.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.039
Okay, come.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.440
Oh, Lord!
How could you do this to me?

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.920
You silly girl!
Your death has killed me too!

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.720
How will I face my husband now?

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.399
Is that your mother?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.560
Hmm.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.799
Dr. Rudra lives near by.
Doesn't he?

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.760
Yes.

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:34.399
Send someone for him then.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.280
- Okay?
- Yes.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.040
Let's go.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.920
Where is the kitchen?

00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:39.520
- This way.
- This way? Come, Ajit.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.920
Oh my God!

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.920
Let's go.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.320
(crowd protesting)

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.679
Come out!
Out at once!

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.480
- Where are you?
- Come out!

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.040
- You have to come out!
- You can't hide.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.999
Law and order still exists
in this country!

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.160
What's the matter?

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.079
What does your father
think of himself?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.519
He can run his deadly tests
on poor people like us?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.599
What's the matter?
Please tell me in details.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.519
My son was suffering
from Tetanus.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.239
Your father has discovered
a new drug to cure it.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.039
He gave it to my son
without testing it.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.639
- My son died the next day!
- Dr. Rudra, come out!

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.959
(people protesting)

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.120
What happened?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.240
Why are you people shouting?

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.719
A new medicine needs to be
tested on someone.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.999
Can you always pass a test?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.439
What do you mean?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.959
Don't you value other's life?

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.959
What would your son do
if he were alive?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.359
He'd either be a freedom fighter
or a thief?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.959
The police would have shot him
like a dog.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.439
He is a martyr for science!

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.039
You should be happy!

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.040
I'll go to the court!

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.799
Do you money to file a case?

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.559
A broke bum like you
will go against me in court?

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.240
You're lucky
that I didn't ask you to pay me!

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.439
Now get out!

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.279
Get out from here!

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.000
He left? How dare he?

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.560
(people protesting)

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.520
She died while lighting a match
for the oven.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.320
Where is she?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.440
Habul, Dr. Rudra is here.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.960
What do you think?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.880
For now... The girl had no idea how close
death was even moments before she died.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.000
But how did this...

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.239
What happened?

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.120
Is she dead?

00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:26.279
Yes. Best if you check once.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.919
And you are?

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.760
Huh?

00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:30.680
Just a neighbour.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.360
This is Debkumar's daughter.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.040
Yes.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.080
- Is her name Rekha?
- Hmm.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.039
Oh God!
Inform the police.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.719
The cause of death is suspicious.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.599
What's the cause of death?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.119
I can't tell without
the autopsy report.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.960
My fees is Rs. 32.
Send it to my house.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.040
Habul...

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.920
Habul...

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.160
- Habul?
- Hmm...

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.840
Which way is Rekha's room?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.440
That... that way...

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.880
Rekha used to take Aspirin?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440
Yes.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.360
She had headaches very often.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.760
Byomkesh, this is life.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.719
Her bed is still warm from last night...

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.000
And yet she has set out
on the eternal journey this morning.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.559
Please control the philosopher in you
under these circumstances.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.760
Insensitive!

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.640
Habul...

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.920
Habul...

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.440
I...

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.159
I knew this would happen.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.200
Rekha would commit suicide.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.880
'To Nontu'.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.440
Who is Nontu?

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.040
Rekha?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.319
Is that a love letter?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.679
No... no...

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.160
- Why didn't you go to college, brother?
- Let me see it.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.959
- What?
- The letter you hid under the pillow.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.399
- No... it's...
- Take it out.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.200
That is...

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:59.399
- Rekha, I'm warning you.
- Brother... that's...

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.839
- Take it out..Rekha...
- No... brother...

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.840
Rekha, don't you...

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.640
Rekha, stop! Rekha...

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.920
No brother...

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.920
Rekha, I'll get you...

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.959
You evil girl!
You broke my bones...

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.239
Your bones won't break that easily.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.399
What?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.080
No... Nothing...

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.959
Hey, you dumb girl...

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.359
How dare you touch me
in dirty clothes?

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.039
You hag! Your touch has made me impure!

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.599
But your father won't see your fault.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.159
It's all my fault.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.719
Let him return.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.680
Either it's my way or the highway!

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.560
Don't!

00:18:38.561 --> 00:18:42.720
- Give me the letter.
- Let me go!

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.399
"My dear Rekha...

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.800
I'll wait for you near your house,
after college tomorrow.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.840
Yours lovingly, Nontu."

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.880
Oh no!

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.320
Now that bloodsucking Dr. Rudra...

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.439
will be our relative?

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.120
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.640
He's Dr. Rudra's son.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.880
Nontu is a good man.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.800
A real good man...

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.760
My son will marry
your daughter...

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.600
Unbelievable!

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.000
Have you heard Wagner?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.520
Famous German composer.
Hitler's favorite!

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.720
Listen to him.
It'll boil your blood.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.920
Dr. Rudra, why don't you ask Nontu?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.239
Nontu likes Rekha.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.559
They'll be happy.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.240
Nontu! Nontu!

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.080
Do you know Rekha?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840
I do.

00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:10.199
Whatever he said...

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.080
Is it true?

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.160
Yes.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.840
That means...

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.080
you know why he's here.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.800
I see.
You may leave.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.040
See, Dr. Rudra...

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.719
Actually, times are changing.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.600
- Our time was different.
- 10,000.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.679
- Beg your pardon?
- Rs. 10,000 as dowry.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.799
Rs. 10,000!

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.360
Where will I get so much money?

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.159
"We can't get married anymore.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.519
Your father wants Rs. 10,000.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.760
My father can't give him
such a huge amount.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.160
Here you go.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.840
Ummm.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.759
Wanted to marry your daughter off
to a doctor's son.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.359
A peasant dreams of
being the king, huh?

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.439
When I asked for a necklace
you didn't care much.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.919
You've always taken me for granted.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.079
But you can go looking for money
for this girl!

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.479
Tell me, where will you get
all that money?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.679
Useless!

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.879
Drawing random pictures
and boiling stupid things all day!

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.919
Don't know what my father saw in you!

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.399
You completely ruined my life!

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.640
A porter is more capable than you.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.439
"I never imagined that our relationship
will fall apart like this.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.600
I'll not give dowry to marry you.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.480
I expected you to protest, at least.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.639
Anyway...

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.920
I know it'll be very difficult for me
to live after this.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.960
I had loved you.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.599
Father, you took
the wrong decision.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.759
I'm not answerable to you
for my decisions.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.399
I've arranged your marriage
with Dr. Ghosh's girl, Sulekha.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.599
Get married to her.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.640
Father, I can't marry anyone
other than Rekha.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.560
Nontu!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.720
Rekha...

00:22:44.721 --> 00:22:47.079
Rekha, hear me out...

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.199
Rekha, I've told my father off.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.240
- Listen to me...
- There's nothing more to say, Nontu.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.680
We're not rich like you
but we still have self-respect.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.039
<i>"You know
I can't marry anyone else.</i>

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.399
<i>But I can't live
in this house anymore.</i>

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.560
<i>Can you give me some poison?"</i>

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.439
"I'm sure you can find some
in the doctor's chamber.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.599
If you don't then
I'll die in some other way.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.719
You know
I always stick to my words.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.840
Yours lovingly, Rekha."

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.640
Can I talk to your mother once?

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.880
Byomkesh...

00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:27.520
- Come, Ajit.
- This way.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.360
What's going on here?

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.080
Can we talk inside?

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.440
Why do are you so eager
to enter a married woman's room?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.880
We can talk here.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.000
You might not know us.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.000
We're your neighbours.

00:23:48.001 --> 00:23:51.280
My name is Byomkesh Bakshi.
I'm a seeker of truth.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.040
I'm not interested
in what you are selling.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.079
No, no, I'm not selling.
I'm seeking.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.400
- Searching...
- You might call it investigating.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.559
Umm... you're clothes are clean, right?

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.199
No... umm... we bathe very early.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.119
- Every day...
- Each and every day.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.639
Please carry on.
I'll be right back.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.199
Where are you going, boy?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.639
Strangers are entering
your mother's room.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.519
You should be here as a witness.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.680
I don't want people
to blame me later.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.600
Come in.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.040
- Come, Habul.
- Come, boy.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.800
Did you see Rekha
in the morning?

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.239
What can I say?

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.439
Our maid did not come today.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.319
So I told Rekha
to clean the kitchen...

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.040
and to light the oven.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.719
But I never force
my stepchildren to work.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.240
I do as much as I can.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.639
But there are so many chores
around the house.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.079
It's not always possible
to do it myself.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.080
Isn't it?

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.879
That's why I told Rekha
to light the oven...

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.599
and went for a bath
after cleaning this room.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.720
I didn't go to the kitchen
after my bath. Then...

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.159
Girl, it's almost noon...

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.799
Is the oven working?

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.439
(chanting)

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.919
Do I have cook all the time?

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.159
(chanting)

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.799
Can't I be spared one day?

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.160
(chanting)

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.680
What's the matter?
Why aren't you answering?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.040
Just because you are his first wife's child,
do you want me to treat you like a doll?

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.999
I was a pampered daughter too.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.640
But my father
never spoiled me like this.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.759
Now if I say this...

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.600
I'll be the bad one.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.880
Why is there no...

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.000
What's wrong with you?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.240
What's the matter, child?
Huh?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.160
Hey, you...

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.600
Oh my God!

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.600
Habul... Habul!

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.320
What is it?

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.160
Rekha?

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.040
Re...

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.639
<i>Believe me...</i>

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.960
<i>I've never interfered
in anyone's life.</i>

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.719
My rotten luck!
I'm involved in this mess.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.359
I'm the stepmother after all!

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.200
People will blame me, right?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.280
My husband will not spare me.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.079
God knows what he'll do.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.680
He can't stand me.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.079
Whatever I say irritates him.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.919
Who? Debkumar?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.319
Who else can it be?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.440
I see.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.320
Did you say anything hurtful
to Rekha today?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.719
- Hurtful words?
- Yes...

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.199
Never.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.719
I never say anything hurtful.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.720
I'm not that sort of a person.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.039
I'm living with stepchildren
from the very beginning.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.719
No one can say
I've treated them badly.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.280
Never ever.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760
But yes...

00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:39.400
I told Rekha to light up the oven.
That's all.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600
<i>Mother...</i>

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.240
Speak up.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.200
I can't find the matchbox
in the kitchen.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.320
May I take yours?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.920
What else! Take it.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.600
But keep it back in its place.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:02.999
Oh, God! You messed up the room.
What's wrong with you?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.720
I just cleaned room.
Now I have to do it again.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.520
Leave.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.320
I want it back once you're done.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.200
Of course.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.080
Why did Rekha come to you
for a matchbox?

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.640
Do you keep the matchboxes here?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.520
Yes... actually...

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.600
I can't sleep alone
in the dark at night.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.760
If there was someone...

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.359
That's why...

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.760
I keep the lamp burning all night.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.199
That's where I keep
the matchbox.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.840
Where? Where?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.160
There?

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.560
Yes.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.160
Would you like some tea?

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.600
No, not now.
We better go now.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.400
Tea would've been fine.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.279
- What's wrong?
- You're too much, Ajit.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.040
I'll make you tea at home...

00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:17.359
- She was being so nice to you.
- Again?

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.599
And did you see her face?

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.280
It was so unhappy.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.599
- But you...
- It's natural, Ajit.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.720
She's childless. So she doesn't love
her stepchildren.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.239
You have feelings for her it seems.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.239
Her marital life isn't very
satisfying either I think.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.400
Oh, God!
That's very obvious.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.760
That's why
she rebukes the children.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.240
Oh!

00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:44.519
See if Freud or Jung came up
with any theories about this.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.559
- You mean 'Oedipus complex'?
- What?

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.960
What rubbish are you...

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.879
- Where there is fear...
- Darkness follows!

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880
Absolutely.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.000
So... Then...

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.519
You two are here as well?

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.360
What to do, Bidhu?

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:59.159
It'sour duty
to help our neighbours.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.119
How come the Deputy Commissioner
is here in person?

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.079
Whenever there's a
complicated case, there's...

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.159
The buffoon...

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.560
Umm... Bidhu.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.760
Did you find anything?

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.279
Nothing much.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.239
But when you're inquiring
I'm sure there'll be a lot.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.119
But for now...

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.920
I'm taking this matchbox
from the house.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.600
Only a matchbox.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.840
Matchbox, huh?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.440
Gojanan, follow me.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.680
Suicide?

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.560
What do you think?

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.440
What's your opinion?

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.079
The letter suggests suicide.
I mean...

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.840
the intent is clearly there.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.800
Hmm.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.080
And how did she kill herself?

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.880
With poison.
That's what the letter says.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.360
Poison...

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.280
How can she kill herself with poison
before even getting it?

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.080
Rekha aksed for poison
in the letter.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.799
But the letter was not posted.
It remained under her pillow.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.320
Then where did she get the poison
to commit suicide?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.480
But she also mentioned
other ways...

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.800
But why try another way
even before sending the letter?

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.240
And no one commits suicide
while lighting an oven, Ajit.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.080
Rekha died suddenly.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.840
The murder weapon was
so fast and sure...

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.640
she didn't even get a chance
to move.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.880
The matchstick turned to ash
in her hand.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.680
What if her heart failed?

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.040
No idea... only...

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.400
hydrocyanic acid has such power.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.600
It's possible.
The aspirin made her heart weak.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.120
This death is not that easy, Ajit.
There's something very wrong.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.760
Make me some tea, my friend.
Need to soak my brain.
