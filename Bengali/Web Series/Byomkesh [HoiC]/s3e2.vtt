WEBVTT

00:00:05.417 --> 00:00:08.042
It's unbelievable!

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.291
I've been into this profession
of Medicine for 20 years...

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:13.917
I've never been a witness to such
unnatural incidents.

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:17.875
However, such cases are there
in medical books!

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.583
But coming across
such cases, is rare!

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.874
Even if I deal with mysteries...

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.542
you've left me speechless!

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.417
Finally, I got a case,
I'd enjoy while investigating.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.042
- Start from the beginning!

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:50.042
That man is born with his
heart on the right side...

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.624
And the porcupine quill
was stabbed on the left side...

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:53.625
piercing his lungs.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.207
As long as the quill is there,

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:57.792
blood won't ooze out...

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:01.082
But he might die
due to excess blood loss,

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.333
if I try to surgically remove it.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.125
Anyway,

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.750
I removed it carefully...

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:11.500
The quill was
deep inside his body...

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.390
This is the fourth case
that came to me...

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.542
And then?

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.792
Luckily there wasn't
much blood loss.

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:26.458
He came back to his
senses. He survived.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:02.833
See Madam Deepa, uhh...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.417
Your husband was
deeply wounded, but...

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:11.792
now he's out of danger.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.457
Then why can't I be with him?

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:18.457
- He's on sedatives. He needs rest.
What will you do...

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:21.298
- I'll sit here the whole night,
if I'm not allowed to go in his room...

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.000
But no one can enter his room
apart from the doctor and the nurses!

00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:26.416
I won't disturb him!

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:28.749
I'll just sit in a corner...

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.917
Please help me!

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.833
I had handled two
similar cases earlier, Mr. Ajit!

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.917
Wounding someone
with porcupine quills...

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.750
Madam Deepa!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.625
Are you married,
Mr. Byomkesh?

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:55.417
Yes...!

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:59.833
Then you definitely know that,
women are way too emotional!

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:03.208
Now what if she
embraces her husband,

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:10.624
and gets emotional, then that might
turn fatal for the healing patient!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.292
No, that won't happen Doctor!

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.833
She's intelligent enough
not to do such things!

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.583
- Intelligent?
- Yes.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.250
Even I felt,
my wife is intelligent...

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:25.958
Anyway, so...

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.832
You're saying she's
sensible enough...

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.792
Uhh... yes
you can trust me!

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.958
Listen, I don't
know what to do...

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:30.667
My father and brother have
started searching for a groom for me!

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.875
Which means, no ties
with my family at all!

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.708
My grandfather will never
accept this!

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:46.792
Fine. You tell me
when to come?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.250
Where are you going???

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.208
And that too,
all alone... where?

00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:01.137
WHO ALLOWED YOU TO
STEP OUT OF THE HOUSE?!??

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:02.583
Get inside.

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:04.875
Get inside!!!

00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:07.167
I won't...

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:10.625
GET INSIDE, ELSE I'LL
CROSS MY LIMITS!!!

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:15.083
"I want to marry someone...

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.875
Hence I'm leaving this house...

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.750
Don't try to search for me.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.375
Sincerely,
Deepa."

00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:26.666
With whom are you going away?

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:27.708
And what is his name?

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.792
I'm telling both of you...

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:39.458
For our family's honour,
as soon as possible...

00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:48.708
Find a groom, and marry her off!

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:52.542
Else, we'll be doomed!

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:36.833
The first time
I saw you Deepa, I...

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.041
What happened?

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.500
I...

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.875
want to sleep separately.

00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.625
That's alright.
Sit here for a while...

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:55.042
I want to tell
you something. I...

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.542
Please, don't hesitate.

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:00.792
Come and sit...!

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:08.042
I'm sorry to say this,
but I love someone else...

00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.375
Then why did you marry me?!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.333
You could've married
the person you love!

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:25.792
He's not from my caste.

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:30.625
My family forced me to marry.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:37.750
I apologize, but believe me
I had nothing to do!

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:47.208
Will you allow me to stay here?

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.333
I'll never disturb you.

00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:12.167
Debashish!

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:14.292
Deepa's innocent!

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:17.542
She lives in her
world of fantasies!

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:21.958
Give some time,
she'll settle down...

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:25.917
I somehow don't feel so.

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:29.167
You know how women are!

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:32.250
It's her bad associations,
I tell you!

00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:35.167
But we never indulged her!

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:42.083
I can vouch for
women of our family!

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.082
Don't worry.

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:49.917
I'll handle it
sensibly. Alright?

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:55.167
Mr. Bijay!

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:59.500
I believe, Deepa's love...

00:13:00.417 --> 00:13:02.292
was indeed childish.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.875
It was temporary!

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:09.958
You all have your conversations
at Mr. Nripati's place, right?

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:11.625
Yes.

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.583
Who all are there in his family?

00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:21.417
He stays all by himself.
His wife died a few years back.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.292
Aren't you feeling
sleepy, Master?

00:13:39.042 --> 00:13:44.083
You are young enough to start a
family life again, Master!

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:51.207
Should I prepare
a cup of Ovaltine for you?

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:54.542
No... I'll
go out...

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.625
around dawn. Keep the
door open.

00:13:57.792 --> 00:13:59.125
As you say, Master.

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.250
All set for Mr. Nripati's place
tomorrow evening?

00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:35.333
Haven't decided yet.

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:37.999
Please come, will be there!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.208
See you.

00:14:40.708 --> 00:14:41.832
- Ajit, Rakhal... let's go!

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:42.958
- Let's!

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.583
- See you soon...
- See you.

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:02.792
Deepa...

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.042
When did you arrive?

00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.000
So you woke up, Sir?

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.500
Will you have something?
Water?

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.625
I'll go get Ovaltine.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.250
How're you feeling now?

00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:43.832
He had a narrow escape...

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:46.292
But he has to stay
here for 2-3 days more.

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:49.083
Ok, so can we meet him?

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:49.917
Of course!

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:51.125
But not more than 10 minutes.

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:52.167
That's more than enough!

00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:22.207
You're here since last night,
Deepa Madam, now...

00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:24.542
you have to leave us
alone for an hour.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.167
Hello, Mr. Byomkesh!

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:29.667
Even I was telling her.

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.375
Ok. See you in
30 minutes.

00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:35.625
I'll be with him.
Don't worry.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.916
How're you feeling?

00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:44.250
Uhh...

00:16:45.292 --> 00:16:46.791
Slightly better.

00:16:46.792 --> 00:16:49.208
I'll just ask few questions.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.958
Did you go to the
lake area yesterday evening?

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:57.292
Not to wander, but yes I did go.

00:16:59.208 --> 00:17:00.208
Why?

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.292
A friend of mine had called me.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yes, brother!

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.958
Brother, can you lend
me a thousand rupees?

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:21.875
I have an emergency.
I'll return the whole amount next month.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.333
Why didn't you tell
this over the phone?

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:30.167
I would have brought it. I'm not
carrying this amount right now, but...

00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:34.666
I'll hand you over at brother
Nripati's place the next day.

00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:35.667
Alright?

00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:36.792
Ok brother...

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:37.625
See you...

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:38.625
So you'll go right?

00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:42.125
I'll spend some time here...

00:17:42.208 --> 00:17:42.875
As you wish.

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:43.583
Go safely.

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:44.583
I'll...

00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:53.375
Did you see anyone behind?

00:17:55.417 --> 00:17:56.417
No...

00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:02.292
I hope your wife knows,
that your heart is on the right side.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.500
Maybe... she
doesn't.

00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:10.916
She doesn't?

00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:11.917
No.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:14.250
And your friends?

00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:18.792
I don't have many friends,
but...

00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:21.624
I have colleagues.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.625
Do they know?

00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:26.208
No.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.708
Someone from your circle
at Mr. Nripati's place?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.792
No, Mr. Byomkesh.

00:18:34.542 --> 00:18:36.082
No one knows?

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:37.167
No...

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.625
No, my father and doctor knows.

00:18:47.917 --> 00:18:50.542
Is there anyone,
who wants you to die?

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.250
No...

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.917
Mr. Byomkesh!

00:19:07.583 --> 00:19:09.792
Is this an act of insanity?

00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:15.624
Either that person is mad, or...

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:17.333
acting as a mad person!

00:19:17.583 --> 00:19:18.750
How come?

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.917
For example, you...

00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:28.292
portray so many personas
on screen and mesmerize us!

00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:32.624
Likewise, acting insane will help the
person escape punishment!

00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:34.250
Asylum can be
his place, at the most!

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.125
He won't be hanged!

00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:39.583
You all are friends
of Mr. Debashish...

00:19:40.042 --> 00:19:42.958
And must be knowing
a lot of things about his life.

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:46.500
We don't know him
for a long time...

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:51.375
Except Prabal.

00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:53.833
He was Debashish's classmate.

00:19:54.417 --> 00:19:57.208
But we were not friends.

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.875
It's just like...

00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:05.457
Major chord...

00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:07.500
and Minor chord...

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.208
Just a slight difference...

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:13.042
Not really a friend, yet...

00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:14.833
an aquaintance.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.625
We weren't enemies either!

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:20.208
He went to Delhi after school...

00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:23.583
We hardly met after that.

00:20:24.292 --> 00:20:26.667
Then, 2 months back...

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.708
we met, here.

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.707
Yesterday,
around 8 P.M.,

00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:32.583
did you ring up
Mr. Debashish?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.749
Yes... from here
only.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.792
Had used brother Nripati's
telephone.

00:20:39.708 --> 00:20:42.500
We use it whenever needed.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.167
We all were
together yesterday...

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:48.750
except Debashish.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.958
That's why I rang him up.

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:53.542
Fine.

00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.916
So after returning
from your meeting with him,

00:20:56.917 --> 00:20:59.625
did you see anyone in that area?

00:21:00.542 --> 00:21:02.499
No...

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.167
You didn't...

00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:03.583
No.

00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:05.208
By the way,
Mr. Bijay,

00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:08.833
Your sister's belongings,
from her spinster days...

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:11.042
must be here?

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.917
Hmm, but why did you ask?

00:21:15.792 --> 00:21:23.208
I'm just being the truth-seeker!

00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:26.958
How far did Madam Deepa study?

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.291
She completed her schooling...

00:21:29.292 --> 00:21:31.166
But wasn't admitted in
college...

00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:32.167
I see.

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:35.082
Would you like some tea?

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:36.125
Why not!

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:38.249
What say Rakhal, Ajit?

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.292
Yes yes!

00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:41.749
Put more sugar
in my cup, please.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.916
I'm arranging for tea...

00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:43.917
Fine..fine...

00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:55.082
Goodness!

00:21:55.083 --> 00:21:55.417
Huhh?

00:21:55.418 --> 00:21:59.500
Not a single literary
work in the house!

00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:01.291
Such a typical
orthodox family, imagine!

00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:02.292
Brother Byomkesh!

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:08.417
Let me see!

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.061
What did you find
in the copy, Byomkesh?

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.708
It's an autograph copy...

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:29.583
and there're excerpts
from a poem written here...

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.958
"Byomkesh starts reading
the lines."

00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:40.167
The rest are...
blank pages.

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:49.542
"Repeats the poetic
lines."

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:57.625
Who wrote this poem?

00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:02.042
Someone from Mr. Nripati's
chat group.

00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:03.958
- Let me see...
- No!

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.417
The road to the truth
is quite risky, Ajit...

00:23:08.083 --> 00:23:12.500
Who knows which alleys
might lead to it!

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.916
Satya, you..
And here?

00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:30.125
Weren't you unwell???

00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:35.708
Uhh... yes! (Coughs)..
I mean...

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.542
I'm better today...

00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:43.499
I was too unwell
till yesterday...

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.124
The weakness is still there...

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.125
you see...

00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:51.291
Feeling uneasy...

00:23:51.292 --> 00:23:53.417
But you didn't
inform before coming?

00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:56.166
Is that a problem?

00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:57.542
Not at all!

00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:02.125
It's your house!
Ajit...

00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:03.958
Ajit!

00:24:03.959 --> 00:24:05.125
- Yes!
- Let's go.

00:24:05.292 --> 00:24:05.500
Yes!

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.500
Uhh..Satya...

00:24:07.292 --> 00:24:09.792
We've have appointment
with the doctor.

00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:13.000
You must be tired.
Take a rest. Ok?

00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:18.875
H-how are you...

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:24.708
Byom... Byomkesh!!!

00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.125
God!

00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:33.916
We have to hide everything
from Satya,

00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:35.083
till the case solves!

00:24:35.458 --> 00:24:36.738
How will you
face her after that?

00:24:38.792 --> 00:24:40.457
I will be able to!

00:24:40.458 --> 00:24:41.458
How?

00:24:43.417 --> 00:24:45.792
If only you were also married!

00:24:48.292 --> 00:24:49.292
I got it!

00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:53.208
So, what next?

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:56.707
A trap to set...

00:24:56.708 --> 00:24:57.708
However...

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.792
Now what?

00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:06.542
The regular chat group of
Nripati Laha...

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.167
Do you know everyone?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.542
They all are my
brother's friends.

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:16.125
They often visit
your paternal house!

00:25:16.958 --> 00:25:18.792
Only if there's some work!

00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:22.625
Do you know
Mr. Nripati is a widower?

00:25:23.542 --> 00:25:25.083
Most probably...

00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:29.000
Who's married amongst
them, do you know?

00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:32.208
No.

00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:35.000
Probably...
no one is.

00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.417
And Prabal Gupta?

00:25:39.167 --> 00:25:40.167
Probably not.

00:25:40.292 --> 00:25:41.292
He is.

00:25:42.042 --> 00:25:44.208
He lost wife recently.

00:25:47.083 --> 00:25:48.457
Didn't know that...

00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.917
How is Kapil Basu as a person?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500
Not bad...

00:25:51.625 --> 00:25:53.750
Did you hear any
rumors about him?

00:25:54.292 --> 00:25:55.292
No...

00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:58.458
Do you like Sujan Kumar's
acting?

00:25:59.083 --> 00:26:00.582
Quite like it...

00:26:00.583 --> 00:26:01.833
How is he as a person?

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.417
Might be good, given he is
my brother's friend!

00:26:04.583 --> 00:26:07.625
And, have you watched
Kharag Bahadur's games?

00:26:08.542 --> 00:26:09.542
I haven't.

00:26:10.042 --> 00:26:11.874
But have heard those
commentaries on radio.

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:12.999
Fine.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.625
Now, my last question.

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.292
On which side is your
husband's heart located?

00:26:20.042 --> 00:26:20.833
Right...

00:26:20.834 --> 00:26:21.917
What?!

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.167
You know this!

00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:28.125
Yes I do.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And how?

00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:38.917
It's strange!

00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:44.250
While checking his heartbeat,
I found...

00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:47.833
Your husband's heart
is on the right side!

00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:50.750
Miraculous!

00:26:57.292 --> 00:26:58.416
I have no more questions.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:00.333
You may go back to your husband.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.750
Thank you.

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:43.332
About these porcupine quills...

00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:45.167
I have created a theory.

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.333
Suppose,

00:27:50.042 --> 00:27:55.125
I'm an unknown, insane person...

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:57.708
a 'mad' person...

00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:03.249
And I am...

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.250
a murderer!

00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:08.000
For no reason at all!

00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:10.832
For no profit at all!

00:28:10.833 --> 00:28:12.042
I'M IRRATIONAL!

00:28:12.292 --> 00:28:13.792
Without reasons!

00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:20.042
I love, to murder people!

00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:25.375
I'm the priest of Death!

00:28:25.458 --> 00:28:27.707
And I murder with the...

00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:29.292
porcupine quills!

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:31.958
I...

00:28:31.959 --> 00:28:34.166
tried to search, but I...

00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:34.417
couldn't find.

00:28:34.418 --> 00:28:35.874
For now, consider this...

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:37.249
as porcupine quill.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.708
Anyway!

00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:40.749
On the pretext of
casual walks...

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.167
I explore the city.

00:28:50.167 --> 00:28:53.208
I see a beggar on the street...

00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:55.666
The beggar life...

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:56.999
snatched by me!

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.417
Trsut me, I murder
for no reasons!

00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:06.250
Then a day, just
like the other days...

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.458
I see, this time a labourer!

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:14.125
I have no secret intentions.

00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:20.625
To murder, is in my nature!

00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:27.875
Then a shopkeeper!

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.417
I have nothing to gain...

00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:35.333
I'm... irrational!

00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:37.000
I'm... unreasonable!

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.417
I love to murder people!

00:29:42.292 --> 00:29:43.874
Who is it?

00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:48.375
No matter who is it...

00:29:49.542 --> 00:29:51.708
I murder!

00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:59.291
Why are you sad?

00:29:59.292 --> 00:30:00.917
Why... a
sad face?

00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:04.875
I'll end all your worries...

00:30:05.417 --> 00:30:11.667
I'm irrational...
I don't need any motif!

00:30:41.917 --> 00:30:42.917
See...

00:30:47.708 --> 00:30:50.208
Every time the weapon
was a porcupine quill.

00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:53.417
The murderer wants to say...

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.917
that it was executed
by one man every time.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.542
Now the question is...

00:31:00.208 --> 00:31:01.542
Who's the murderer?

00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:06.624
According to you,
he's amongst us?

00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.208
Well... might be!

00:31:09.917 --> 00:31:10.917
For example,

00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:16.542
it can be you!

00:31:17.833 --> 00:31:19.250
Then suppose...

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:22.000
What if it's Kapil?

00:31:22.542 --> 00:31:23.542
Again...

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.583
It might be...
Sujan Kumar!

00:31:30.583 --> 00:31:31.792
Kharag Bahadur!

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:34.417
It can be you also!

00:31:34.958 --> 00:31:36.167
Even...

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.917
It might be,
Mr. Prabal!

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:46.125
Mr. Bijay!

00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:49.625
It could be you even!

00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:51.417
Again...

00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:52.417
Again???

00:31:54.375 --> 00:32:00.750
It might be an unknown,
insane person as well!

00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:04.458
Imagine, Mr. Debashish has
a secret enemy...

00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:08.750
Who wants to murder him.

00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:12.291
But if he murders
Mr. Debashish first,

00:32:12.292 --> 00:32:14.625
he's afraid he might get caught!

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:19.207
So after a beggar, a laborer
and a shopkeeper...

00:32:19.208 --> 00:32:21.250
He was the fourth target.

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:27.458
He might appear a psychopath...

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.749
But his only target
was Mr. Debashish...

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.708
rest is just
his 'acting' as a psychopath.

00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:37.208
No one can imagine this!

00:32:37.792 --> 00:32:40.500
What if, another
murder happens after this?

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:43.667
With this porcupine quill?!

00:32:44.375 --> 00:32:46.250
Then what will you say?

00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:49.250
Will it make Debashish
the only target?

00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:52.625
Where will your theory go then?

00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:13.000
Then... another road
to be explored...

00:33:29.667 --> 00:33:31.167
Byomkesh Bakshi!

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.833
Yes!

00:33:34.792 --> 00:33:36.417
Fine... I'll
come alone!

00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:37.875
Fine...

00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:41.542
It worked!

00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:44.417
Didn't expect so early!

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.750
- Come Ajit!
- Let's go!

00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:18.750
I knew him since a long time...

00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:21.292
Do you have a cigarrette?

00:34:33.542 --> 00:34:39.375
It doesn't work... everytime!

00:34:40.083 --> 00:34:45.458
"The poetic lines were
written by Prabal Gupta."

00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:54.374
I knew you would do this...

00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.583
to prove Debashish
isn't the only target!

00:34:56.667 --> 00:34:57.542
You'll murder me,

00:34:57.543 --> 00:34:59.708
and your intentions
will be served as well, right?

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:02.458
What rubbish!

00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:05.374
The beggar was murdered,

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.875
on Deepa's wedding night...

00:35:07.667 --> 00:35:09.292
Coincidence... isn't it???

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.083
Nonsense!

00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.999
Keeping your married life
a secret...

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.707
you tried to woo Deepa...

00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:19.292
with your Music!

00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:21.917
Then, you try to
kill her husband!

00:35:22.583 --> 00:35:25.417
Artistry, with such
a filthy mind!

00:35:42.667 --> 00:35:45.874
Never ever play the piano
with this hand...

00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:47.542
and belittle the art of Music.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.250
Rakhal!

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:03.082
A musician like Prabal Gupta
could do this!

00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:04.250
Can't believe...

00:36:06.417 --> 00:36:07.083
Satya...

00:36:07.084 --> 00:36:09.125
Freud once said...

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:12.250
To read an artiste's mind...

00:36:12.958 --> 00:36:15.167
isn't a joke for even
the pyschiatrists!

00:36:15.208 --> 00:36:16.042
But,

00:36:16.043 --> 00:36:18.749
how could you be
so sure about...

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.291
Mr. Debashish being
the only target?

00:36:20.292 --> 00:36:23.207
From a beggar,
to an industrialist..

00:36:23.208 --> 00:36:25.000
Isn't this calculation enough?

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:29.416
And Debashish knew only...

00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:32.500
the chat group at
Mr. Nripati's place.

00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:15.958
I casually investigated
the others.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.500
Nripati has a mistress...

00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:22.667
Sujan Mitra is a doomed lover...

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.051
His girlfriend was married off
somewhere else.

00:37:25.292 --> 00:37:29.125
No women issues in
Kharag Bahadur and Kapil's life...

00:37:29.792 --> 00:37:31.042
Kharag is a gambler...

00:37:31.542 --> 00:37:35.750
And Kapil isn't into
such matters!

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.458
You know what Satya...

00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:42.082
People who are born poor,

00:37:42.083 --> 00:37:43.958
aren't ashamed of their status!

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:48.542
But people who become
poor due to situations...

00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:52.083
they, are in constant pain...

00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:53.999
Artiste Prabal Gupta belongs...

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.125
to the second category!

00:37:58.917 --> 00:38:00.000
It's like that.

00:38:04.958 --> 00:38:07.082
After his father's death...

00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:09.458
Prabal faced extreme
financial crisis...

00:38:10.417 --> 00:38:12.999
All this...

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.292
made him a greedy person.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.083
He earned fair by singing...

00:38:19.917 --> 00:38:22.500
But he wasn't contented.

00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:26.249
Moreover, marrying an ailing woman...

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.625
turned his life dreadful.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.957
Prabal had plans to woo Deepa,

00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:34.917
before his wife's death!

00:38:38.583 --> 00:38:39.666
He knew...

00:38:39.667 --> 00:38:45.749
If he could convince
Deepa to elope...

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.500
her family would
later accept it!

00:38:50.542 --> 00:38:53.166
He would acquire quite a fortune...

00:38:53.167 --> 00:38:54.708
by marrying Deepa!

00:38:58.458 --> 00:39:00.500
Deepa got caught,
while trying to escape...

00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:04.833
and was hence married off
to Debashish.

00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:07.542
As a result,

00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:20.374
He planned to
get back Deepa and her wealth.

00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:22.957
He knew Debashish
had no one except Deepa,

00:39:22.958 --> 00:39:25.624
But murdering him
at first, would have...

00:39:25.625 --> 00:39:28.250
made Prabal the prime suspect!

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:40.042
As a result, three
innocent people lost their lives.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:56.875
Deepa knew nothing
about Prabal's intentions.

00:40:01.042 --> 00:40:06.083
Woman psychology!

00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:07.333
Oh really!

00:40:07.334 --> 00:40:09.208
I didn't mean you Satya!

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.666
Listen, Deepa is innocent!

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:13.624
She's a simple girl...

00:40:13.625 --> 00:40:16.041
caged by her own people.

00:40:16.042 --> 00:40:18.832
- She didn't want that!
- You are never wrong!

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.166
Even you lied to me!

00:40:21.167 --> 00:40:22.375
There we go again!

00:40:22.958 --> 00:40:24.707
The telephone's not working...

00:40:24.708 --> 00:40:26.291
No news about you...

00:40:26.292 --> 00:40:28.166
I was worried!

00:40:28.167 --> 00:40:29.624
That's why I went to you!

00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:33.167
I completely understand Satya!

00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:36.417
But understand my condition!

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:39.500
Such an interesting case...

00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:41.957
That's why I couldn't
attend the wedding!

00:40:41.958 --> 00:40:42.750
- Engagement!

00:40:42.751 --> 00:40:47.500
Right... I couldn't leave the
case for that you see...

00:40:48.167 --> 00:40:54.333
We'll go for the wedding
together, promise!

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:58.958
Satya, I made a mistake...

00:41:03.792 --> 00:41:05.000
I didn't?!

00:41:08.167 --> 00:41:11.125
You just did, what
you wanted to.

00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:14.125
You saved a newly
wedded couple's marriage.

00:41:14.667 --> 00:41:16.541
And I'm happy.

00:41:16.542 --> 00:41:18.832
- And your death certificate,
Byomkesh?

00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:19.833
- Not needed!

00:41:20.083 --> 00:41:23.082
I'm alive and, kicking!

00:41:23.083 --> 00:41:26.000
Great! By the way,
Mr. Debashish is here!

00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:27.957
Coming brother-in-law!

00:41:27.958 --> 00:41:29.207
Narrow escape!

00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:32.125
Next time, you lie...

00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:35.292
Am I mad or what?

00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:39.333
Nothing but Satya
(Truth) form now!

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.708
Let me...
just once...

00:42:07.208 --> 00:42:09.458
God!

00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:14.541
The way Byomkesh asked Prabal...

00:42:14.542 --> 00:42:18.583
- So you have finally
recovered Mr. Debashish!

00:42:19.417 --> 00:42:21.916
Good to see you!
Please take a seat!

00:42:21.917 --> 00:42:25.125
I have many places
to go actually...

00:42:25.458 --> 00:42:30.582
Next Sunday evening, you all
are invited to my place!

00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:33.416
That's great, but...

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:34.791
Your glasses...

00:42:34.792 --> 00:42:36.625
Oh... nothing...

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:37.500
Huhh?

00:42:37.501 --> 00:42:40.542
Err..why the invitation?

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.750
I can share with
you the reason...

00:42:45.292 --> 00:42:48.833
It's my... actual
wedding reception that day...

00:42:50.292 --> 00:42:50.875
That's why...

00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:52.917
Ohh..that's why!

00:42:56.458 --> 00:42:57.624
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:42:57.625 --> 00:42:59.708
You must be his wife.

00:42:59.875 --> 00:43:00.875
Yes...

00:43:01.667 --> 00:43:04.625
You're lucky to have
such a husband!

00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:06.417
You're so right!

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.208
Huh?

00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:08.292
You can say that again!

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.082
We all will go!

00:43:13.083 --> 00:43:14.792
Please be seated...

00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:16.832
Ask Putiram to make some tea!

00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:18.124
Some snacks with it...

00:43:18.125 --> 00:43:19.249
Yes he came for the first time!

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.499
Yes, please be seated...

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.083
Some munchies!

00:43:21.084 --> 00:43:23.042
Cigarrette?

00:43:23.375 --> 00:43:24.625
So...

00:43:24.875 --> 00:43:27.708
Have you read
Ajit's writings ever?

00:43:27.875 --> 00:43:30.750
How will I earn my living,
if you all don't read my works?

00:43:31.083 --> 00:43:32.458
Mine can't be made into films!
