WEBVTT

00:04:01.277 --> 00:04:02.444
Kakababu...

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:03.961
Look!

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920
He seems injured...

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.896
He has been gutted from inside.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.795
Wh-what is happening?
Do you have any idea?

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.937
I think there's been a landslide
somewhere, that's why...

00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:16.753
Selenarctos thibetanus.

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:18.128
What toss?

00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:20.878
Selenarctos thibetanus.

00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:21.813
Run! Run!

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:25.086
Also known as Ursus thibetanus thibetanus.

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:29.062
I can't understand what you are saying. There's
been a landslide. People are running away...

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:30.086
Latin.

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:36.253
The literal translation
is Asiatic Black Bear.

00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:38.128
Bear?

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:40.211
Yes, fool. Look!

00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:42.086
No sign of landslide there.

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:45.928
There must be a bear on the prowl.
That's why everyone is running away.

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.461
- Okay. Then let's get out of here...
- No, no, no...

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.003
We will continue on our path.

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:54.961
We have to return to the hotel.
Haven't finished packing yet.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.812
It's not Bombay or Delhi that there
will be a flight every half an hour.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:00.146
This is Thyanboche...
Where eagles dare...

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.586
But Kakababu, it's a wild bear... ferocious...
you saw what it has done to the other guy...

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:07.062
Yes, but he didn't have this.

00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:09.878
Anywhere I go, this is
a bare necessity and...

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.295
If this with me, then the
possibilty of a bear hug is quite low.

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:14.836
Haha... Come on...

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:17.367
- Kakababu, it's a wild bear...
- Don't worry. Let's go...

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:19.795
- Wild bear, Kakababu...
- Come...

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.961
Whose motto is only winning
Whose only weapon is his incredible brain

00:05:54.086 --> 00:06:00.336
So many obstacles and attacks along the way
Were smashed with just a crutch

00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:13.229
Whose motto is only winning
Whose only weapon is his incredible brain

00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:20.170
So many obstacles and attacks along the way
Were smashed with just a crutch

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:33.295
Wars across the horizon are yet to be won
Raja is taking the field thereby

00:06:38.503 --> 00:06:46.503
Wars across the horizon are yet to be won
Raja is taking the field thereby

00:06:55.628 --> 00:07:02.062
Never afraid of falling, fighting or even
dying Just like the rustling of gusty wind

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:08.878
Will see the end of everything whatever that
costs The sole reason of all his adventures

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:18.295
Never afraid of falling, fighting or even
dying Just like the rustling of gusty wind

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:25.128
Will see the end of everything whatever that
costs The sole reason of all his adventures

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.545
- Kakababu... Kakababu...
- Hmmm...

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:06.086
Where did this tooth come from?
Why are we carrying it? Please, tell me.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.003
I'll tell you later.

00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:12.753
You should curb your appetite now.
You've had enough adventure, haven't you?

00:11:13.836 --> 00:11:17.003
No, no. Its not that.
When you first told me...

00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:20.170
Hey... do you want to go to Mt. Everest?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.211
Huh?!? Where?!? What?!?

00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:28.961
You were a fish out of water
at the mention of Mt. Everest... hahaha...

00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:32.545
What are you saying? Of course, I
am surprised. This is not Tiger Hills.

00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:36.503
Mt. Everest, Kakababu!
It's the highest peak in the world!

00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.795
29,028 feet high! Unbelievable!

00:11:41.378 --> 00:11:46.086
Believable... But it will be
wrong to do so. 29,035 feet.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.795
I had told you before also that the Himalayas
grow two and a half inches every year.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:56.503
Just like "Complan Boy". Its time you
went beyond your school's textbooks.

00:11:57.753 --> 00:12:03.128
Hmmm... that I will do. But where are
we starting our climb from? Nepal or India?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.470
I didn't say we will climb.
I said we will go.

00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:07.378
Oh no... We won't climb?

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.795
We will climb if we have to.
Let's see...

00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:17.045
Okay, now tell me what's common
between wireless and Mt. Everest?

00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.461
What?

00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:24.253
Jagadish Bose discovered wireless.
But the credit was given to Marconi.

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:29.229
And in a similar way, Radhanath Sikdar
was the one who discovered the peak, but...

00:12:29.253 --> 00:12:34.170
His boss at the Geological Survey of India,
Sir Everest, became immortal...

00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:37.878
You know, we have a
strange colonial hangover.

00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:41.586
Science, literature...
whatever discipline it might be...

00:12:42.003 --> 00:12:46.336
If it's a new thought or achievement,
it has to be foreign.

00:12:47.878 --> 00:12:51.086
So, you are telling me, our new adventure
is on Mt. Sikdar.

00:12:54.753 --> 00:13:02.753
Wars across the horizon are yet to be won
Raja is taking the field thereby

00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:15.961
Wars across the horizon are yet to be won
Raja is taking the field thereby

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:31.646
Never afraid of falling, fighting or even
dying Just like the rustling of gusty wind

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:38.086
Will see the end of everything whatever that
costs The sole reason of all his adventures

00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:47.503
Never afraid of falling, fighting or even
dying Just like the rustling of gusty wind

00:13:47.545 --> 00:13:54.336

00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:43.503
Wars across the horizon are yet to be won
Raja is taking the field thereby

00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:28.045
Kakababu?

00:15:28.878 --> 00:15:30.278
- Is that an avalanche?
- Avalanche.

00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:32.045
Snowslide.

00:15:32.545 --> 00:15:34.461
It destroys numerous villages at one go.

00:15:34.795 --> 00:15:38.628
In fact, that's where we went day before
to meet the sherpas.

00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:41.378
Lucky break, right?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:49.187
Logic unlocks all the questions
One cannot deceive and hide from it

00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:55.461
The one who believes in black and white
Can finish every sin all by himself

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:08.812
Logic unlocks all the questions

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:28.670

Raja is taking the field thereby

00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:57.271
Never afraid of falling, fighting or even
dying Just like a rustling of gusty wind

00:16:57.295 --> 00:17:03.878
Will see the end of everything whatever that
costs The sole reason of all his adventures

00:17:07.045 --> 00:17:13.521

Will see the end of everything whatever that
costs The sole reason of all his adventures

00:18:28.795 --> 00:18:29.961
You didn't sleep?

00:18:31.045 --> 00:18:32.711
Well, I am actually still sleeping.

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:37.545
People sleepwalk and I pretend to be an
astronomer looking through my binoculars. Idiot!

00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:40.354
Its not that.
I didn't see you downstairs... That's...

00:18:40.378 --> 00:18:43.253
Stop asking stupid questions
and check if you can see anything.

00:18:55.878 --> 00:18:56.958
Nope. I don't see anything.

00:18:57.753 --> 00:18:59.503
The moonlight is making the snow glitter.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.920
- Kala Patthar where you can see Everest from... Yes...
- Yes, that side...

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:06.345
Okay, don't look straight.
Look to your right.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.378
- Right side...
- Towards the black rock...

00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:13.628
- Do you see something moving?
- Ummm, nope. There's nothing there.

00:19:17.753 --> 00:19:19.128
No. There is nothing.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.836
- What's on your mind?
- Hmmm...

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:30.045
Nothing... You go back to bed...
I will come down in a bit...

00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:40.211
Good Morning! Open the door.

00:19:58.003 --> 00:19:59.628
- Morning, Santu!
- Good morning!

00:20:00.503 --> 00:20:01.503
Morning, Uncle!

00:20:02.378 --> 00:20:03.670
Good morning, Mingma!

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:05.461
Coffee?

00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:18.045
Uncle... Santu...

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.170
Thank you!

00:20:20.295 --> 00:20:22.586
- Pour some for yourself also.
- I've already had, Uncle.

00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:25.211
Mingma, how is the weather today?

00:20:26.545 --> 00:20:29.128
The weather is fantastic, Uncle!

00:20:29.253 --> 00:20:33.211
The sky is clear. There's not much wind.
Perfect day to move ahead.

00:20:33.628 --> 00:20:36.420
Then, should we make a move?
I'll ask everyone to pack up the camp.

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:38.586
No, Mingma.

00:20:39.628 --> 00:20:42.378
We'll have to stay here
for a few more days.

00:20:45.628 --> 00:20:47.086
As you wish, Uncle.

00:20:56.795 --> 00:20:58.295
I'll go out for a bit.

00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:00.461
Go.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.211
Hey, why are you so angry?
Let's go for a walk.

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:42.503
- Do you know Sherpas?
- What do you mean?

00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:45.420
My friend, Sherpas are brave people.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.836
We do courageous things.
We do not care about danger.

00:21:50.795 --> 00:21:55.586
We can go for days without food.
We can walk miles without stopping.

00:21:56.128 --> 00:22:01.711
But camping here at the same place
for days is okay for tourists like you...

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:03.104
But its not okay for Sherpas like us.

00:22:03.128 --> 00:22:04.586
I can understand.

00:22:05.003 --> 00:22:08.003
But don't worry.
I'm sure Kakababu has a plan.

00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:09.628
What plan are you talking about, Santu?

00:22:09.836 --> 00:22:12.378
We've been camping
here for the last 15 days.

00:22:13.295 --> 00:22:16.056
Are we going to scale mountains
or should we just continue our picnic?

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:18.295
Okay, listen to what I have to say.

00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:21.670
You tell Uncle that we
have to leave this place.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.720
Uncle will not be able
to because of his leg.

00:22:23.961 --> 00:22:26.170
We can ask him to wait at the dome.

00:22:26.503 --> 00:22:31.003
Get it? And we can take South Col
to climb Chomolungma.

00:22:31.253 --> 00:22:33.062
What? Where?

00:22:33.086 --> 00:22:34.836
What you guys call the Everest.

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:40.295
Chomolungma... Fascinating!

00:23:27.045 --> 00:23:30.295
What's this, Norbu?

00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:39.920
- Tijuti.
- Tijuti? What's that?

00:23:44.003 --> 00:23:46.170
Fool!

00:23:51.586 --> 00:23:53.128
Whatever!

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.086
Mingma! Oh, Mingma!
Wait, wait, wait.

00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:13.128
What's Tijuti?

00:24:13.878 --> 00:24:15.253
Tijuti?

00:24:16.711 --> 00:24:19.170
Tijuti is a little smaller than you.

00:24:19.211 --> 00:24:20.920
What do you mean?

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:27.146
See. Tijuti is a little smaller than you.
Miti is a little bigger than you.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.170
The fully grown, biggest
of them all, is a Yeti.

00:24:32.336 --> 00:24:35.170
Yeti? Have you ever seen one?

00:24:35.253 --> 00:24:37.437
No! I have never seen.

00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:39.354
But I have heard a lot about it
from my grandfather and his father...

00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:41.128
I don't know if they have seen or not.

00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:43.812
But there's an old man in the village
who has seen one for sure.

00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:46.479
It is furry like a bear...

00:24:46.503 --> 00:24:48.354
It has long limbs like a monkey...

00:24:48.378 --> 00:24:50.753
It has big eyes and huge teeth...

00:24:54.628 --> 00:24:55.795
What?

00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:26.503
We've not come here to scale the Everest.

00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:28.545
We've come to look for the yeti, right?

00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:32.545
Wow! Junior Archimedes!

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.961
Your very own "Eureka! Eureka!" moment.

00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:37.503
It's a good thing you are
wearing some clothes.

00:25:38.086 --> 00:25:41.336
Come on, Kakababu!
Tell me, to what does that tooth belong?

00:25:41.628 --> 00:25:43.045
It belongs to a yeti, right?

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.961
It's the teeth, which is our identity...

00:25:51.128 --> 00:25:53.961
The time has come to unravel history...

00:25:55.961 --> 00:26:00.211
Then listen to this story...

00:26:44.378 --> 00:26:47.170
Those three teeth that were
scattered with the plate...

00:26:47.586 --> 00:26:49.961
Only two were ever found...

00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:56.271
Later, Professor Koeningswald gave one
tooth to his best friend, Michael Shipton.

00:26:56.295 --> 00:27:00.562
And he had donated the other one
to New York's Museum of Natural History.

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:03.920
- And the third one is with you.
- Smart!

00:27:04.461 --> 00:27:08.687
And I got it from a famous anthropologist
called Sir Arthur Rockbottom.

00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:14.128
And he had bought it
from an attendant at the club.

00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:30.795
So, this tooth really belongs to a yeti?

00:27:31.878 --> 00:27:36.711
- Put it down.
- Yes, I'm sorry...

00:27:41.211 --> 00:27:45.420
There is still some
mystery about it, Santu...

00:27:47.003 --> 00:27:55.003
According to Rockbottom, the carbon dating of this
tooth reveals its age to be around 150 to 200 years old.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.562
And it belongs to a gigantic half-ape,
half-human creature.

00:27:59.586 --> 00:28:02.812
Almost like Ghatotkach
from the Mahabharata.

00:28:02.836 --> 00:28:08.670
On the other hand, the yeti has never been described
to be such a huge creature in the local folklores.

00:28:08.836 --> 00:28:11.854
At the most, it is like Hagrid
from the Harry Potter novels...

00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:14.562
A hybrid between a bear
and a monkey may be...

00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:21.586
But yes, the feet are like human
and the size is that of an elephant.

00:28:21.628 --> 00:28:25.711
But instead of five
fingers, it has only four.

00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:30.836
Hmmm, understood.
But why exactly have we come here?

00:28:31.253 --> 00:28:34.711
And what do you keep looking for
with your binoculars at night?

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.211
The last piece jigsaw piece.

00:28:40.336 --> 00:28:43.253
- You remember Michael Shipton?
- Hmmm...

00:28:43.503 --> 00:28:45.646
He had a son, Caine Shipton.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.211
Famous explorer...

00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:50.646
He got the tooth from his father.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.729
And considered it to be very lucky
and wore it around his neck.

00:28:54.753 --> 00:28:59.336
Round three years back he had come here
for an Everest expedition.

00:28:59.378 --> 00:29:03.229
But poor guy never made it back home.
And his body was also not found.

00:29:03.253 --> 00:29:07.354
Caine Shipton just disappeared
under very mysterious circumstances.

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:10.336
- And the most interesting thing?
- What?

00:29:10.378 --> 00:29:12.670
He used to stay in this very dome.

00:29:12.753 --> 00:29:15.878
And stared out of that window
with his binoculars at night.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:22.503
And he maintained this diary.

00:29:44.503 --> 00:29:48.670
- It has completely stopped raining.
- Yes, the sky is very clear.

00:29:49.045 --> 00:29:52.961
Where's Mingma?
Mingma. Mingma!

00:29:54.128 --> 00:29:55.771
- Yes, Uncle!
- There he is...

00:29:55.795 --> 00:29:56.920
Come here.

00:30:00.961 --> 00:30:05.378
- It has stopped raining.
- Yes! Let's pack up the camp then?

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.920
No. We will have to stay here
for a few more days.

00:30:10.003 --> 00:30:14.545
Let's go towards the Kala Pathhar.
Got it?

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.229
What is the sky telling you?
Will we get a glimpse of the Everest?

00:30:19.253 --> 00:30:22.295
Yes, Uncle! Of course,
we will be able to see it.

00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:26.711
- But do we have to stay here for longer?
- Yes, we will have to.

00:30:28.045 --> 00:30:30.336
Come, let's go for a walk. Come.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.170
- Mingma?
- Yes, Uncle.

00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:36.461
Have you heard of Caine Shipton?

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.586
He had come here
on an expedition two years back.

00:30:40.128 --> 00:30:43.187
Yes, Uncle.
But I didn't come.

00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:45.062
My friend, Tsering,
had accompanied him.

00:30:45.086 --> 00:30:49.920
I've heard Mr. Shipton was a jolly fellow.
He had a great sense of humour.

00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:51.812
He was in great shape too.

00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:54.586
Everyone was certain,
he'll be able to climb Mt. Everest.

00:30:54.836 --> 00:30:57.104
But he died because
he didn't listen to anyone.

00:30:57.128 --> 00:30:58.646
What do you mean?

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.104
There are some principles
and rules in these mountains.

00:31:02.128 --> 00:31:06.396
Don't go anywhere alone.
Always take your Sherpa along.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.229
Mr. Shipton was somewhat of a daredevil.
He didn't listen to anyone.

00:31:10.253 --> 00:31:13.354
He went out for a walk alone
and got lost in the snow.

00:31:13.378 --> 00:31:17.062
- In a crevasse like this?
- It's quite possible.

00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:21.479
There are crevasses, cracks,
fissures, rockfalls...

00:31:21.503 --> 00:31:22.812
There are frozen rivers...

00:31:22.836 --> 00:31:25.854
There is loose snow,
avalanche, blizzard...

00:31:25.878 --> 00:31:27.396
And yeti?

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.854
- Are there any yetis?
- What?

00:31:29.878 --> 00:31:33.229
There is a strange incident
mentioned in Shipton's diary.

00:31:33.253 --> 00:31:36.687
Although it doesn't have anything to do
with his death or disappearance.

00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:38.545
But still...

00:31:40.753 --> 00:31:42.628
What is written in the diary?

00:31:43.461 --> 00:31:44.812
Why did you stop?

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.003
Nothing to be scared of.
Let's keep moving.

00:31:47.795 --> 00:31:51.003
He had written that on one of his treks...

00:31:51.086 --> 00:31:56.937
He had encountered a huge, furry creature
which was almost thrice his size...

00:31:56.961 --> 00:31:57.961
What?

00:31:58.086 --> 00:32:02.378
Yes, the strange part is the creature
disappeared before attacking him...

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:07.961
- Right in front of Shipton's eyes...
- Invisible? Meaning...

00:32:13.795 --> 00:32:20.836
One of our local myths say that yetis
can disappear after eating a special plant.

00:32:23.503 --> 00:32:29.753
I know. I read some of Shipton's entries
about the local myths.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.479
And apparently those wild plants
have very pretty colourful flowers.

00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:36.045
Yes... But can I say something, Uncle?

00:32:36.086 --> 00:32:44.045
If the coolies find out that you
have come here to look for yetis...

00:32:44.378 --> 00:32:46.354
Everyone will run away.

00:32:46.378 --> 00:32:50.920
It is true no one has seen a yeti.

00:32:51.086 --> 00:32:55.045
But everyone fears it
and worships it like a god.

00:32:55.211 --> 00:32:59.836
So, will you also run away,
my brave Sherpa, Mingma?

00:33:01.211 --> 00:33:05.128
Are you kidding me?
I will stay with you.

00:33:05.295 --> 00:33:08.146
So what?
We have no weapons.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.503
What will you fight
the yeti with? Your crutch?

00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:15.128
I have something
other than my crutch, Mingma.

00:33:18.795 --> 00:33:22.378
Oh, I get it. Your secret weapon.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.753
Okay, tell me something...

00:33:37.128 --> 00:33:40.461
Kakababu! Help!

00:33:40.628 --> 00:33:44.545
- No, its not that... Look...
- Santu!

00:33:45.003 --> 00:33:51.336
Help! Save me! Help! Help!
Ka-Kakababu!

00:33:51.378 --> 00:33:55.628
- Hold my hand...
- Help!

00:34:01.753 --> 00:34:05.920
Get up! Come on!

00:34:14.545 --> 00:34:19.586
How many times have I warned you
not to go out of our sight?!?

00:34:19.628 --> 00:34:24.586
- You never listen to me.
- But I was with you.

00:34:25.295 --> 00:34:30.545
- Suddenly... I saw...
- What did you see?

00:34:31.878 --> 00:34:33.420
What did you see?

00:34:34.003 --> 00:34:36.646
Those flowers...
Those colourful flowers...

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.687
Just like the ones mentioned
in Shipton's diary...

00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:40.562
Those? Those are crocus...

00:34:40.586 --> 00:34:42.795
Will you jump
at all colourful flowers now?

00:34:43.961 --> 00:34:49.336
I was looking at those and slipped
and fell inside.

00:34:50.461 --> 00:34:55.503
After I fell, I hit something with my foot.

00:34:56.586 --> 00:34:58.586
- And then...
- Okay, okay...

00:34:59.503 --> 00:35:02.437
Don't think we can make it to Kala Pathhar
today. Let's go back to the base camp.

00:35:02.461 --> 00:35:04.003
- Okay.
- It will be evening soon.

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:08.646
Mingma, I think we should
put up a sign here.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.937
So that no one falls
through the crevasse.

00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:15.271
Okay, Uncle.
I will get it done.

00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:18.729
Let's see if Santu has something
in his bag. Do you?

00:35:18.753 --> 00:35:19.812
- Please check.
- Yes, go and check.

00:35:19.836 --> 00:35:21.461
I'll see if I can find something.

00:35:27.253 --> 00:35:30.920
- Move these things around and see. Not that.
- Got it.

00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:34.795
- Uncle?
- Won't this do?

00:37:41.086 --> 00:37:42.711
Good morning!

00:37:46.378 --> 00:37:50.545
- Perfect time for you to wake up.
- Kakababu?

00:37:52.378 --> 00:37:55.253
I have heard that there are
rocks under the snow.

00:37:56.753 --> 00:37:58.711
But iron?

00:37:59.128 --> 00:38:03.854
It is really an ironical situation.
Now come up, quickly, or you will miss it.

00:38:03.878 --> 00:38:08.670
What? What will I miss?
Wait. Wait.

00:38:20.211 --> 00:38:25.229
From darkness, lead me to light.
From death, lead me to immortality.

00:38:25.253 --> 00:38:29.420
- What does it mean?
- Light at the end of the tunnel.

00:38:56.545 --> 00:39:00.211
- Mingma, are we ready?
- Yes, Uncle.

00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:06.646
- When should we leave for Everest?
- In another half an hour.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.647
Okay.

00:39:07.671 --> 00:39:09.878
We will reach Kala Pathhar
before evening.

00:39:10.045 --> 00:39:13.711
- How long do you plan to stay there?
- A few hours.

00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:17.354
Our first break
will be at Kala Pathhar.

00:39:17.378 --> 00:39:20.604
We will camp overnight
and leave at daybreak.

00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:23.521
Don't we have to climb
the Everest quickly?

00:39:23.545 --> 00:39:27.128
Uncle, you are weird.

00:39:27.628 --> 00:39:29.670
You have been camping
here for days...

00:39:29.795 --> 00:39:32.229
And suddenly this morning
you decided to move forward...

00:39:32.253 --> 00:39:35.920
Not only that. Now, you want to climb
the Everest quickly too...

00:39:36.378 --> 00:39:37.812
Then, why so much time here?

00:39:37.836 --> 00:39:40.146
Timing is very important
in life, Mingma.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.729
If the timing is off, nothing works out.

00:39:42.753 --> 00:39:46.503
So, how long does it take to climb
Mt. Everest from Kala Pathhar?

00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:51.086
It will take about 7-8 days.
If we take South Col...

00:39:51.378 --> 00:39:56.086
Uncle, are you really going
to climb Mt. Everest?

00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:02.979
Mingma, one doesn't
climb mountains on foot...

00:40:03.003 --> 00:40:07.128
It takes courage, confidence
and faith.

00:40:07.711 --> 00:40:10.729
Ask them to hurry up.
We'll have to leave soon.

00:40:10.753 --> 00:40:11.753
Yes, Uncle.

00:40:16.545 --> 00:40:20.753
Norbu, what are you doing?
Bring our luggage out.

00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:27.271
- What is that?
- That? That is a tooth.

00:40:27.295 --> 00:40:29.003
Please get our luggage.

00:40:31.628 --> 00:40:33.628
Whose tooth is this?

00:40:34.836 --> 00:40:38.003
Well, I don't know...
It's Kakababu's thing...

00:40:39.295 --> 00:40:42.628
Don't worry about that.
You just get our luggage. Come on.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.295
Human beings don't have such big teeth.
It must be...

00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:52.437
Put it down! Kakababu will be furious.
Put it down now!

00:40:52.461 --> 00:40:54.562
Can't you hear me?
I'm asking you to put it down.

00:40:54.586 --> 00:40:58.503
What are you doing? Why aren't you
listening to me? Put it down, now!

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.545
What happened?
What are you doing with that?

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.628
Nothing... I was just looking at it.

00:41:50.836 --> 00:41:54.253
It's beautiful, isn't it.
Can I carry it?

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.003
No! Pack it immediately.

00:42:01.545 --> 00:42:04.711
And what is Norbu doing on the floor?

00:42:05.586 --> 00:42:11.045
Oh... He slipped and fell...
Norbu, get up. Come on.

00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:14.795
I will get it done. Get up,
get up. Let's go...

00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:23.711
How can you fall like that, Norbu?
You go ahead. I will do it.

00:42:28.878 --> 00:42:30.628
Let me keep this safely, okay.

00:42:30.878 --> 00:42:35.961
In the desert, snow, rivers or mountains If the
unbearable danger increases in every footstep

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:42.420
The mystery generates under the collar With
snake-like disaster and scorpion-like danger

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:55.545
In the desert, snow, rivers or mountains If the
unbearable danger increases in every footstep

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:02.086
The mystery generates under the collar With
snake-like diasaster and scorpion-like danger

00:43:07.795 --> 00:43:15.795
Wars across the horizon are yet to be won
Raja is taking the field thereby

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:47.979
What happened? Are you feeling tired?
Should I ask them to stop?

00:43:48.003 --> 00:43:48.980
No, no.

00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:53.961
Do you remember the direction
of the lights we saw from the dome?

00:43:54.003 --> 00:43:59.461
- Hmmm? Which direction?
- I really can't figure out. You tell me.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.771
Why don't you draw up a map
of any new place in your mind?

00:44:03.795 --> 00:44:06.211
Don't you recognise these rocks?

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.503
And this bend on the left?

00:44:11.253 --> 00:44:17.021
Listen, I'll have to stay here for a bit.
I'll study this place thoroughly.

00:44:17.045 --> 00:44:19.170
- Okay.
- You guys go ahead.

00:44:19.545 --> 00:44:22.146
Okay. I will ask Mingma and Norbu
to go ahead. I will stay with you.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.503
No, listen to me.
They will become suspicious.

00:44:24.545 --> 00:44:27.521
They will think we are looking for yetis
instead of climbing the Everest.

00:44:27.545 --> 00:44:31.396
You tell them that I am feeling tired
and I will catch up.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.021
Ask them to camp at Kala Pathhar.

00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:36.461
- Go on...
- But what will you do here by yourself?

00:44:37.128 --> 00:44:38.545
Case dismissed. Now, go.

00:44:42.378 --> 00:44:44.128
- Be careful...
- I said go...

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.461
Yeti!!!

00:46:00.545 --> 00:46:01.920
Where?

00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:09.795
Where? Where?
Where did you see it exactly?

00:46:10.586 --> 00:46:11.586
Don't run away. Wait!

00:46:13.711 --> 00:46:18.961
Why are you pulling me? Wait! Let me
take a photo? Kakababu will scold me...

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:51.170
Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Yeti!

00:47:53.711 --> 00:48:00.711
- Yeti! Uncle! Yeti!
- Yeti? Where?

00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:03.920
- The yeti is behind that mountain...
- Let's go...

00:48:04.003 --> 00:48:08.628
- Uncle, we have run from this place...
- Where is the yeti?

00:48:08.961 --> 00:48:11.979
It's there, by the mountain...
Santu has also seen it. Ask him.

00:48:12.003 --> 00:48:15.545
- Did you see it?
- Yes, just a glimpse...

00:48:15.795 --> 00:48:18.479
You ran back after seeing it
instead of following it?

00:48:18.503 --> 00:48:19.896
Are you an idiot?

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.295
Or are you like the intellectuals
who are limited to Facebook posts?

00:48:23.336 --> 00:48:27.295
Only fiery status updates and comments...
And you just fled?

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.187
Everyone was screaming so much...

00:48:29.211 --> 00:48:32.479
What are you saying?
We are no match for a yeti!

00:48:32.503 --> 00:48:34.795
It would have eaten us alive!
Are you crazy?

00:48:35.795 --> 00:48:39.003
Mingma! Mingma!

00:48:49.711 --> 00:48:54.312
- Uncle! We have to go back...
- Is it really a yeti's footprint? Really?

00:48:54.336 --> 00:48:56.062
No one will go further than this.

00:48:56.086 --> 00:48:59.437
Norbu said whoever looks at the yeti,
is a dead man.

00:48:59.461 --> 00:49:00.687
Everyone will die!

00:49:00.711 --> 00:49:06.211
Have you seen this revolver?
Everyone is quiet in front of this.

00:49:06.628 --> 00:49:09.378
- Come on. Let's go!
- Have you gone completely mad?

00:49:09.503 --> 00:49:15.253
- Norbu! Stop!
- Uncle, the yeti is the devil reincarnate...

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:18.628
Your bullets are not going to work on it.

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:23.878
Fine! You people dwell on your myths
and stories, Santu and I will go ahead.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.396
- Santu, let's go...
- Kakababu, please listen to them... Wait!

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.086
- Uncle, please stop... Please listen to us...
- Move aside...

00:49:35.586 --> 00:49:39.920
You have the letter from Nepal's King.
You have the support from police.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.420
You have the full support
of both the governments.

00:49:43.128 --> 00:49:45.062
They will bury us alive...

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:48.420
If they get to know
we left you alone here.

00:49:48.795 --> 00:49:51.604
Then, you decide.
Police or yeti?

00:49:51.628 --> 00:49:54.128
Although, both options are equally bad.

00:49:54.336 --> 00:49:56.628
Come, come, come.
Anyway, I'm going ahead.

00:49:58.545 --> 00:50:03.128
- Let me go.
- Wait! They are already scared...

00:50:03.503 --> 00:50:08.336
What is happening?
What are you guys doing?

00:50:09.753 --> 00:50:12.920
- Santu, ask them to put me down!
- Put him down.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:19.711
- Ask them to put me down.
- What can I do? They are not listening to me.

00:50:20.128 --> 00:50:21.479
Mingma! Put him down!

00:50:21.503 --> 00:50:23.586
It would have been better
to be abducted by a yeti!

00:50:44.628 --> 00:50:48.146
I am on a palanquin... hmmm...

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.753
Kakababu, now please stop singing!

00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:54.187
We have to figure out a solution.
These guys have gone berserk.

00:50:54.211 --> 00:50:55.211
What is your plan?

00:50:56.836 --> 00:50:58.586
Please be careful. Mingma!

00:50:58.753 --> 00:51:00.503
What is happening?
You can put him down now.

00:51:01.295 --> 00:51:03.170
What do...

00:51:11.628 --> 00:51:15.045
Thank you for carrying me so far.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.687
Now, you guys get back safely.
Write to me. Okay?

00:51:19.711 --> 00:51:22.503
Why are you being so stubborn?

00:51:22.711 --> 00:51:24.312
You won't survive 2 days on your own here.

00:51:24.336 --> 00:51:28.128
I am begging you...
Please come back with us.

00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:33.336
You have been very restless
since morning...

00:51:33.503 --> 00:51:34.878
Don't do it.

00:51:35.128 --> 00:51:38.062
Otherwise, I will make sure you are
not just unable to climb mountains...

00:51:38.086 --> 00:51:40.711
You will be unable
to use your own commode...

00:51:42.628 --> 00:51:46.670
And my dear brave Mingma...

00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:51.437
You don't have to be concerned
about our life or death anymore.

00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:55.354
Why don't you rather go back to your village
and tell your family, friends and neighbours...

00:51:55.378 --> 00:52:00.062
That a Sherpa's surname is not necessarily
Dorji, Gelu or Norgay

00:52:00.086 --> 00:52:02.729
Sometimes, it is Roychowdhury!

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:05.378
Anyway, travel safe.
Pick this up.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.920
Come on.

00:52:45.503 --> 00:52:49.461
How are you feeling?
Are you okay? Or feeling scared?

00:52:51.878 --> 00:52:53.586
No. I am okay.

00:52:55.128 --> 00:52:59.961
- What should we do about food?
- Oh, yes! I am famished.

00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:04.586
- Do we have any biscuits and cheese?
- Obviously, we do.

00:53:05.545 --> 00:53:07.836
But I am talking about other things.

00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:12.961
They left with everything.
They are the ones who cooked.

00:53:13.795 --> 00:53:16.461
This is all the food we have.
How long can we survive on this?

00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:20.503
Almost as if we were Robinson Crusoe!

00:53:20.878 --> 00:53:24.187
Robinson Crusoe? Kakababu, you are still
in the mood to joke?

00:53:24.211 --> 00:53:29.378
Why are you worrying so much?
So what we don't have food! Who cares!

00:53:29.586 --> 00:53:33.146
I tried a couple of times in the morning.
But didn't get through.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:41.128
Let me try... Let me try once again
to radio the news across to Syangboche...

00:53:41.711 --> 00:53:45.628
Then help will arrive by evening.

00:53:49.086 --> 00:53:50.795
What if the wireless doesn't work?

00:53:54.628 --> 00:53:56.378
What if they are late? Then what?

00:53:58.586 --> 00:54:03.045
What about avalanches?
What if the snow covers up the dome?

00:54:04.211 --> 00:54:06.562
And to top it all off,
there's the yeti.

00:54:06.586 --> 00:54:09.687
What will happen if a yeti comes?
Bad situation... We 're done.

00:54:09.711 --> 00:54:13.170
All of these are possibilities
but the probabilty is very low.

00:54:13.378 --> 00:54:15.670
Stop bothering yorself and take a nap.

00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:19.795
Meanwhile, I'll try and make an SOS flag
with a stick.

00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:23.461
- But we will run out of food...
- Still stuck on but...

00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:25.481
Why don't you think of something else.

00:54:25.878 --> 00:54:29.795
- So, how is Rini?
- What?

00:54:30.045 --> 00:54:34.062
Rini, the one you got lost with in
the desert? You don't remember her?

00:54:34.086 --> 00:54:38.878
Please, Kakababu...
Nothing like that happened, okay.

00:54:44.628 --> 00:54:47.253
Anyway, we broke up.

00:54:49.336 --> 00:54:51.961
What? Hope you are happy now.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:58.545
And what about your days?
Is Time standing still?

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.586
More like Time is frozen
right now...

00:55:05.961 --> 00:55:10.312
Bravo! But don't throw in
the towel so easily...

00:55:10.336 --> 00:55:14.211
Keep moving. This too shall pass.

00:55:16.295 --> 00:55:21.211
- My experience was...
- What?

00:57:06.878 --> 00:57:11.479
- Santu! Santu! Wake up! Quick!
- What happened?

00:57:11.503 --> 00:57:14.295
This is the perfect time to
think on your feet! Get up!

00:57:14.503 --> 00:57:17.354
- What happened?
- The latch on the window is broken.

00:57:17.378 --> 00:57:20.836
There is a wooden box there.
And a hammer and nails. Get them.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.003
- Come quickly!
- Yes, coming...

00:57:38.461 --> 00:57:40.420
- Come quickly, Santu!
- Yes, coming...

00:57:48.128 --> 00:57:51.003
Yes, fix it right here.

00:57:52.795 --> 00:57:57.628
Got it? Yes. Hit it harder.

00:57:58.128 --> 00:58:01.378
Okay, now this side...

00:58:05.503 --> 00:58:10.753
A storm is brewing...

00:58:11.211 --> 00:58:13.753
- Why are you singing now?
- Fix it. Fix it.

00:58:25.086 --> 00:58:30.003
Great! Now go back to sleep...
I will keep trying to make contact...

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:50.170
Who is there? This is your last warning.
I will shoot once the door opens.

00:59:51.378 --> 00:59:55.545
- No, Kakababu, wait. This could be...
- Yeti?

00:59:56.336 --> 01:00:03.003
If the yeti is a living being then it will
definitely bow down in front of the bullet.

01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:06.795
Please, Kakababu... Listen to me.
I am sure this must be...

01:00:19.795 --> 01:00:21.086
Who is it?

01:00:40.628 --> 01:00:42.086
It is not budging.

01:00:43.586 --> 01:00:48.170
Interesting. Someone scared us
and locked us in.

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:49.878
What do you mean?

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:55.586
We can't escape unless
someone opens the door.

01:00:55.628 --> 01:00:57.378
Trapped?!?

01:00:57.878 --> 01:01:01.521
Actually, I was able to connect
to the base camp in the morning...

01:01:01.545 --> 01:01:03.420
But then I lost the signal.

01:01:04.211 --> 01:01:06.646
No idea if they are
sending a rescue party.

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:10.336
And even if they do, won't get here
before 2-3 days.

01:01:10.586 --> 01:01:14.854
2-3 days? What about food?
And the cold?

01:01:14.878 --> 01:01:16.336
The cold?

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:23.354
Even if we somehow manage to survive
the fall by escaping through that window,

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:27.295
the cold outside spells certain death...

01:01:28.295 --> 01:01:33.086
Again if no air passes in through the
cracks, we will die due to lack of oxygen.

01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:41.003
Crocodile in water, tiger on land...
Get it, Mr. Santu?

01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:44.646
That's enough for now.
Go, lock the door from inside.

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.646
So that, whoever has locked us in,
can't get in.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:51.253
- Go on.
- Yes, right away.

01:02:14.461 --> 01:02:22.461
Lines of destiny crash on the hills Where a
small ship also carries the news of a storm

01:02:24.711 --> 01:02:32.711
Still you have to keep walking with a smile
Even if you have to keep floating

01:02:46.336 --> 01:02:54.336
When even the lonely Sun gets covered in the
morning The mist tells stories of tragedy

01:02:56.795 --> 01:03:04.795
Take another path but have to keep moving
Miles to go

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:25.836
Have to keep moving on a snowy night Have to
cover the days of struggle and nights of pain

01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:14.961
Tired feet are covered in avalanche
Blue wounds of hard times are here

01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:32.211
Tired feet are covered in avalanche
Blue wounds of hard times are here

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:50.420
Hot lava engulfs the Pompeii days End
of the day comes the account of struggle

01:04:52.545 --> 01:05:00.545
Still got to move taking measured steps
Have to move determined

01:05:14.336 --> 01:05:22.336
Dreams have turned into cold lifeless
stones Pain draws patterns under the feet

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:32.795
Still have to move
Have to move finding a way

01:05:46.086 --> 01:05:54.086
Have to keep moving on a snowy night Have to
cover the days of struggle and nights of pain

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.170
Anybody in there?

01:07:16.503 --> 01:07:18.211
Is anybody inside?

01:07:35.753 --> 01:07:37.003
Is anybody in there?

01:07:56.045 --> 01:07:59.711
We are breaking the
lock and opening the door.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.586
Now, open the lock from inside.

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:10.628
- Go, open the latch.
- Yes.

01:08:32.753 --> 01:08:38.878
- Is everything okay?
- Your Bengali is very good for a Verma.

01:08:39.128 --> 01:08:43.187
I've studied in Kolkata's Loreto College...
stayed in the YWCA hostel.

01:08:43.211 --> 01:08:45.354
Well, even I am also pretty good
in this regard.

01:08:45.378 --> 01:08:49.003
Darjeeling North Point.
I have many Bengali friends.

01:08:49.586 --> 01:08:54.878
That's great! Now if we can get some food...
We have been starving for the last few days...

01:08:55.711 --> 01:08:57.229
We are arranging for the food.

01:08:57.253 --> 01:08:59.378
But first tell us,
who is that man outside?

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.003
- Man?
- Yes.

01:09:47.253 --> 01:09:49.729
We've been here for the last 5 days.

01:09:49.753 --> 01:09:53.878
He was not there when we entered the dome
or when the sherpas left.

01:09:54.336 --> 01:09:59.729
From the rigor mortis it seems
he's been dead for 2 weeeks.

01:09:59.753 --> 01:10:02.045
But body has not decayed
due to the cold.

01:10:02.086 --> 01:10:04.086
So, what do we do now?

01:10:06.628 --> 01:10:12.295
We have to send the body for post mortem
to Kathmandu via Syangboche.

01:10:12.628 --> 01:10:17.420
This man looks very strange.
He is thin but unnaturally so.

01:10:17.586 --> 01:10:20.295
He looks like he died
because he was on a diet.

01:10:20.378 --> 01:10:24.021
Mr. Roychowdhury, I have a suggestion.

01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:29.503
We can all go back
in the helicopter.

01:10:40.878 --> 01:10:45.354
He is attracted to words like danger,
challenge, impossible, risky...

01:10:45.378 --> 01:10:47.670
It can be the pyramid or the Jarwa...

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.562
I think we should send the body back
in the helicopter...

01:10:51.586 --> 01:10:53.420
Let's get it back here at our disposal.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.628
Till then, let's hear Mr. Roychowdhury's
plan of action.

01:11:02.253 --> 01:11:06.420
Its just that, we have to investigate
what we have come so far for.

01:11:06.503 --> 01:11:09.295
Mr. Roychowdhury, you don't believe
in yetis, do you?

01:11:09.545 --> 01:11:10.604
And you are not scared either?

01:11:10.628 --> 01:11:16.711
No! You want to know why?
Because I deal with human beings.

01:11:17.378 --> 01:11:20.271
And no animal is more
dangerous than humans.

01:11:20.295 --> 01:11:25.312
Have you ever heard of yetis
pulling young yetis out...

01:11:25.336 --> 01:11:30.729
..of the army school and shooting them
at point blank range?

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:34.979
Anyway, if a revolver
or a 9 mmr carbine is pointed at it...

01:11:35.003 --> 01:11:37.753
Not just a yeti,
even a dragon will flee...

01:11:39.836 --> 01:11:41.128
I have seen the yeti.

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:48.628
- Behind a rock enroute Kala Pathhar.
- Exactly!

01:11:48.795 --> 01:11:52.271
So, we should go back to the place
where Santu saw the yeti.

01:11:52.295 --> 01:11:54.479
Because no matter what Santu has seen...

01:11:54.503 --> 01:12:01.312
Or whatever stories the Sherpas have been
telling their kids for ages...

01:12:01.336 --> 01:12:07.003
Or whatever Shipton had mentioned in his
diary... Someone needs to find the truth.

01:12:08.378 --> 01:12:11.670
How did Shipton
disappear or die?

01:12:12.003 --> 01:12:15.378
Did a yeti kill him?
Where was his body disposed?

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:18.711
Do yetis really eat human?
Etcetra, etcetra...

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:23.795
And we won't be able to find any answers
sitting in front of this dome.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:31.878
Anyway, we don't have much to do
till the helicopter comes back.

01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:36.003
Let's check out the spot.
We might just find some clues.

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:38.878
- Kakababu...
- Hmmm...

01:12:44.295 --> 01:12:46.461
Whoever it is, put your hands in the air!

01:12:55.628 --> 01:12:56.878
Mingma!

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.128
Mingma!!!

01:13:06.628 --> 01:13:12.128
I asked myself.
Who is brave? Who is courageous?

01:13:12.253 --> 01:13:13.937
Who is the real Sherpa?

01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:15.921
The one who has come to scale Everest
on one foot?

01:13:16.795 --> 01:13:18.461
The one who will catch the yeti?

01:13:19.378 --> 01:13:22.503
Or is it me who fled leaving them behind?

01:13:23.045 --> 01:13:28.378
Ma'am, I am a true blue Sherpa.
I won't be able to live with such shame.

01:13:28.461 --> 01:13:30.229
That's why I came back.

01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:35.670
And Uncle, if you don't take me back,
I am ready to kill myself.

01:13:35.795 --> 01:13:37.271
You do whatever you want.

01:13:37.295 --> 01:13:39.628
But first tell us,
why did you lock them in from outside?

01:13:40.586 --> 01:13:43.795
- I'm telling you, I don't know anything.
- Stop lying!

01:13:45.711 --> 01:13:48.586
The government would have punished you
for leaving them behind.

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.878
That's why you planned
to kill them.

01:13:51.045 --> 01:13:58.086
Please believe me, Sir! I know nothing.
Uncle, you too... Please believe me.

01:13:58.586 --> 01:14:00.253
Santu, please tell them.

01:14:01.378 --> 01:14:04.586
Sherpas are not like this.
Sherpas are never disloyal.

01:14:05.586 --> 01:14:08.920
Yes, I deserted them.
I was wrong.

01:14:09.295 --> 01:14:12.711
But what is this about locking the door...
I don't know, I don't know...

01:14:12.753 --> 01:14:14.003
It's okay.

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:18.330
Are you going to stay here now or are you
going to run away again from the yeti?

01:14:20.295 --> 01:14:23.420
No, Uncle. Never again.
Never ever again.

01:14:24.211 --> 01:14:29.170
You will see. I will give up my life
but I will never abandon you again.

01:14:37.295 --> 01:14:43.586
- What exactly did you see here?
- A figure. A huge body.

01:14:44.295 --> 01:14:50.170
- Almost like a monkey or a bear.
- And it disappeared when we screamed.

01:14:57.711 --> 01:14:59.003
No, no, I am fine.

01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:05.503
I've been on this route many times.

01:15:19.503 --> 01:15:21.795
No, no. It's all rubbish.

01:15:22.628 --> 01:15:25.920
Whoever I ask, "Have you seen a yeti?"
They say no.

01:15:26.295 --> 01:15:32.378
"My friend has seen." Or "My uncle has
seen." But no one has seen it themselves.

01:15:45.753 --> 01:15:49.628
But it's true. That day almost 10 of us
saw the yeti.

01:15:50.336 --> 01:15:54.753
- I am swearing on Pashupatinath. Right, Santu?
- Correct!

01:15:55.045 --> 01:15:59.795
In fact, Kakababu had even seen yeti's
footprints. It was human-like but much bigger.

01:15:59.961 --> 01:16:02.336
And instead of five,
it had only four digits.

01:16:02.378 --> 01:16:04.628
Santu, look there...

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:54.836
How will the four of us look for him?

01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:05.312
Please try and understand.

01:17:05.336 --> 01:17:08.211
I feel we are very close
to solving this mystery.

01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:12.812
Caine Shipton also disappeared from here.
He had also seen a yeti.

01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:14.312
Exactly the same way we did.

01:17:14.336 --> 01:17:17.545
And I'm pretty sure this is somehow
connected to Kakababu's disappearance.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:27.878
I had fallen into a crevasse and instead of
rocks, I had felt an iron slab down there.

01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.670
Iron slab?

01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:43.854
Mingma has even marked the spot
with a flag. Right?

01:17:43.878 --> 01:17:45.670
Yes, Santu but...

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.021
We won't find that flag
there anymore.

01:17:48.045 --> 01:17:50.795
I don't care about the flag.
We have to locate the spot.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.461
It is absolutely necessary
to investigate that spot.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.687
I'll go there myself
if I have to. Mingma?

01:17:56.711 --> 01:18:00.271
Yes, Santu. Don't worry.
We'll find Uncle no matter what.

01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:02.312
Excuse me, Columbus!

01:18:02.336 --> 01:18:05.979
Have you seen the sky?
A storm is coming.

01:18:06.003 --> 01:18:09.253
I suggest we all get out of here
the moment the helicopter arrives.

01:18:21.586 --> 01:18:23.836
The helicopter's here.
Come on. Let's go.

01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:27.961
- Mingma, let's go.
- Wait... Listen, Santu...

01:18:28.628 --> 01:18:32.104
Don't be stubborn. Come with us.
You and Mingma...

01:18:32.128 --> 01:18:36.545
You are forgetting Officer Verma.
I am a Roychowdhury too.

01:18:40.128 --> 01:18:41.808
I hope you get more medals and promotions.

01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:49.045
There's nothing we can do...

01:18:58.128 --> 01:19:01.878
What a stubborn guy!
He really is Kakababu's nephew!

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:22.336
- I was just saying that...
- Hello!

01:20:35.045 --> 01:20:38.545
The path was here
somewhere through the peaks.

01:20:39.128 --> 01:20:41.170
Should we go in that direction?

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:50.878
- Santu! See!
- The flag...

01:20:51.295 --> 01:20:53.615
- There it is! We found it! Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:27:10.878 --> 01:27:14.128
Santu! Found the iron slab!

01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:17.920
We found the iron slab!

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.003
I have a feeling you are minnow,
not the shark.

01:28:07.336 --> 01:28:12.878
Should I guess your name
or just presume you are Dr. Livingstone?

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:19.420
Stop fooling around Roychowdhury
and just stay where you are.

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:21.711
Wow! You are a Bengali recruit!

01:28:22.461 --> 01:28:27.086
There are so many international agents around
but they still sent a Bengali yeti to kill me?

01:28:27.336 --> 01:28:32.086
Yes! Because we wanted your last words
to be in your mother tongue!

01:28:32.628 --> 01:28:34.295
Wow! Fantastic!

01:28:34.336 --> 01:28:40.253
I have a nagging question
which only you can answer.

01:28:41.003 --> 01:28:44.170
Are yetis from West Bengal or East Bengal?

01:28:45.503 --> 01:28:46.795
You'll know the answer soon.

01:28:48.378 --> 01:28:51.586
My revolver has bullets
and I will count till three.

01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:53.711
Time for your last prayer...

01:28:54.461 --> 01:28:55.461
One...

01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:57.420
Two...

01:28:58.586 --> 01:28:59.586
Three...

01:29:05.086 --> 01:29:11.021
Did you really think by wearing
this cheap bear skin yeti costume or...

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:15.271
making those fake
footprints on the snow...

01:29:15.295 --> 01:29:17.295
you will scare me
and I will be scared?

01:29:17.961 --> 01:29:22.396
Exactly the same way you've been scaring
the locals for the last three years and...

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:28.437
your organisation has been taking advantage
to intercept our defence information...

01:29:28.461 --> 01:29:31.920
to sell it to various terrorist groups
beyond the borders.

01:29:32.003 --> 01:29:37.729
Well, you've got us. I thought the
fake bullet will give you a heart attack.

01:29:37.753 --> 01:29:40.336
Happens to a lot of people.
But didn't work on you.

01:29:40.545 --> 01:29:46.062
Therefore, plan B which is the second way
to make sure you die of natural causes.

01:29:46.086 --> 01:29:54.086
If I shoot, stab or poison you, the police will
suspect something when they find your body.

01:29:55.586 --> 01:29:57.795
They will increase their
patrolling of these parts.

01:29:58.003 --> 01:29:59.920
And it will hamper our business.

01:30:00.711 --> 01:30:03.003
That's why we have to
ensure natural deaths.

01:30:04.961 --> 01:30:09.711
By starvation... The way you killed the Chinese
man and left his body to scare us. Right?

01:30:10.128 --> 01:30:13.336
He knew too much.
So, we were ordered...

01:30:15.336 --> 01:30:20.670
Anyway, let's see how long
you can survive without food.

01:30:24.170 --> 01:30:25.378
Excuse me, Mister!

01:30:28.086 --> 01:30:31.461
I have bullets in my gun, Roychowdhury.
Let him go.

01:30:37.045 --> 01:30:38.086
You don't believe me?

01:30:42.795 --> 01:30:47.271
Wow! Your gun really
does have bullets!

01:30:47.295 --> 01:30:49.461
Congratulations! Should I get
some sweets too?

01:30:49.586 --> 01:30:50.586
Should we celebrate?

01:30:52.128 --> 01:30:53.711
Stop your gibberish! Come!

01:30:57.170 --> 01:30:59.503
- Aren't you going to tie my hands?
- No need for that.

01:31:00.003 --> 01:31:02.503
It's a Persian knot.
Even Alexander had tried and failed...

01:31:02.753 --> 01:31:05.003
Hmmm... An educated villain...
I'm loving it. Let's go...

01:33:10.003 --> 01:33:13.086
Can't we get out of here
through this window?

01:33:13.628 --> 01:33:17.545
No, Mr. Gupta. Its very rocky.
We will die for sure.

01:37:44.628 --> 01:37:45.628
Right in front of you...

01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:06.878
Santu, run!

01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:16.795
Santu, don't listen to them.

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:28.420
Santu, don't listen to them.
I forbid you.

01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:31.753
Santu, run away from here...

01:38:34.378 --> 01:38:38.086
If you come here, they will kill us both.
Run for your life!

01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:41.045
Go and inform the police.

01:38:54.003 --> 01:38:56.323
Santu, have you lost your mind?
Listen to what I am saying.

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.146
Your Kakababu is asking you not to come.
You must listen to me.

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:04.128
Santu, you are making me very angry now!

01:39:05.545 --> 01:39:07.465
Kakababu is asking you to get out of here!
Santu!

01:39:11.253 --> 01:39:14.128
I can hear you, Kakababu, but...

01:39:14.878 --> 01:39:16.295
Please forgive me.

01:39:17.295 --> 01:39:19.503
This once I will not be able to obey you...

01:39:20.003 --> 01:39:21.628
I cannot leave you behind...

01:39:24.878 --> 01:39:26.961
If we die, we will die together!

01:39:29.711 --> 01:39:35.146
Santu, stop arguing with your elders!
I forbid you to come here.

01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:39.336
Please, Santu, I'm begging you. Please, don't
come here. Please, run away from here...

01:39:44.961 --> 01:39:47.586
Santu, can you hear me?

01:39:49.586 --> 01:39:51.586
Please, don't come here, Santu!

01:40:48.128 --> 01:40:49.836
Look there! Right there!

01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:18.670
He is running away!

01:41:18.878 --> 01:41:19.878
He is running away!

01:41:20.586 --> 01:41:21.586
Catch him. Catch him.

01:41:30.086 --> 01:41:32.545
- Where did they go?
- They were right here...

01:41:34.211 --> 01:41:36.062
Two of you come with me.
We'll go that side and check.

01:41:36.086 --> 01:41:38.545
- Shine your torch that side...
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:41:40.836 --> 01:41:43.516
There... There... There...
One of them is getting away... Catch him.

01:43:08.003 --> 01:43:09.003
Catch that boy!

01:44:08.086 --> 01:44:09.253
Mingma, don't give up!

01:48:30.045 --> 01:48:32.086
There were a lot of underground caves here.

01:49:06.336 --> 01:49:08.586
Excuse me, Sir.

01:49:14.753 --> 01:49:15.795
I know where it is.

01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:51.545
Santu, are you okay?

01:52:52.045 --> 01:52:54.711
Yes, and Kakababu?

01:52:54.961 --> 01:52:56.253
He is okay.

01:52:59.295 --> 01:53:01.545
Santu, listen carefully.

01:53:01.711 --> 01:53:05.670
Take seven steps and then sit down.
Understood?

01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:08.503
Is it clear?

01:53:12.003 --> 01:53:14.628
After seven steps, blow them up.

01:53:50.753 --> 01:53:58.753
Not just India or Nepal, you've done a huge
favour for the entire world plagued by terrorism.

01:54:15.753 --> 01:54:19.086
I'm sure you guys must be quite hungry?

01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:24.479
Nothing.

01:54:24.503 --> 01:54:25.480
I'll tell you.

01:54:25.504 --> 01:54:32.253
He is thinking if the thirsty can't go to
the well, can the well come to the thirsty?

01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:08.878
It seems like something
is still bothering you.

01:55:10.378 --> 01:55:11.878
How did you know?

01:55:12.753 --> 01:55:15.170
That's why you are the nephew and I'm not.

01:55:15.711 --> 01:55:16.878
What happened?

01:55:17.503 --> 01:55:22.128
No, actually, it would have been nice
if yetis were real.

01:55:23.878 --> 01:55:26.295
I've been reading about them
since I was a kid...

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:33.461
Loch ness monster, yeti, roc bird,
dragon, unicorn...

01:55:34.378 --> 01:55:36.836
Almost like believing
that the Santa Claus is real...

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.312
The tales we hear, the stories we read...
Almost like being part of the mysterious family.

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:47.003
We can't see them
but they are there somewhere.

01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:53.086
Like a distant relative who has had
many adventures, right?

01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:00.920
Tch! My entire childhood just seems
like a lie now.

01:56:05.586 --> 01:56:08.795
Are you telling me
you've suddenly grown up?
