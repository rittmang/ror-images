00:02:11.252--> 00:02:19.252
"There is no end to the love given
by the one who embraces me."

00:02:20.013--> 00:02:22.863
"My most beloved has come..

00:02:22.943--> 00:02:29.265
There is endless light,
there is no end to it."

00:02:29.345--> 00:02:37.345
"There is no end to the love given
by the one who embraces me."

00:02:37.640--> 00:02:40.393
"My most beloved has come."

00:02:40.473--> 00:02:47.520
"There is endless light,
there is no end to it."

00:02:50.167--> 00:02:54.724
"He has given us the supreme secret."

00:02:54.804--> 00:02:58.037
"He has given us
fragrance in the flowers."

00:02:58.117--> 00:02:59.755
"He has swung us on delightful swings."

00:02:59.835--> 00:03:03.151
There is no end to his love."

00:03:06.384--> 00:03:13.487
"There is music in every step of the way."

00:03:13.567--> 00:03:20.720
"So many colours around
us to enchant us forever."

00:03:20.800--> 00:03:24.093
"There is no end to His favours."

00:03:24.260--> 00:03:31.460
"So many wonderful
stars touch our dreams."

00:03:31.540--> 00:03:35.500
"He has bestowed endless springs on us."

00:03:35.620--> 00:03:42.416
"He has given us limitless joy.
There is no end to His gifts."

00:03:45.659--> 00:03:52.820
"He has breathed life to
the entire earth since ages."

00:03:52.940--> 00:03:57.083
"Several sacred places
are put up to thank..

00:03:57.163--> 00:04:00.060
Him for his kindness."

00:04:00.140--> 00:04:03.460
"There is no end to His bounty."

00:04:03.790--> 00:04:10.820
"My companion has garlanded
me with bridal flowers."

00:04:10.900--> 00:04:17.980
"I'm beheld that my
heart is filled with love."

00:04:18.060--> 00:04:21.460
"There is no end to His gifts."

00:04:21.540--> 00:04:29.098
"There is no end to the love given
by the one who embraces me."

00:04:29.178--> 00:04:32.460
"My most beloved has come.."

00:04:32.540--> 00:04:39.580
"there is endless light,
there is no end to it."

00:04:42.541--> 00:04:46.381
Kali, people say you can't see.

00:04:47.303--> 00:04:50.816
That is true. I'm blind since birth.

00:04:51.108--> 00:04:56.141
Not at all. You see everything.
We can't see a thing.

00:04:58.159--> 00:05:00.211
Hey, give me, quick!

00:05:01.165--> 00:05:02.531
What do I give you?

00:05:02.611--> 00:05:06.202
Roasted lentils. Do you've it?

00:05:06.559--> 00:05:09.211
Suddenly master wants to eat
fish-head curry with lentils.

00:05:09.291--> 00:05:11.647
Here it is, taste some.

00:05:11.727--> 00:05:15.690
How can I eat? I don't have teeth.
I can swallow it.

00:05:16.815--> 00:05:21.484
Oh it's you?
Why are you making such a sad face?

00:05:21.678--> 00:05:23.731
It's daylight robbery.
- Meaning?

00:05:23.811--> 00:05:27.484
I'm over 55 years of age.
Can't work anymore.

00:05:27.564--> 00:05:29.611
Seems, it's the rule.
- Rule?

00:05:30.338--> 00:05:33.091
What will you eat? Fresh air.
- Fresh air?

00:05:34.674--> 00:05:38.123
Do you remember? When you had a job?

00:05:38.203--> 00:05:39.669
How you showed off!

00:05:39.842--> 00:05:42.691
I warned you, I said,
they won't employ you forever.

00:05:43.669--> 00:05:46.211
I've a great job!

00:05:46.291--> 00:05:48.934
When I'm gone for good only
then will I lose it. - Don't say that.

00:05:49.014--> 00:05:52.864
Here are your lentils.
- Come and get it.

00:05:53.604--> 00:05:56.630
Would you like a puff?
- No, I'm in hurry. Very much in a hurry.

00:05:59.531--> 00:06:02.731
Throw him out, I say,
throw the old servant out.

00:06:03.300--> 00:06:05.931
Why? He does everything.

00:06:06.359--> 00:06:07.759
Besides, he also looks after Sonny.

00:06:07.818--> 00:06:09.211
He can't manage anymore.

00:06:09.462--> 00:06:12.211
The other day he took him
for a stroll and I heard..

00:06:12.291--> 00:06:13.830
A cow came and pushed him!

00:06:14.187--> 00:06:16.371
He is old now.
How can he take care of him?

00:06:16.868--> 00:06:18.791
Finally, it was our
local cowherd who came..

00:06:18.964--> 00:06:20.371
And caught the cow.

00:06:20.586--> 00:06:23.611
You don't say!
I've to look for somebody else.

00:06:23.797--> 00:06:25.512
How long does it take to get lentils?

00:06:25.592--> 00:06:28.051
Here you are, madam, I've got the lentils.

00:06:32.211--> 00:06:33.291
Kali.
- Yes, sir.

00:06:34.046--> 00:06:36.532
Look out for the personnel.
- Why sir?

00:06:37.311--> 00:06:40.011
You're old now.
You can't manage this alone.

00:06:40.565--> 00:06:43.317
What did you say, sir?
What Kali can still do..

00:06:43.397--> 00:06:44.397
Kali!
- Yes, ma'am.

00:06:44.933--> 00:06:46.541
What did you bring from the store?

00:06:46.621--> 00:06:47.701
Roasted lentils.

00:06:47.781--> 00:06:51.701
It's sugar.
- Sugar?

00:06:51.781--> 00:06:53.021
Kali.
- Yes, sir.

00:06:53.701--> 00:06:55.077
I insist that you look for another worker.

00:06:55.101--> 00:06:57.901
This is not my fault, sir.
This is Sridhar's doing.

00:06:58.187--> 00:06:59.187
Sridhar..

00:07:11.695--> 00:07:14.175
Here's it. You gave me sugar!

00:07:17.415--> 00:07:19.175
You're old, Kali.

00:07:20.933--> 00:07:22.015
That I am.

00:07:25.442--> 00:07:30.095
You know, Hari,
I was boasting at that time. - Why?

00:07:31.701--> 00:07:33.175
I think I've to retire now.

00:07:35.415--> 00:07:36.895
Does that have anything in it?
- Yes.

00:07:37.139--> 00:07:38.175
Give me a puff.

00:08:17.787--> 00:08:20.467
Sister, sister!
- What is it?

00:08:20.787--> 00:08:25.107
I wanted to hit a sparrow,
the stone landed on dad's head!

00:08:25.187--> 00:08:26.267
What?

00:08:26.347--> 00:08:29.938
Charan, Charan! Charan!

00:08:31.019--> 00:08:32.019
Charan!

00:08:33.246--> 00:08:35.107
Where did he go?

00:08:35.603--> 00:08:36.684
Here he is, father.

00:08:36.868--> 00:08:39.307
Have a look, someone hit me on my head.

00:08:40.543--> 00:08:44.219
He is wearing a printed loin cloth.
Look over there.

00:08:44.878--> 00:08:46.673
I'll have a look, father.
- Go, have a look.

00:08:52.543--> 00:08:55.627
Have a look, indeed!
Where will you look for him?

00:08:56.813--> 00:08:59.159
Do you've to look for him?
- Yes, father.

00:08:59.239--> 00:09:02.314
Where will you search? In that haystack?
- Yes.

00:09:02.521--> 00:09:06.013
Finally, where will you find him?
- Where?

00:09:06.283--> 00:09:07.494
Here!

00:09:12.533--> 00:09:13.808
Here you are, father.

00:09:13.888--> 00:09:18.598
Oh! I can't chase him around.
- Where did you get hurt, father?

00:09:18.792--> 00:09:24.848
It's okay. I told her,
there is no need to fast for me.

00:09:25.085--> 00:09:27.728
She didn't listen. What was the use?

00:09:28.220--> 00:09:31.322
I'm still alive and she is in heaven!

00:09:31.657--> 00:09:33.497
Whom are you talking about, father?
- Who else?

00:09:33.568--> 00:09:36.316
Your mom! Who will take care of the lad?

00:09:36.500--> 00:09:37.888
I'll look after him, father.

00:09:40.662--> 00:09:44.229
Yes, you will. You will.

00:09:45.926--> 00:09:51.580
Bindu, it's just as well
that she is no more. Very good.

00:09:53.061--> 00:09:54.408
She would not be able to bear it.

00:09:55.439--> 00:09:59.341
You got widowed soon after marriage..
She would not be able to bear it.

00:10:01.028--> 00:10:05.633
Bindu, from now onward,
you're not only his sister..

00:10:06.336--> 00:10:09.291
You're everything to him.
You'll bring him up.

00:10:09.371--> 00:10:11.451
I will. I will, father.

00:10:12.748--> 00:10:16.737
And me? People have already
started calling me old Kali.

00:10:16.910--> 00:10:19.531
Who said you're old? I curse them.

00:10:19.774--> 00:10:23.331
You shouldn't say that.
They're our masters.

00:10:23.601--> 00:10:24.851
Our keepers.

00:10:29.245--> 00:10:31.571
Hasn't that servant come?

00:10:32.348--> 00:10:35.411
Why? Have you decided to keep him?

00:10:35.491--> 00:10:37.251
No, I asked him to look for someone.

00:10:37.811--> 00:10:40.251
You really can't rely on that old Kali.

00:10:40.812--> 00:10:45.571
I know that, ma'am.
So, I've brought you a servant.

00:10:46.206--> 00:10:47.926
Will you work in our house?

00:10:48.646--> 00:10:50.366
Yes. That is what father says.

00:10:50.910--> 00:10:52.153
What can you do?

00:10:52.726--> 00:10:55.265
I can run on one foot. I can play kabaddi.

00:10:55.646--> 00:10:58.726
I can aim the slingshot really accurately.

00:11:00.433--> 00:11:05.686
I can climb this tree. Can you?
- No.

00:11:06.108--> 00:11:07.108
Wait, see.

00:11:08.303--> 00:11:11.286
Charan, hey Charan!

00:11:13.200--> 00:11:14.446
Where has he gone?

00:11:15.326--> 00:11:17.726
Such a small boy!

00:11:18.726--> 00:11:21.526
Daddy, will he work in our house?

00:11:21.784--> 00:11:25.406
That'll be great, father.
He knows everything.

00:11:25.600--> 00:11:27.812
He can play kabaddi,
hit the slingshot well and he can..

00:11:27.892--> 00:11:29.646
Run on one foot.

00:11:30.216--> 00:11:32.126
Please show daddy once.

00:11:32.919--> 00:11:35.126
Mom, please let him stay here.

00:11:35.206--> 00:11:36.846
Very well, dear, very well.

00:11:36.926--> 00:11:38.006
Let's go out.

00:11:40.714--> 00:11:44.780
Kali, let him learn how to work,
after that..

00:11:44.953--> 00:11:50.186
I know, ma'am.
You want to discuss the wages, right?

00:11:50.824--> 00:11:53.846
You pay me, why does he need to be paid?

00:11:54.943--> 00:11:57.046
Kalicharan can't indulge
in daylight robbery.

00:11:58.056--> 00:12:01.646
Father has become old
so the boy is helping him out.

00:12:02.078--> 00:12:05.180
Let him learn the work
then you can pay him.

00:12:05.260--> 00:12:06.332
Daddy!

00:12:08.607--> 00:12:12.726
Daddy, he is no good.
- Why?

00:12:13.201--> 00:12:16.537
He knows all the games
but he isn't playing with me.

00:12:18.261--> 00:12:19.457
What is your name?

00:12:19.990--> 00:12:23.514
I was born after prayers to Goddess Kali.

00:12:23.594--> 00:12:25.257
So my name is Kalicharan.

00:12:25.893--> 00:12:30.017
I had gone with his mom to Brindaban.
He was born there.

00:12:30.379--> 00:12:32.217
So I named him Raicharan.

00:12:33.742--> 00:12:37.377
Raicharan,
now why won't you play with him?

00:12:37.839--> 00:12:39.377
That is your work.

00:12:42.779--> 00:12:46.377
Father has told me that
servants shouldn't play.

00:12:46.975--> 00:12:48.657
A servant should serve his master.

00:12:49.737--> 00:12:54.017
But when the master orders you to play,
you must obey.

00:12:55.061--> 00:12:58.897
You can't disobey the master!
What do you say, Kalicharan?

00:12:59.137--> 00:13:00.937
Service is our duty.

00:13:01.515--> 00:13:06.377
I order you to run on one foot.
- Okay.

00:13:17.992--> 00:13:19.312
Here.
- No.

00:13:19.548--> 00:13:22.992
It's your master's order, drink up!
- Okay.

00:13:30.825--> 00:13:32.672
Now he has forgotten me too!

00:13:34.241--> 00:13:37.392
Earlier he used to just roam
around and check on me several times.

00:13:38.130--> 00:13:40.392
Now his sister is a stranger!

00:13:40.648--> 00:13:42.992
You think he works over there?
- Well then?

00:13:44.072--> 00:13:46.701
He only plays kabaddi
and runs on one foot with..

00:13:46.781--> 00:13:48.272
The young master.

00:13:48.352--> 00:13:51.392
I see! Then he is not
a master but a playmate!

00:13:51.472--> 00:13:52.672
In a way, yes.

00:13:53.457--> 00:13:54.552
Where is he?

00:13:55.072--> 00:13:56.086
Let him be wherever he is.

00:13:56.110--> 00:13:59.759
He must be hiding somewhere
and playing pranks!

00:13:59.965--> 00:14:01.992
Where is he? Charan!

00:14:04.311--> 00:14:05.311
Charan!

00:14:07.975--> 00:14:09.370
Why are you lying down?

00:14:09.813--> 00:14:11.965
No, it's nothing.
- It's nothing?

00:14:12.192--> 00:14:16.040
Let me have a look.
Oh dear, you're burning with fever!

00:14:17.143--> 00:14:19.294
Keep lying down.
No point eating today.

00:14:23.305--> 00:14:25.782
Father, Charan is burning with fever!

00:14:26.549--> 00:14:27.598
But natural!

00:14:27.678--> 00:14:29.140
The young master wanted to see..

00:14:29.220--> 00:14:32.917
So all day he rode the bullock
in the neighboring village.

00:14:33.793--> 00:14:34.968
Give me some rice.

00:14:42.442--> 00:14:44.168
I spoke to Satish, the tutor.

00:14:45.231--> 00:14:46.671
Anu will go to school from tomorrow.

00:14:48.734--> 00:14:50.637
Raicharan will deliver
his lunch at school.

00:14:52.312--> 00:14:53.888
Satish is a very strict teacher.

00:14:54.345--> 00:14:55.599
Any prank and he'll get beaten.

00:14:56.177--> 00:14:58.756
You know, dad,
today Charan rode that stubborn bull of..

00:14:58.836--> 00:15:01.377
Ours at our old house.

00:15:01.761--> 00:15:04.113
As soon as the bullock
charged with his horns..

00:15:04.193--> 00:15:07.217
Charan took hold of
his horns and sat on his back.

00:15:11.017--> 00:15:13.415
If Raicharan continues working here,..

00:15:13.495--> 00:15:16.257
He'll be the third generation
of that family working here.

00:15:16.497--> 00:15:19.902
Did Kalicharan's father work here too?
- Yes.

00:15:21.372--> 00:15:24.820
See, the relationship with
retainers like him is not..

00:15:25.144--> 00:15:27.584
Exactly like the worker-employer
relationship in an office.

00:15:29.707--> 00:15:31.217
They begin in a small way.

00:15:32.345--> 00:15:35.257
Gradually, they win over everything.

00:15:36.160--> 00:15:39.339
Over the time they develop so much
that it is hard to tell who is bigger.

00:15:40.009--> 00:15:42.137
The master or the disciple.

00:15:44.518--> 00:15:48.297
Father, Charan doesn't
have fever this morning.

00:15:48.530--> 00:15:49.937
Let him rest today.

00:15:50.337--> 00:15:52.577
Very well, I agree.

00:16:02.035--> 00:16:05.275
Have this barley. Where did he go?

00:16:05.870--> 00:16:06.995
Charan!

00:16:07.687--> 00:16:11.621
Father! Father, I'm absolutely fine now.

00:16:11.701--> 00:16:13.715
I beg of you, please let me go with you.

00:16:13.795--> 00:16:17.675
Charan, Charan! Get into bed at once!

00:16:17.977--> 00:16:19.296
Father..

00:16:19.376--> 00:16:24.301
Go and lie down quietly.
No running around today, okay?

00:16:24.381--> 00:16:26.635
Come and have this barley.

00:16:34.021--> 00:16:35.475
Wait.

00:16:39.221--> 00:16:43.729
'One night I dreamt,
someone said, look at me, look at me.'

00:16:43.967--> 00:16:46.272
'I stared and saw the big thief.

00:16:46.352--> 00:16:48.595
I go by leisurely to Kolkata.'

00:16:48.769--> 00:16:50.689
'The houses there were
erect and made of bricks.'

00:16:50.835--> 00:16:52.955
'There are windows and doors too.'

00:16:53.137--> 00:16:55.235
'The roads twist and turn like snakes.'

00:16:55.315--> 00:16:57.355
'The trams storm on those
with a thud and a thwack!'

00:16:57.526--> 00:16:59.475
'The shops and stores
are buzzing with life.'

00:16:59.709--> 00:17:01.915
'The top of the house beats its head.'

00:17:02.207--> 00:17:04.235
'The Howrah bridge is like a crown.'

00:17:04.315--> 00:17:06.395
'Life hums behind it up and down.'

00:17:06.661--> 00:17:08.835
'People are walking everywhere in droves.'

00:17:08.955--> 00:17:11.115
'Under their feet lies
the earth vanquished.'

00:17:11.429--> 00:17:13.475
'Our school speeds ahead at a brisk pace.'

00:17:13.732--> 00:17:15.786
'The math book tries to join in the race.'

00:17:16.067--> 00:17:17.955
'The maps adorn the walls noisily.'

00:17:18.035--> 00:17:22.435
The basic duties in life.
Supreme devotion to parents.

00:17:22.760--> 00:17:24.813
Loyalty of subjects to their king..

00:17:25.073--> 00:17:27.576
The devotion that
Hanuman had toward Rama..

00:17:27.656--> 00:17:30.506
Equals to the devotion
that Rabindranath had towards..

00:17:30.586--> 00:17:33.635
Our ancient heritage. They're equal.

00:17:33.841--> 00:17:36.986
There are inspiring
tales of sacrifice here.

00:17:37.397--> 00:17:41.435
For instance the sage
sat meditating on the mountain.

00:17:41.700--> 00:17:45.273
He meditated beyond the
limits of physical endurance.

00:17:45.353--> 00:17:48.795
His mind was strong and
got stronger with penance.

00:17:49.116--> 00:17:52.651
Even though he had
left home for a long time..

00:17:53.148--> 00:17:57.494
After many,
many days a guest has come to my house.

00:17:57.916--> 00:18:01.863
My old companion, my ancient heritage.

00:18:02.046--> 00:18:06.307
Charan, you go to school
with the young master.

00:18:07.269--> 00:18:09.235
Does the teacher scold him?

00:18:09.680--> 00:18:11.475
Why? Why would he scold him?

00:18:12.047--> 00:18:15.496
Instead, everyone says
young master will stand first!

00:18:16.686--> 00:18:19.378
Definitely!
He'll become a judge, magistrate..

00:18:19.691--> 00:18:24.048
Or accountant or chief justice.
He'll surely be one of these.

00:18:25.378--> 00:18:26.999
Is studying very risky, father?

00:18:28.254--> 00:18:29.346
Why, why do you say that?

00:18:29.426--> 00:18:32.319
You said so yourself.
Judge, chief justice..

00:18:33.876--> 00:18:37.032
You'll see when you grow up.
He is certain to be one of those.

00:18:45.479--> 00:18:53.172
Judge! Magistrate! Chief justice!

00:20:10.079--> 00:20:14.039
Mom, today,
I got a poor subject to get his dues.

00:20:14.674--> 00:20:18.393
I say, child, I can't bear
to live in this empty house alone.

00:20:19.355--> 00:20:20.919
I know of a suitable girl.

00:20:21.355--> 00:20:23.759
Mom, as soon as I get a promotion, I'll..

00:20:23.839--> 00:20:25.342
Your bride will get what's in her destiny.

00:20:25.366--> 00:20:28.663
Certainly, certainly! You're right, mom.

00:20:29.442--> 00:20:31.950
Mom, what photos are these?

00:20:33.312--> 00:20:34.512
My future sister-in-law?

00:20:34.857--> 00:20:38.352
Oh, what a fine countenance,
I think you should fix the union!

00:20:38.432--> 00:20:40.641
You don't need to get carried away!

00:20:40.721--> 00:20:43.365
This month is auspicious,
after this it will be delayed.

00:20:43.445--> 00:20:45.048
No, we'll do it in this
month of Shrabon itself!

00:20:45.072--> 00:20:47.192
What about the arrangements?
- Just say tell me..

00:20:47.272--> 00:20:50.752
I'll arrange for
not one but three weddings!

00:20:50.832--> 00:20:53.768
You need to decide first whether
you want Indian musicians or a brass band.

00:20:53.792--> 00:20:56.712
Hari Sarkar in our village
is a talented musician.

00:20:57.288--> 00:21:04.726
Sister, sister!
You've the supplies for a week.

00:21:04.996--> 00:21:06.808
You won't see me for a week.

00:21:07.591--> 00:21:09.328
Why on earth?

00:21:09.602--> 00:21:12.618
I won't tell you beforehand.
It hampers good work.

00:21:12.698--> 00:21:16.248
Alright. Uncle Satish from had come here.
- Why?

00:21:16.368--> 00:21:18.587
Remember father had arranged
for your marriage while he was alive?

00:21:18.611--> 00:21:21.288
They're very eager to get
the girl married. Very well.

00:21:21.368--> 00:21:22.303
Then it will be in the month of Shrabon.

00:21:22.383--> 00:21:25.088
How can that be?
How can it take place in Shrabon?

00:21:25.168--> 00:21:27.328
It is a marriage,
you can't just go for it.

00:21:27.408--> 00:21:28.888
You need to make proper arrangements.

00:21:28.968--> 00:21:30.334
We'll do that some other time.

00:21:30.414--> 00:21:32.269
It'll get delayed.
- So be it.

00:21:32.349--> 00:21:33.967
Not possible?
- Why not?

00:21:34.047--> 00:21:35.527
How many times can I change the date?

00:21:35.696--> 00:21:36.944
When they say it'll be
in the month of Jyeshtha..

00:21:36.968--> 00:21:39.142
I say it'll be in Shrabon,
when Shrabon comes I delay it further.

00:21:39.166--> 00:21:40.837
They have visited three times already.

00:21:40.917--> 00:21:41.832
It must be in Shrabon.

00:21:41.912--> 00:21:43.367
You take a look at the supplies.

00:21:43.447--> 00:21:45.448
We'll talk about this later.
I'm going now.

00:21:45.608--> 00:21:47.368
How about lunch?
- No time!

00:21:48.091--> 00:21:49.208
What did they say?

00:21:49.288--> 00:21:51.808
They have committed elsewhere.

00:21:52.210--> 00:21:54.482
We can use good shehnai (musical
instrument) players, can't we?

00:21:54.506--> 00:21:55.648
Yes, of course.

00:21:55.728--> 00:21:59.507
It is just a matter of music,
only Charan will object!

00:22:00.288--> 00:22:01.928
That silly boy!

00:22:02.008--> 00:22:04.644
Mom, I'll be back soon. Charan,
the bride's family is coming today.

00:22:04.668--> 00:22:05.788
I'll be back right away!

00:22:05.868--> 00:22:08.068
They're coming in the evening.
- There is time for that.

00:22:09.582--> 00:22:11.408
No band indeed!

00:22:11.836--> 00:22:14.739
Hey you! Great instruments!
What do you mean?

00:22:14.819--> 00:22:16.572
Well, you do play instruments
so instead of calling..

00:22:16.596--> 00:22:18.516
You instrumentalists
I called you instruments.

00:22:19.280--> 00:22:22.076
Charan, what do you want?
- I want everything, everything.

00:22:22.480--> 00:22:23.345
That's not possible.

00:22:23.425--> 00:22:25.346
Say that to someone else.

00:22:25.426--> 00:22:28.167
We'll see once the wedding is done with.
I'm leaving.

00:22:28.340--> 00:22:29.596
Hey listen!

00:22:29.676--> 00:22:32.956
Listen, wait!
- What do you want to say?

00:22:33.303--> 00:22:35.065
If there is no band for master's wedding..

00:22:35.145--> 00:22:38.116
I'll see how you play
it at any other wedding!

00:22:38.968--> 00:22:40.276
No band indeed!

00:23:04.861--> 00:23:08.796
What racket is this?
- You said there would be no band.

00:23:09.629--> 00:23:12.469
Just wait and see on the wedding day,
if there is a band playing or not!

00:23:12.760--> 00:23:14.349
No band at master's wedding indeed!

00:23:58.381--> 00:24:01.289
Where is my spot? I need to sit here.

00:24:04.792--> 00:24:12.326
Priest, chant the verses well!
Ask him to read well.

00:24:37.233--> 00:24:39.353
Brother Charan, give me the key please!

00:24:39.839--> 00:24:42.113
I won't part with the key.
Tell me what you want.

00:24:42.233--> 00:24:43.913
Sweetmeat. Give this to me.

00:25:15.299--> 00:25:19.873
Raicharan is celebrating,
come let's see. Come.

00:25:39.761--> 00:25:41.761
Now you say,
either on Sunday or Wednesday?!

00:25:41.841--> 00:25:42.921
So what?

00:25:43.001--> 00:25:44.481
There is only one day in between!

00:25:44.561--> 00:25:47.761
It's fine.
See, we get married on Wednesday.

00:25:48.102--> 00:25:49.761
On Friday we've the nuptial night.

00:25:49.841--> 00:25:51.161
Then the celebrations!

00:25:51.442--> 00:25:52.641
You're mad!

00:25:52.761--> 00:25:54.827
What are you saying?
This is the wedding time already!

00:25:54.851--> 00:25:55.775
Won't you see the girl?

00:25:55.855--> 00:25:57.671
See, father has already
seen her and chosen her.

00:25:57.695--> 00:25:59.815
Why should I waste time in that?

00:25:59.895--> 00:26:01.676
Do you know when do
the poor see the bride?

00:26:01.855--> 00:26:03.535
Just after the wedding has been performed.

00:26:04.000--> 00:26:09.103
Since you're so insistent,
you may as well get it done with!

00:26:09.815--> 00:26:10.895
What say!

00:26:14.575--> 00:26:21.375
It must be done by Friday! Then it's fun!
- Totally mad!

00:26:21.495--> 00:26:23.975
There is no auspicious day after Monday.

00:26:24.401--> 00:26:27.135
I can't leave the
house with the new bride.

00:26:27.352--> 00:26:32.464
He said he'd come.
You can leave on Saturday. - Okay.

00:26:39.459--> 00:26:41.794
Can't the house be
guarded without Raicharan?

00:26:42.302--> 00:26:43.977
It's not just about guarding the house.

00:26:44.205--> 00:26:46.832
He also sorts the mail
and does so many other things.

00:26:47.642--> 00:26:50.855
Will Raicharan take care of everything?
I can do it too.

00:26:51.296--> 00:26:54.593
It's not that.
Right now we aren't staying here.

00:26:55.144--> 00:26:57.255
We do need him here.

00:28:01.508--> 00:28:04.213
Sister, give some bread!
- Here. - Quick, give it to me.

00:28:04.484--> 00:28:05.484
Here's the plate.

00:28:07.908--> 00:28:10.308
Hey Sonny, you've come alone.

00:28:11.413--> 00:28:14.388
Arna, where's your mom?
Here, have some bread.

00:28:14.873--> 00:28:16.228
Here, bread.

00:28:19.348--> 00:28:22.508
Go on, eat up! No need to feel shy.

00:28:23.381--> 00:28:29.508
Here, have this. It's piping hot! Take.

00:28:29.908--> 00:28:31.028
I'll get more. Here.

00:28:31.770--> 00:28:33.268
Here. It has gone cold.

00:28:33.727--> 00:28:34.788
It's hot.

00:28:35.188--> 00:28:37.250
Get us piping hot ones.
- Okay.

00:28:41.376--> 00:28:44.496
Why sit so far? Take off the veil.

00:28:45.790--> 00:28:48.816
Let's see how long you feel shy.
Come girls.

00:29:11.174--> 00:29:13.845
Why feel shy now? There is no one here.

00:29:14.126--> 00:29:15.250
You can say what you want.

00:29:17.261--> 00:29:22.576
Hey! You know they can't do
without me at all. - Who?

00:29:22.656--> 00:29:26.223
Those people, where I work.
- Oh.

00:29:26.764--> 00:29:32.570
Nice, this is nice.
The pillows are so soft.

00:29:33.511--> 00:29:34.511
Is it from your father?

00:29:34.905--> 00:29:37.856
Very good.
I have never slept in a bed like this.

00:29:38.343--> 00:29:40.536
I'm so tired after working
at the wedding all day.

00:29:40.948--> 00:29:41.988
Why are you staring at me?

00:29:42.343--> 00:29:44.096
I had to work at my own wedding.

00:29:44.300--> 00:29:48.256
Do you think I can enjoy
this soft bed for a few days? - Why?

00:29:48.336--> 00:29:49.496
What do you mean, why?

00:29:49.802--> 00:29:51.736
My employers are going
to Benaras for a few days.

00:29:52.019--> 00:29:54.152
I've to take over the
responsibility of the entire house.

00:29:54.176--> 00:29:57.868
Can I ignore all that and
simply keep lying on this soft bed?

00:29:59.175--> 00:30:03.240
Tell me, can I?
Oh no! That's not what Raicharan does.

00:30:03.900--> 00:30:07.802
You know, my employers
don't know of this marriage.

00:30:08.440--> 00:30:10.576
I didn't tell them. Do you know why?

00:30:10.656--> 00:30:13.816
If I tell them that I'm getting married
they won't leave on Saturday.

00:30:13.896--> 00:30:14.950
Their departure would be delayed.

00:30:14.974--> 00:30:18.656
I told you I've to take on
the entire responsibility from now.

00:30:18.843--> 00:30:20.003
Your master is here.

00:30:20.083--> 00:30:25.144
What? Master is here?
Get up. Get up! Master!

00:30:25.909--> 00:30:26.817
Is this for me?

00:30:26.897--> 00:30:28.126
Don't make a fuss!

00:30:28.206--> 00:30:29.380
How do I wear it?

00:30:56.850--> 00:30:59.067
Tell me, what did you
talk about last night?

00:31:03.639--> 00:31:07.607
What could we talk about? Nothing really.

00:31:20.927--> 00:31:23.654
Listen, the guard will
look after the house at night.

00:31:23.734--> 00:31:26.754
You come in early and
do all the cleaning, okay?

00:31:26.927--> 00:31:28.414
You stay here all day.

00:31:28.494--> 00:31:30.774
Don't worry about a thing!

00:31:30.934--> 00:31:32.014
Give me the key.

00:31:33.316--> 00:31:34.907
Don't delay,
take the goddess' name and start.

00:31:34.931--> 00:31:38.334
Come on, get in. Get in, get in.

00:31:58.506--> 00:31:59.934
Hail Durga!

00:32:02.409--> 00:32:04.094
Is the rice cooked?

00:32:18.830--> 00:32:20.150
Won't you go back?

00:32:21.565--> 00:32:23.390
He is not an employer but a God for me.

00:32:24.203--> 00:32:26.510
He has given me the entire
responsibility of the house.

00:32:26.590--> 00:32:30.289
Since I'm newly married, I get nights off!

00:32:40.253--> 00:32:41.333
Sit.

00:33:04.221--> 00:33:07.501
Oh dear! I haven't given the key!
- Meaning?

00:33:07.621--> 00:33:09.197
I had opened the store
room at my master's.

00:33:09.221--> 00:33:11.461
I forgot to lock it. I'll be back soon.

00:33:11.701--> 00:33:14.636
So what if you didn't lock it?
There are others.

00:33:14.716--> 00:33:17.221
What if something gets lost? No, no!

00:33:20.181--> 00:33:22.621
Why are you bothered only about them?

00:33:22.701--> 00:33:25.021
Why? Everything is fine here.

00:33:26.021--> 00:33:27.414
Aren't you my husband?

00:33:27.494--> 00:33:31.341
What do you think? Look at me. Let me go.

00:33:33.900--> 00:33:36.462
What are you?

00:33:36.992--> 00:33:43.229
Me? I'm Raicharan. Move, move quick!

00:35:47.388--> 00:35:50.548
Mom, Mom!
- What is it?

00:35:50.628--> 00:35:53.908
We must leave for Barasat right away.

00:35:53.988--> 00:35:55.708
Or else the train will get crowded.

00:35:55.788--> 00:35:58.748
We can't go today, dear.
- Why, mom?

00:36:00.703--> 00:36:02.228
I'll tell you. Come here.

00:36:04.422--> 00:36:06.381
Your well-wisher, mom.

00:36:06.714--> 00:36:09.221
Where are you going? Sit, sit, sit!

00:36:10.021--> 00:36:11.621
Read it to me nicely once more.

00:36:11.861--> 00:36:15.892
Read it again? Yes, read it again.
Go on, read it. Okay, listen.

00:36:16.861--> 00:36:20.741
By the grace of Lord Shiva we're all well.

00:36:21.021--> 00:36:24.901
I've left for our village
home with Anu and his wife.

00:36:25.334--> 00:36:27.774
Sister! Hail Lord Shiva!

00:36:27.854--> 00:36:30.334
Sister, here. I've good news!

00:36:30.574--> 00:36:31.505
What is it?

00:36:31.585--> 00:36:36.254
You know everything.
Look at me and guess what it could be.

00:36:36.534--> 00:36:37.774
Go on, guess.

00:36:38.014--> 00:36:41.094
Are your employers back from Benaras?
- No, no, you didn't get it.

00:36:41.334--> 00:36:43.494
Then, you got a raise.
- No!

00:36:43.574--> 00:36:48.334
Then what is it? - Master is coming.
See, ma'am wrote a letter.

00:36:49.127--> 00:36:52.954
No, you can't read it!
Ma'am has said to keep it a secret.

00:36:53.034--> 00:36:57.534
Understood? Don't tell anyone. I warn you.

00:37:06.716--> 00:37:11.014
Charan, you too are married
and have set up home.

00:37:11.732--> 00:37:13.374
You too will have children some day.

00:37:13.862--> 00:37:15.614
You can celebrate that in a big way.

00:37:15.916--> 00:37:17.436
Have you ever thought of these things?

00:37:17.516--> 00:37:22.705
What! No, I didn't. I will, I will.

00:37:23.483--> 00:37:24.483
Give.

00:37:35.278--> 00:37:37.974
Raicharan, Raicharan!
- Yes, sister-in-law!

00:37:38.254--> 00:37:41.591
Did you inform Bani?
- Yes I did.

00:37:42.413--> 00:37:44.894
I can't manage this boy. I wish he'd come.

00:37:46.185--> 00:37:47.774
Sister-in-law, give him to me.

00:37:48.423--> 00:37:50.762
You can't manage the household
work and you want to take him.

00:37:50.786--> 00:37:52.774
Let Bani come and do the household work.

00:37:53.110--> 00:37:56.040
Give him to me. Come dear, come.

00:37:56.570--> 00:37:59.229
O dear! O dear! O dear!

00:38:03.187--> 00:38:08.037
What are you doing?
- I'm playing! We're playing, aren't we?

00:38:08.117--> 00:38:09.756
Can you go now, please? I want to work.

00:38:09.836--> 00:38:11.868
Come let's go, daddy wants to work.

00:38:12.225--> 00:38:15.133
Okay sonny,
let's go and get some fresh air.

00:38:15.587--> 00:38:17.176
Come, daddy will work now.

00:38:17.256--> 00:38:20.376
Sister, come here quick!
- Why? What happened?

00:38:20.657--> 00:38:23.013
Don't give the baby to Raicharan.
He'll be ruined.

00:38:23.240--> 00:38:25.069
What?
- Yes.

00:38:26.710--> 00:38:34.398
Here you go, up in the air! Here..

00:38:34.571--> 00:38:37.121
Raicharan! What are you doing? He'll fall.

00:38:37.338--> 00:38:39.738
Nothing will happen, don't worry.

00:38:42.440--> 00:38:50.440
Look at that, who is this?
Who is this now? No crying.

00:38:50.600--> 00:38:54.364
I kept bouncing him and catching him!
Like this.

00:38:55.089--> 00:38:58.600
Sister-in-law was worried.
She thought he'd fall.

00:38:58.680--> 00:39:00.480
It's natural.
- Why?

00:39:00.699--> 00:39:03.520
Come, I'll bounce you up and hold you!

00:39:04.353--> 00:39:07.320
Sister, now the little
boy won't stay with anyone else.

00:39:08.094--> 00:39:09.294
He only wants to stay with me.

00:39:14.050--> 00:39:16.600
I'm very late today. Wait!
- What?

00:39:17.012--> 00:39:18.680
The other day,
your wife's brother had come.

00:39:18.704--> 00:39:21.424
She was very embarrassed
as you were in a torn shirt.

00:39:21.504--> 00:39:23.104
Get yourself a new shirt.

00:39:23.305--> 00:39:24.872
Who was embarrassed?
- Your wife.

00:39:24.952--> 00:39:26.784
Bah!
- Listen! - What is it?

00:39:26.904--> 00:39:29.584
Get a new one.
- Give me the money.

00:39:29.664--> 00:39:31.384
Here.
- Hurry, I'm getting late!

00:39:31.504--> 00:39:33.184
Wait a minute.

00:39:33.264--> 00:39:35.822
My wife sees me in a torn shirt
and is embarrassed, indeed!

00:39:37.260--> 00:39:39.779
My wife sees me in a torn shirt
and is embarrassed, indeed!

00:39:40.774--> 00:39:43.357
Do you've a shirt?
- Yes.

00:39:43.437--> 00:39:45.784
Give me. Quick, give me.

00:39:48.038--> 00:39:50.946
Wow, this is a great shirt! How much?

00:39:51.163--> 00:39:52.704
Re. 1.25.

00:40:01.421--> 00:40:02.421
No, this is bigger.

00:40:08.144--> 00:40:10.330
Do you have a ball?
- Here you are.

00:40:10.664--> 00:40:12.584
How much? 25 paisa.
- 25 paisa?

00:40:13.206--> 00:40:14.224
Okay.

00:40:17.664--> 00:40:18.744
Here you go.

00:40:19.541--> 00:40:20.664
Don't you want the shirt?

00:40:20.744--> 00:40:22.665
Shirt?
- Yes. Okay, give.

00:40:23.119--> 00:40:25.199
How much did you say it was?
I told you, rupees 1.25.

00:40:25.800--> 00:40:27.344
Oh dear, I'm short of money.

00:40:29.064--> 00:40:30.671
How much is this?
- This is for 75 paisa.

00:40:30.751--> 00:40:32.991
75 paisa? Okay, give me this one.
Give me the meaner one.

00:40:34.599--> 00:40:35.599
Here's the money.

00:40:36.024--> 00:40:37.399
Oh, forget the folding!

00:40:37.864--> 00:40:44.156
Come, see this. Come here.

00:40:44.383--> 00:40:52.024
Come on, quick. Come, come.

00:40:52.104--> 00:40:56.361
Come, come on.

00:40:57.236--> 00:41:01.356
Come, come.

00:41:05.810--> 00:41:09.497
Come, come.

00:41:10.815--> 00:41:12.870
Come, come.

00:41:23.777--> 00:41:28.220
O dear! Sister-in-law, come here, quick!

00:41:28.956--> 00:41:36.864
What happened? - Look what Sonny did?
Come on, show us. Come on.

00:41:37.344--> 00:41:42.824
Come, come, come on quick.

00:41:44.424--> 00:41:52.424
Come, come, come on quick.

00:41:56.174--> 00:42:01.483
Come, come, come on, quick. What's this?

00:42:03.678--> 00:42:06.424
See his deeds! See!

00:42:06.504--> 00:42:08.602
Saw that? Saw what he did?

00:42:08.682--> 00:42:11.322
What's the big deal? All children do that.

00:42:11.402--> 00:42:13.482
Not at all. No one has done it like this.

00:42:13.688--> 00:42:14.962
Your son will be a judge.

00:42:15.042--> 00:42:18.281
Take my word, he'll do great things.
Remember what I say.

00:42:18.454--> 00:42:19.802
Come, come, let's go out.

00:42:19.922--> 00:42:25.162
Okay sonny, tell me, who is this?
- Mom!

00:42:25.395--> 00:42:27.162
He is calling you mom.

00:42:27.242--> 00:42:29.643
And who is she?
- Aunt. Aunt!

00:42:29.723--> 00:42:31.722
And who am I?
- Charan.

00:42:31.802--> 00:42:34.946
Charan! He calls me Charan!

00:42:35.026--> 00:42:36.202
I'll go and tell master.

00:42:38.324--> 00:42:41.402
Daughter-in-law,
what time did Charan return last night?

00:42:41.562--> 00:42:42.642
Very late.

00:42:42.722--> 00:42:44.399
Is he still in bed?

00:42:45.469--> 00:42:50.082
He left at night.
He had to purchase an animal mask.

00:42:51.275--> 00:42:53.242
He was to take you to the Nobogram fair.

00:42:54.002--> 00:42:55.264
Did you tell him?

00:42:56.691--> 00:42:58.802
Where does he have
the time to listen to me?

00:42:59.437--> 00:43:01.562
He is so busy with Sonny there.

00:43:02.540--> 00:43:05.718
How Sonny calls his mom, mom.
Calls his aunt, 'aunt.'

00:43:06.172--> 00:43:09.282
And him, he calls him by name.

00:43:15.349--> 00:43:18.344
Charan? - Yes.
- Charan. - Yes.

00:43:19.003--> 00:43:22.002
I'm to get a transfer.
- Where?

00:43:22.377--> 00:43:26.518
To Munshiganj.
- Oh. What will you do?

00:43:28.107--> 00:43:29.107
Say something.

00:43:29.162--> 00:43:32.722
What do I say?
Wherever Sonny goes, I'll go too.

00:43:32.802--> 00:43:33.922
When do we leave?

00:43:34.291--> 00:43:35.322
In a few days.

00:43:35.999--> 00:43:39.322
Then there is a lot to be done.
Have to finish it all.

00:43:40.057--> 00:43:42.897
Want to go to the fair, sister!
- What?

00:43:43.057--> 00:43:46.057
Did you mention about
visiting village Nobo? - Yes.

00:43:46.237--> 00:43:49.382
The fair is today. - Who will take us?
- Why? The speaker.

00:44:09.552--> 00:44:11.564
Oh no, why are you holding my hand?

00:44:11.644--> 00:44:13.072
What if I get lost?

00:44:13.489--> 00:44:14.792
C'mon!

00:45:46.604--> 00:45:50.884
These are really nice.
These are beautiful!

00:45:54.030--> 00:45:57.964
The sari too is very pretty. Who chose it?

00:46:00.105--> 00:46:04.604
Listen, tonight you
must wear all these, okay?

00:46:04.894--> 00:46:10.884
Yummy! The vegetables are so tasty!
Who cooked it?

00:46:11.283--> 00:46:14.484
Your wife!
- Wonderful! Give me some more!

00:46:19.364--> 00:46:21.164
Go on, give some more.

00:46:28.191--> 00:46:29.564
That's enough.

00:46:36.310--> 00:46:40.700
Wife, we hardly ever talk!

00:46:40.894--> 00:46:43.867
How can we? Where is the time?

00:46:44.051--> 00:46:45.644
True, very true!

00:46:46.029--> 00:46:49.524
You haven't gone to your
master's house for the entire day!

00:46:49.802--> 00:46:52.495
Have you taken a holiday?
- Not a holiday.

00:46:52.798--> 00:46:55.284
You wanted to go to
the fair so I stayed back.

00:46:58.160--> 00:47:04.284
Master is getting
transferred to Munshiganj.

00:47:05.447--> 00:47:06.788
Will you go too?

00:47:06.868--> 00:47:10.875
See, sonny can't do without me.
So they said that..

00:47:10.955--> 00:47:14.670
You should go.
What did you say? That you'd go?

00:47:14.750--> 00:47:16.670
I didn't say that.

00:47:16.864--> 00:47:18.654
I hope you told them you won't go.

00:47:18.734--> 00:47:21.971
No, I didn't tell them that either.
I said I'd go.

00:47:23.210--> 00:47:25.491
Very good!
- What did you say?

00:47:25.665--> 00:47:30.714
Very good? I knew you'd say this.

00:47:30.794--> 00:47:33.851
Hey, where are Sonny's toys?

00:47:34.162--> 00:47:35.522
The ones we brought from the fair?

00:47:36.216--> 00:47:37.216
What happened?

00:47:55.840--> 00:48:01.698
Wife, why did you take
off the sari and jewellery..

00:48:02.444--> 00:48:03.720
We brought from the fair?

00:48:04.281--> 00:48:06.360
You gave those to me with so much love.

00:48:07.120--> 00:48:11.979
If I use them everyday they
will get spoilt. So, I kept them away.

00:48:12.059--> 00:48:14.840
Oh, you're keeping them away? Very good!

00:48:14.920--> 00:48:19.200
Listen, I'll go to the goldsmith
tomorrow and make you a necklace, okay?

00:48:22.617--> 00:48:24.880
Here are the toys.

00:49:21.931--> 00:49:23.011
Why did you do that?

00:49:23.091--> 00:49:24.451
It can take more stuff.

00:49:24.659--> 00:49:26.211
I have nothing more to keep.

00:49:26.291--> 00:49:27.451
Nothing more to keep?
- No.

00:49:27.531--> 00:49:28.611
Alright.

00:49:29.168--> 00:49:30.704
What are you doing?

00:49:30.784--> 00:49:32.464
Don't worry, I'll arrange it back for you.

00:49:32.531--> 00:49:33.611
I can't do it again.

00:49:33.691--> 00:49:40.985
I'll do it, don't fret.
I'll arrange it. I'll put this first.

00:49:49.784--> 00:49:53.643
Oh dear, this isn't shutting!
What happened?

00:49:57.071--> 00:50:01.031
This is enough. Where is my towel?

00:50:02.876--> 00:50:04.071
Oh, it's around my waist.

00:50:04.963--> 00:50:07.391
Sister, you'll receive a letter.

00:50:07.579--> 00:50:11.271
The train that moves west exactly
at 11 o'clock, that will be my train.

00:50:11.471--> 00:50:13.911
We change trains at
Ranaghat and go to Goland.

00:50:14.812--> 00:50:16.151
I'll proceed. Oh.

00:50:19.114--> 00:50:20.191
I'll see you!

00:50:34.670--> 00:50:36.871
Wife, why did you allow him to leave?

00:50:39.968--> 00:50:44.951
What is the point in stopping
one who was never mine?

00:51:35.545--> 00:51:39.620
You might fall!
- It's fine, don't worry!

00:52:13.044--> 00:52:16.044
Daughter-in-law! Come, time to eat.

00:52:20.988--> 00:52:24.447
See this. Father has sent this for our son.
- Really?

00:52:24.682--> 00:52:25.409
Yes.

00:52:25.489--> 00:52:28.447
We're back.
- What are these, sister-in-law?

00:52:28.527--> 00:52:30.002
Sonny's clothes.
- Oh!

00:52:30.082--> 00:52:32.282
Father-in-law sent these.
- For our Sonny? - Yes.

00:52:32.362--> 00:52:38.068
Wow, it shines so! A nice shiny necklace.

00:52:38.446--> 00:52:42.162
Sister-in-law, tomorrow sonny will wear
all this and go out with me for a stroll.

00:52:42.866--> 00:52:45.083
Looks like you won't go to court tomorrow.

00:52:45.163--> 00:52:48.602
Why won't I go to the court?
But do release me at 3.

00:52:48.762--> 00:52:49.922
3 o'clock?
- Yes.

00:52:51.222--> 00:52:52.282
Come.

00:53:09.914--> 00:53:11.568
Its 3 already.
- Go home.

00:53:46.127--> 00:53:48.402
Charan, a flower.
- What?

00:53:48.482--> 00:53:50.767
A flower over there.

00:53:51.364--> 00:53:53.710
See, how that bird flies!

00:53:53.790--> 00:53:56.950
Look over there, see how the bird flies.
- No, I want a flower. I want a flower.

00:53:56.979--> 00:54:00.794
Look! They're fishing!
- No, flower! See how they fish!

00:54:01.043--> 00:54:02.207
No, I want a flower.

00:54:03.127--> 00:54:04.207
You want a flower?

00:54:04.935--> 00:54:08.167
Fine, you sit here.
I'll get you a flower. Okay?

00:54:08.247--> 00:54:10.589
Don't go anywhere. Okay!

00:55:44.615--> 00:55:48.775
Sonny! Sonny!

00:56:00.242--> 00:56:01.355
Sonny!

00:56:11.809--> 00:56:13.160
Sonny!

00:56:23.063--> 00:56:24.555
Sonny!

00:56:33.939--> 00:56:35.874
Sonny!

00:56:37.624--> 00:56:40.154
Sonny!

00:57:20.437--> 00:57:21.724
Sonny!

00:57:29.172--> 00:57:30.455
Sonny!

00:57:43.129--> 00:57:44.695
Sonny!

00:57:50.351--> 00:57:52.695
Sonny!

00:57:54.913--> 00:57:56.535
Sonny.

00:58:07.367--> 00:58:10.902
Have you seen Sonny?
- No.

00:58:12.027--> 00:58:13.215
You haven't?

00:58:23.713--> 00:58:25.455
Sonny!

00:58:31.055--> 00:58:32.935
Sonny!

00:58:37.053--> 00:58:38.935
Sonny!

00:58:42.372--> 00:58:44.615
Sonny!

00:58:49.215--> 00:58:50.855
Sonny!

00:58:52.855--> 00:58:54.615
Sonny!

00:58:56.501--> 00:58:58.535
Sonny!

00:59:05.442--> 00:59:06.922
You haven't seen your son.

00:59:07.366--> 00:59:08.886
He looks so nice with the necklace on.

00:59:09.701--> 00:59:10.842
Sir!
- Who's there?

00:59:11.430--> 00:59:14.208
Sir, has your little boy returned home?
- No.

00:59:14.587--> 00:59:17.082
Your servant is weeping.
He can't find the boy.

00:59:18.219--> 00:59:21.362
What?
- We're ruined! Where is Sonny?

00:59:21.917--> 00:59:22.923
Come let's see.

00:59:23.874--> 00:59:25.560
Sonny!

00:59:25.993--> 00:59:27.869
Don't be impatient!

00:59:27.949--> 00:59:30.189
No, I've a feeling something is wrong.

00:59:30.269--> 00:59:32.069
Nothing is wrong.
- Something is surely wrong.

00:59:32.109--> 00:59:33.269
Sonny!
- Sonny!

00:59:33.349--> 00:59:35.365
Sonny!
- Sonny!

00:59:36.109--> 00:59:39.269
Sonny! Sonny!

00:59:39.538--> 00:59:43.589
Sonny!
- Sonny! Sonny, Sonny!

00:59:44.706--> 00:59:45.869
Sonny.

00:59:46.057--> 00:59:49.589
Raicharan, where is my son? My son?

00:59:49.789--> 00:59:51.429
Why are you silent, tell me?!

00:59:51.798--> 00:59:52.949
Where is my son?

00:59:53.603--> 00:59:55.789
Raicharan, where is my son?

00:59:56.078--> 00:59:59.349
Say something.

00:59:59.938--> 01:00:01.189
I don't know, sister-in-law.

01:00:01.349--> 01:00:02.565
What do you mean, you don't know?

01:00:02.589--> 01:00:04.005
You took him along with you for a stroll.

01:00:04.029--> 01:00:06.789
Sister-in-law, I don't know!
I don't know, I don't know!

01:00:08.231--> 01:00:12.109
You don't know! Why did you take him?

01:00:12.189--> 01:00:15.940
Get my son back, get him back.

01:00:16.188--> 01:00:18.709
Give me my son back!

01:00:18.988--> 01:00:21.351
What are you saying..
- Give me my son back!

01:00:21.431--> 01:00:22.966
What are you saying, sister-in-law?

01:00:23.323--> 01:00:26.189
My son, my..

01:00:29.941--> 01:00:33.819
You're wrong.
You're wrong to suspect Raicharan.

01:00:33.899--> 01:00:36.341
No, I'm not wrong.

01:00:36.421--> 01:00:38.581
Look, think over it carefully.

01:00:38.661--> 01:00:41.501
Why would Raicharan commit
a heinous crime like this?

01:00:41.581--> 01:00:44.685
Why not? Wasn't Sonny
wearing gold ornaments?

01:00:44.858--> 01:00:46.661
No, no. Don't talk like this!

01:00:46.934--> 01:00:52.101
Had he done it,
why would he leave the pram back?

01:00:52.181--> 01:00:56.501
That's a ruse. Throw him out! Fire him!

01:00:59.301--> 01:01:01.581
Very well, I'll do it.

01:01:02.102--> 01:01:04.261
Raicharan, Raicharan.

01:01:04.729--> 01:01:06.821
Raicharan, Raicharan.

01:01:07.821--> 01:01:08.941
Raicha..

01:01:40.037--> 01:01:42.978
Who's that? Raicharan, isn't it?

01:01:57.264--> 01:01:59.904
Charan, what happened?

01:02:00.427--> 01:02:05.344
Sonny is no more, he is no more.
- What happened?

01:02:07.422--> 01:02:09.508
Do you know what sister-in-law said?

01:02:11.000--> 01:02:14.680
Can we get the child back
whatever amount of money we give?

01:02:16.680--> 01:02:20.840
That is the problem.
I can bear everything.

01:02:22.120--> 01:02:26.000
Only if I could get him back.

01:02:31.760--> 01:02:36.992
Wife, is he still alive?
- May be he is.

01:02:38.159--> 01:02:40.200
What did you say?
- May be he is.

01:02:42.970--> 01:02:46.200
So you're saying he didn't drown?
- I don't think so.

01:02:48.354--> 01:02:53.600
May you be right! May you be right!

01:03:04.264--> 01:03:08.584
Wife, it seems you said the child is alive.
- Yes.

01:03:08.927--> 01:03:12.784
What a problem you've created! He left.
- Where?

01:03:13.014--> 01:03:16.424
Back to the same place.
He won't return till he finds him.

01:03:58.712--> 01:04:04.874
Excuse me! This way.

01:04:06.401--> 01:04:09.641
You're back! Don't you recognise me?

01:04:10.127--> 01:04:12.561
Did you go to that house? How would you?

01:04:12.992--> 01:04:15.801
I work there now.
Where have you kept Sonny?

01:04:18.063--> 01:04:19.881
Sonny, Sonny! Where is Sonny?

01:04:19.961--> 01:04:24.801
He is alive, he is there.
He is there. He is alive.

01:04:25.305--> 01:04:33.201
Somebody has hidden him.
Somebody has hidden him.

01:04:52.560--> 01:04:57.609
Jodu said, he saw Raicharan by the river.

01:04:58.733--> 01:05:03.793
He seems to have gone mad.
He says Sonny is alive.

01:05:04.688--> 01:05:07.688
Oh, so he is on that track.

01:05:08.820--> 01:05:12.488
I'm sure, he has hidden Sonny somewhere.

01:05:13.928--> 01:05:15.928
He will sell off those ornaments.

01:05:16.568--> 01:05:21.408
Listen to me carefully.
Raicharan has likely gone mad.

01:05:22.333--> 01:05:25.008
He says Sonny is alive.

01:05:26.554--> 01:05:30.114
Wife, I believe you're going
to look for him? - Yes.

01:05:30.409--> 01:05:33.554
I think he might take up the job again.

01:05:33.714--> 01:05:35.714
But he doesn't belong there.

01:05:35.933--> 01:05:38.714
Why not? They didn't fire him.

01:05:38.906--> 01:05:40.474
They only accused him.

01:05:40.733--> 01:05:43.394
I want to see him once.

01:05:44.634--> 01:05:48.114
He has told us,
he won't return unless he finds Sonny.

01:05:48.300--> 01:05:53.234
I want to go and see him for myself.
He won't come.

01:05:53.749--> 01:05:57.034
You're a lady.
You'll travel to an unknown place?

01:05:57.209--> 01:05:59.474
So much inconvenience.
- Never mind.

01:06:12.662--> 01:06:16.502
I had asked you to file
a complaint with the police.

01:06:16.582--> 01:06:17.662
Did you do it?

01:06:17.891--> 01:06:21.342
Against whom?
- Raicharan.

01:06:23.502--> 01:06:26.142
He is roaming around like a madman.

01:06:26.789--> 01:06:28.502
You don't know it for a fact.

01:06:29.196--> 01:06:32.876
We've come from Kaldonga.

01:06:34.778--> 01:06:37.454
She is Raicharan's wife.
I'm her companion.

01:06:47.454--> 01:06:52.534
Ma'am, you can keep him.
I only want to see him once.

01:06:53.449--> 01:06:57.614
Oh. Husband and wife
have planned it all, is it?

01:06:58.694--> 01:07:00.534
I hear he is hiding somewhere here.

01:07:01.294--> 01:07:03.454
He hasn't come here even once to meet us.

01:07:04.294--> 01:07:08.454
And now you've come to say
that you don't know where he is.

01:07:09.520--> 01:07:14.277
Is your jewellery made from his ornaments?

01:07:14.454--> 01:07:15.854
Ma'am, what are you saying?

01:07:17.174--> 01:07:19.934
Actually, I should hand
you over to the police too.

01:07:21.088--> 01:07:22.299
Have you gone mad?

01:07:22.379--> 01:07:26.255
Ma'am, I think mad Raicharan has drowned.
- What?

01:07:26.335--> 01:07:28.454
Yes. A dead body was flowing in the river.

01:07:28.676--> 01:07:30.471
From the description I heard,
it must be him.

01:07:30.551--> 01:07:31.672
Have you seen it with your own eyes?

01:07:31.696--> 01:07:33.934
No. Before I could even reach,
they burnt the body.

01:07:34.774--> 01:07:41.854
It was a young man, quite good looking.
Seems like him.

01:07:42.125--> 01:07:46.294
No. It's not him. It's someone else.

01:07:48.081--> 01:07:49.854
Get water, quickly.

01:08:16.504--> 01:08:18.826
Does the river take in everything?

01:08:18.906--> 01:08:22.091
Says who? I just found
a little shoe in the net.

01:08:22.171--> 01:08:23.784
Some little boy must have drowned.

01:08:23.864--> 01:08:25.104
Will you show me the shoe?

01:08:25.624--> 01:08:26.704
Here it is.

01:08:48.532--> 01:08:51.852
Who's there? Daughter-in-law!

01:08:52.252--> 01:08:54.612
What is the matter, dear?

01:08:54.772--> 01:08:59.012
Sister, why didn't I
listen to you and stay back?

01:08:59.237--> 01:09:01.092
Why did I go? Why?

01:09:01.252--> 01:09:04.532
It was a crowded place.
There they found the body..

01:09:04.612--> 01:09:07.692
Of someone who drowned.
It seems that he resembled Raicharan.

01:09:07.772--> 01:09:11.532
Drowned? No, it's impossible. Never!

01:09:11.612--> 01:09:14.012
She became unconscious
and the doctor was called.

01:09:14.252--> 01:09:16.772
He examined and said she is expecting.

01:09:17.092--> 01:09:18.332
Hope that is true.

01:09:20.535--> 01:09:21.988
Where are you going, daughter-in-law?

01:09:22.012--> 01:09:25.612
Sister, what can I do?
I can't live in this house any more.

01:09:26.332--> 01:09:28.772
Let me go. Let me go.

01:09:48.772--> 01:09:53.172
You've come back! You're back!

01:09:53.412--> 01:09:55.012
You were wrong, wife.

01:09:55.216--> 01:09:56.612
You're back.

01:09:58.546--> 01:09:59.995
You were wrong.

01:10:02.908--> 01:10:06.748
Charan, listen to me carefully.

01:10:07.828--> 01:10:09.428
Daughter-in-law is expecting.

01:10:13.908--> 01:10:21.908
No, no! I won't let
anyone take Sonny's place.

01:10:23.106--> 01:10:29.312
Don't be silly!
Quiet! Don't make her suffer any more.

01:10:29.392--> 01:10:33.068
No, sister, no!
The child to come is my enemy.

01:10:33.428--> 01:10:35.582
It's my enemy.

01:11:04.622--> 01:11:09.622
Raicharan! Raicharan! Come home, quick!

01:11:13.562--> 01:11:15.302
Don't be silly! Come home!

01:11:28.794--> 01:11:32.222
I've sent for him.
He'll be here any moment.

01:11:42.966--> 01:11:44.946
Charan!
- I heard.

01:11:45.026--> 01:11:46.466
I heard that doomed cry!

01:11:46.793--> 01:11:49.626
No! It was a difficult delivery.

01:11:49.706--> 01:11:52.626
She isn't too well. Come and see her.

01:11:53.766--> 01:11:56.466
Come, don't delay. Come.

01:12:07.995--> 01:12:09.075
Where are you going?

01:12:09.692--> 01:12:10.835
Listen.

01:12:15.519--> 01:12:19.075
Go, sit by your wife.

01:12:39.054--> 01:12:41.482
Come close to me.

01:12:45.097--> 01:12:47.395
I won't bother you anymore.

01:12:50.599--> 01:12:52.902
I'm going.

01:12:53.965--> 01:12:59.405
But, but, take care of Sonny.

01:13:10.245--> 01:13:14.405
Where are you? Where are you?

01:13:15.325--> 01:13:17.725
Daughter-in-law!
- I'm here, here I am!

01:14:06.030--> 01:14:10.598
He is crying. What's that sound?
- Who will look after him?

01:14:10.678--> 01:14:12.393
I've to do the housework too.

01:14:12.473--> 01:14:13.965
His father is here.

01:14:14.159--> 01:14:16.993
Raicharan? It's my bad luck.

01:14:17.073--> 01:14:18.993
He calls him his enemy.

01:14:19.073--> 01:14:22.553
Says he is the one
who drove his Sonny away.

01:14:25.881--> 01:14:28.041
Wait, wait, Phaelna! You'll fall!

01:14:29.121--> 01:14:31.601
Sister, what have you
named your dear nephew?

01:14:31.942--> 01:14:32.961
Phaelna.

01:14:33.769--> 01:14:34.769
Phaelna?

01:14:35.380--> 01:14:39.281
So what? Have you ever
looked at him properly?

01:14:39.543--> 01:14:40.761
Have you even carried him in your arms?

01:14:40.785--> 01:14:42.385
All you can do is call him your 'enemy.'

01:14:42.580--> 01:14:45.693
I feel scared.
If I leave him alone and go somewhere..

01:14:45.866--> 01:14:47.201
You might even kill him.

01:14:49.348--> 01:14:50.601
What a thing to say!

01:14:54.305--> 01:14:55.577
Who?

01:14:59.127--> 01:15:01.388
Who called out?
- Your son.

01:15:12.737--> 01:15:13.988
What did he say?

01:15:14.489--> 01:15:16.388
He called me aunt.

01:15:18.489--> 01:15:20.468
Aunt?
- Yes.

01:15:21.170--> 01:15:22.548
Make him say it one more time.

01:15:23.308--> 01:15:25.628
Phaelna, who am I?
- Aunt.

01:15:25.819--> 01:15:29.451
Sister, this boy will be a judge.

01:15:29.531--> 01:15:30.828
Sure, he will!

01:15:30.908--> 01:15:31.908
How come?

01:15:31.963--> 01:15:34.478
Does everyone have to be
illiterate like you all their lives?

01:15:34.558--> 01:15:37.988
No, it's not that.
Look at him. Look at him.

01:15:38.068--> 01:15:42.228
Look at him. He looks just like Sonny.

01:15:44.153--> 01:15:47.548
That may be so. You loved him a lot.

01:15:47.988--> 01:15:50.272
May be he came back to you.

01:15:50.352--> 01:15:52.388
They do come back, isn't it, sister?
- Of course!

01:15:52.468--> 01:15:54.218
He too used to say 'aunt' just like this.

01:15:54.298--> 01:15:58.708
Even.. sister,
don't talk ill about master's wife.

01:15:58.931--> 01:16:03.623
She was right, I did steal her son.
I stole him.

01:16:03.703--> 01:16:08.174
Very well.
Now how about bringing him up well?

01:16:08.254--> 01:16:11.828
Yes, I will. Certainly.

01:16:12.068--> 01:16:13.788
I'll bring him up like
a proper human being.

01:16:13.936--> 01:16:16.828
Sister, it's okay if he calls you aunt.

01:16:16.908--> 01:16:18.908
But let him not address me as 'daddy.'

01:16:18.988--> 01:16:21.388
What should he call you?
- Let him call me Charan.

01:16:21.569--> 01:16:24.628
Tell him, tell him to call me Charan.

01:16:25.386--> 01:16:28.228
Very well. I'll instruct him likewise.

01:16:29.908--> 01:16:32.828
It's just as well wife died.
Were she alive, she'd teach..

01:16:32.908--> 01:16:34.283
Him to call her 'mom.'

01:16:34.640--> 01:16:39.908
But why is Sonny in this state?

01:16:40.552--> 01:16:43.991
No, he won't be in this state.
- What?

01:16:44.071--> 01:16:46.228
I'll be back right away.

01:16:49.612--> 01:16:52.148
Where are you going?
- Did you say something?

01:16:52.369--> 01:16:55.988
To get nice things for Sonny.

01:17:08.828--> 01:17:10.828
Finally, he got drawn to his son?

01:17:11.136--> 01:17:14.308
Didn't I say no one can ignore a child?

01:17:14.988--> 01:17:17.708
He is drawn to him, do you know why?

01:17:18.628--> 01:17:23.468
Suddenly he feels that
his son is his lost Sonny.

01:17:23.726--> 01:17:24.947
How nice he looks!

01:17:26.152--> 01:17:30.832
Just like my sonny. Wait.

01:17:35.045--> 01:17:37.391
Where are you going again?
- I'll be back.

01:17:37.677--> 01:17:42.547
Hey goldsmith!
Can you melt these and make some..

01:17:42.742--> 01:17:44.796
Small bracelets, rings and necklace?

01:17:49.186--> 01:17:50.643
How nice he looks!

01:17:50.723--> 01:17:51.800
Let me see.

01:17:53.432--> 01:17:54.520
Where did you get the gold?

01:17:54.934--> 01:17:57.313
Wife's ornaments. I sold them.

01:17:58.772--> 01:18:00.880
Wonderful!

01:18:39.784--> 01:18:40.944
Sonny!

01:18:42.364--> 01:18:49.846
Are these for me?
Give me, give those to me. Charan!

01:18:50.062--> 01:18:53.864
Listen, don't play with them.

01:18:54.408--> 01:18:57.067
Whom do I play with?
- With me.

01:18:57.628--> 01:19:01.028
Wow! You play well!

01:19:02.948--> 01:19:08.028
Here, hit this. Very good, good shot!

01:19:09.598--> 01:19:14.028
Charan, Charan!
- Yes. Come here. What?

01:19:14.236--> 01:19:17.308
You've decided to make him a judge.

01:19:17.388--> 01:19:18.468
Yes, I must.

01:19:18.548--> 01:19:20.308
Will he become one
only by playing all day?

01:19:20.884--> 01:19:22.124
What are you trying to tell me?

01:19:22.387--> 01:19:23.948
Doesn't he need to study?

01:19:24.895--> 01:19:30.108
Yes sister, you're right.
We've to put him in a school.

01:19:30.548--> 01:19:31.548
You must.

01:19:34.937--> 01:19:36.039
Two times two is four.

01:19:36.119--> 01:19:37.650
Two times two is four.

01:19:37.730--> 01:19:40.868
Master, you dropped that.
- Hey!

01:19:41.780--> 01:19:43.207
1 quarter is one fourth.

01:19:43.287--> 01:19:44.887
1 quarter is one fourth.

01:19:44.967--> 01:19:46.367
2 quarters is one half.

01:19:46.447--> 01:19:47.887
2 quarters is one half.

01:19:47.967--> 01:19:49.367
3 quarters is three fourth.

01:19:49.447--> 01:19:51.127
3 quarters is three fourth.

01:19:51.207--> 01:19:52.607
4 quarters is one whole.

01:19:52.687--> 01:19:54.207
4 quarters is one whole.

01:19:54.287--> 01:19:58.047
5 quarters is one and one fourth.
- 5 quarters is one and one fourth.

01:19:58.127--> 01:20:01.607
6 quarters is one and half.
- 6 quarters is one and half.

01:20:01.687--> 01:20:03.444
7 quarters is one and three fourths.

01:20:03.640--> 01:20:07.640
No sister,
sonny can't study in that school.

01:20:09.315--> 01:20:13.080
I spoke to Palli Ghosh.
He'll come home and teach him.

01:20:13.769--> 01:20:17.640
However, we've to pay him a little more.

01:20:18.667--> 01:20:19.880
That's for sure.

01:20:21.880--> 01:20:26.000
But see, only our crops are not enough.

01:20:26.800--> 01:20:28.800
You've to look for some work.

01:20:29.880--> 01:20:31.640
Haven't I considered that?

01:20:34.895--> 01:20:40.074
You've to do all the work.
Like buying goods.

01:20:40.323--> 01:20:43.360
Cleaning the store twice a day.
You'll get one meal a day.

01:20:43.440--> 01:20:44.333
Yes, sir.

01:20:44.413--> 01:20:47.963
You see that store room?
You can stay there.

01:20:48.803--> 01:20:50.484
How many family members are you?

01:20:50.564--> 01:20:53.403
We're three members.
That one and the two of us.

01:20:53.819--> 01:20:57.739
This is our land,
why are you measuring it?

01:20:57.952--> 01:21:00.299
It used to be yours, no more.
- Meaning?

01:21:00.665--> 01:21:01.979
Ask your brother.

01:21:04.286--> 01:21:06.619
Hey! Go up to that corner.

01:21:12.134--> 01:21:14.739
Why are you quiet? Read on.

01:21:15.681--> 01:21:17.379
K.
- K.

01:21:18.222--> 01:21:19.819
Kh.
- Kh.

01:21:20.139--> 01:21:24.514
G - G.
- How much Khokababu has studied?

01:21:24.594--> 01:21:29.819
Maybe one page.
- When? - After he finishes the page.

01:21:29.899--> 01:21:31.219
I don't understand all that.

01:21:31.379--> 01:21:32.739
Count it and tell me.

01:21:32.819--> 01:21:34.819
It's done. Look at this.

01:21:35.001--> 01:21:40.157
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 pages.
- What?

01:21:40.816--> 01:21:43.314
He learnt all of it?
- Yes. He is a fine lad.

01:21:44.903--> 01:21:46.619
I told you he'll be a judge.

01:21:48.091--> 01:21:55.395
But of course. What have you
done with the land next to the pond?

01:21:57.147--> 01:22:00.739
Sister, now that Sonny
has come to our house..

01:22:01.180--> 01:22:03.139
I won't let him want for anything.

01:22:07.461--> 01:22:08.979
I sold that land.

01:22:11.299--> 01:22:12.899
Does anyone sell off land?

01:22:18.739--> 01:22:21.459
Sister! Sister!

01:22:21.916--> 01:22:23.059
What happened?

01:22:28.881--> 01:22:30.021
What is it, Raicharan?

01:22:30.101--> 01:22:31.999
You seem a bit preoccupied today.

01:22:32.159--> 01:22:36.239
Yes. Sister is quite sick.
- Oh.

01:22:36.319--> 01:22:38.079
How long should I keep waiting?

01:22:38.334--> 01:22:39.615
Quick, give me some roasted lentils.

01:22:39.639--> 01:22:41.559
Raicharan! Raicharan!
- Yes.

01:22:41.639--> 01:22:44.907
Come home, quick! Your sister!
Quick, come! What happened?

01:23:09.995--> 01:23:13.715
Who's there?
- It's me.

01:23:14.835--> 01:23:15.915
I'm Charan.

01:23:21.915--> 01:23:28.635
The boy, we've to bring up the boy well.

01:23:28.715--> 01:23:30.235
We will, sister, we will.

01:23:31.400--> 01:23:34.426
Listen.

01:23:36.577--> 01:23:41.155
Listen, you do one more..

01:24:21.915--> 01:24:24.315
Here, its rupees 18.75.

01:25:07.634--> 01:25:10.274
Hey, you're going to play football.
Why the make up?

01:25:11.105--> 01:25:12.874
I can't just go anyhow.

01:25:13.473--> 01:25:16.434
How much longer?
- I'm done.

01:25:22.068--> 01:25:23.114
Come.

01:25:25.224--> 01:25:27.267
Hey, wait!

01:25:30.017--> 01:25:31.137
What do you have?

01:25:31.819--> 01:25:33.862
Whatever is here is all for you.

01:25:34.175--> 01:25:37.017
What is this?
- This? It's mango candy.

01:25:37.217--> 01:25:38.297
Here.

01:25:38.474--> 01:25:44.584
Hey! I didn't get this month's rent.
- I'll give you.

01:25:44.784--> 01:25:50.425
Give it, when?
If you don't pay me the rent in a week..

01:25:50.505--> 01:25:54.024
You'll have to vacate the house.
Don't forget!

01:26:13.729--> 01:26:17.249
Take, this is your pocket money.

01:26:19.569--> 01:26:21.889
I want a woolen outfit.

01:26:23.115--> 01:26:25.351
Roasted peas!

01:26:25.635--> 01:26:31.708
Give me 1 paisa worth of those.
- Here you go.

01:26:32.530--> 01:26:35.635
Roasted dry peas!
- Give me some, brother.

01:26:40.259--> 01:26:42.795
Roasted dry peas!

01:26:57.588--> 01:27:00.259
Take the money.

01:27:01.502--> 01:27:02.904
Come on, Sonny.

01:27:11.433--> 01:27:12.753
Let me have a look.

01:27:16.637--> 01:27:18.172
I'll go now.
- Okay.

01:27:21.689--> 01:27:26.489
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't paid 3 months' fees.

01:27:29.929--> 01:27:31.489
Yes, I know.

01:27:32.183--> 01:27:36.489
I can't face anyone. Please pay it soon.

01:28:00.895--> 01:28:06.010
If I'm not going to live
here where's the harm selling it?

01:28:06.193--> 01:28:09.255
Very good. In that case.
- Here you're Raicharan!

01:28:14.842--> 01:28:18.015
I heard you're back so I came to see you.
- Come.

01:28:19.220--> 01:28:20.220
Can you recognise him?

01:28:26.561--> 01:28:28.895
Your son used to play
with him at one time.

01:28:29.566--> 01:28:30.735
My son, Noren.

01:28:33.177--> 01:28:35.815
I hear you've kept your son
at a boarding school in Kolkata.

01:28:38.994--> 01:28:45.335
Yes. Sister is no more
so I had to keep him.

01:28:45.728--> 01:28:48.415
Good. I'm taking him to Kolkata too.

01:28:48.582--> 01:28:49.942
I'll put him in a boarding school.

01:28:59.015--> 01:29:03.415
It's good. But quite expensive.

01:29:03.495--> 01:29:05.632
My employer is giving the money.

01:29:05.859--> 01:29:07.415
That is why he can stay in a boarding.

01:29:07.653--> 01:29:09.335
I wanted to tell you something.

01:29:09.567--> 01:29:12.015
There is something called
divine intervention, you know.

01:29:12.475--> 01:29:13.575
What do you mean?

01:29:14.107--> 01:29:16.471
Your master's wife accused
you of being a thief and fired you.

01:29:16.495--> 01:29:19.735
Now they've returned
to their Barasat home.

01:29:21.575--> 01:29:23.095
How did you know of it?

01:29:23.686--> 01:29:26.495
My relative, Bhola, works at their place.

01:29:26.994--> 01:29:31.095
Your master's mom wants
to get him married again.

01:29:34.940--> 01:29:36.415
Get him married again?

01:29:36.495--> 01:29:38.895
Yes. What else can they do?
They don't have any kids.

01:29:39.015--> 01:29:40.535
They need to continue their bloodline.

01:29:40.789--> 01:29:42.638
I'll leave now. I'm in a rush.

01:29:42.718--> 01:29:45.735
Come on, let's go.
We need to arrange things.

01:29:46.475--> 01:29:48.655
Master will get married again?

01:29:52.486--> 01:29:54.175
Continue the bloodline.

01:29:58.930--> 01:30:00.575
Continue the bloodline..

01:30:03.664--> 01:30:09.276
Hey, fix the price!
200, 225! Where are you going?

01:30:09.474--> 01:30:12.443
No. Mom has spoken about your marriage.

01:30:12.523--> 01:30:14.354
No, mom hasn't said that.

01:30:14.634--> 01:30:16.794
Mom was talking about
continuing the bloodline.

01:30:17.070--> 01:30:18.954
Why would she talk only about that?

01:30:19.319--> 01:30:22.479
She said when nothing has resulted despite
taking treatment for 6 months, then..

01:30:22.505--> 01:30:24.354
Sir.
- Who?

01:30:26.804--> 01:30:29.020
I'm, I'm Raicharan.

01:30:29.225--> 01:30:30.554
What do you want?

01:30:36.613--> 01:30:40.246
I came to pay you my obeisance.
To bow to you.

01:30:40.521--> 01:30:43.441
Obeisance? You've come back?

01:30:43.889--> 01:30:45.097
You aren't satisfied even after..

01:30:45.121--> 01:30:47.257
Taking everything away from me?
- What are you doing?

01:30:47.281--> 01:30:50.521
What am I doing?
Today, I'm almost bereft of everything.

01:30:50.991--> 01:30:53.361
I stand to lose everything that I have,
only because of him.

01:30:53.586--> 01:30:57.521
He is the one..
- Sister-in-law! You were right.

01:30:57.841--> 01:31:03.121
The river didn't steal your son,
I did. I did.

01:31:03.201--> 01:31:06.601
Raicharan!
- Yes. Where is he? Where is he?

01:31:06.862--> 01:31:08.635
Do you want to see him?
- Yes.

01:31:08.715--> 01:31:10.365
No, never! Never!

01:31:10.862--> 01:31:16.246
That boy from your village says so.
Noren! There he is!

01:31:16.470--> 01:31:17.870
No, never, never!

01:31:17.950--> 01:31:20.230
Are you ashamed to
call your father a father?

01:31:20.310--> 01:31:21.710
No, no, Charan is not my father.

01:31:21.790--> 01:31:23.870
Charan is not my father. There he is!

01:31:25.467--> 01:31:28.040
What is this? What is this Noren saying?
- What?

01:31:28.245--> 01:31:29.870
He says you're my father.

01:31:31.921--> 01:31:34.230
You told me you're not my father.

01:31:44.959--> 01:31:49.283
Yes. Whatever I told you is true.

01:31:50.970--> 01:31:52.390
It's all true.

01:31:54.008--> 01:31:58.991
Sonny, I'm not your father.
I'm not your father.

01:31:59.071--> 01:32:02.710
My Sonny, my Sonny!
- Here you are, ma'am.

01:32:11.365--> 01:32:15.125
Sonny! My sonny! My Sonny!

01:32:17.553--> 01:32:19.045
My Sonny!

01:32:19.645--> 01:32:21.369
Let me see, let me see!

01:32:21.449--> 01:32:24.045
My Sonny! My Sonny!

01:32:24.565--> 01:32:28.365
Touch her feet, she is your mom.

01:32:31.217--> 01:32:32.365
My Sonny!

01:32:40.313--> 01:32:41.393
Halt!

01:33:46.236--> 01:33:50.592
Master, do you remember?

01:33:52.072--> 01:33:54.152
So much has happened in this room!

01:33:56.150--> 01:34:01.752
Remember in childhood,
you used to sit there and study.

01:34:03.037--> 01:34:05.232
I used to sit here and doze.

01:34:09.512--> 01:34:12.874
Then you grew up and got married.

01:34:12.954--> 01:34:16.152
Raicharan, you can't stay here.

01:34:26.592--> 01:34:28.512
Where will I stay?

01:34:29.992--> 01:34:31.832
What are you saying?

01:34:33.752--> 01:34:37.967
He has admitted to his crime,
he has even returned Sonny to us.

01:34:38.184--> 01:34:40.152
We can't punish him now.

01:34:40.392--> 01:34:43.592
I believed that he was
never guilty of that crime.

01:34:44.076--> 01:34:46.563
Now that he has admitted to his misdeed..

01:34:46.996--> 01:34:48.912
He must face the consequences.

01:34:49.152--> 01:34:50.232
Don't say that.

01:34:50.592--> 01:34:52.392
It might affect my
Sonny in a negative manner.

01:34:53.050--> 01:34:54.992
Please forgive him.

01:34:55.592--> 01:34:58.152
I can't forgive him for what he has done.

01:34:58.232--> 01:35:02.592
I didn't do it, I didn't!
I didn't do it, ma'am, I didn't.

01:35:02.672--> 01:35:06.592
I didn't do it, I didn't do it!
It was fate.

01:35:07.072--> 01:35:11.312
One who can betray you so
badly doesn't deserve to be trusted.

01:35:11.392--> 01:35:16.512
But master, it is not me.
- Then who was it?

01:35:18.447--> 01:35:20.166
My waywardness.

01:35:20.246--> 01:35:22.752
Look, I can't keep you.

01:35:23.512--> 01:35:26.752
Keeping you here is a sin!

01:35:35.485--> 01:35:41.832
Sin? Keeping me is a sin?

01:35:43.485--> 01:35:48.134
Father, forgive him.
Ask him to leave the house.

01:35:48.350--> 01:35:50.210
But absolve him of his crime.

01:36:41.264--> 01:36:47.544
I have committed a misdeed.
I deserve punishment.

01:36:50.796--> 01:36:55.802
I have committed a misdeed.
I deserve punishment.

01:36:57.640--> 01:37:04.544
No, no. No! Raicharan! Raicharan.
- Stop.

01:37:05.104--> 01:37:08.624
Don't call him back. Let him go.

01:38:24.263--> 01:38:26.383
There is a money order
for Raicharan Dutta.

01:38:26.659--> 01:38:30.129
Hey Raicharan Dutta!

01:38:36.301--> 01:38:40.741
Sonny was saying you sent Raicharan money.

01:38:41.501--> 01:38:44.681
Yes. From now on,
Raicharan will get double..

01:38:45.275--> 01:38:47.901
The amount of money he
used to get when he worked here.

01:38:48.141--> 01:38:50.421
I've money ordered the amount.

01:38:50.501--> 01:38:53.661
No, no! Money is not everything.

01:38:53.901--> 01:38:55.981
Get him back any way you can.

01:38:56.184--> 01:38:59.330
What if some misfortune befalls my Sonny?

01:38:59.410--> 01:39:02.061
Master, master, the peon is calling you.

01:39:09.661--> 01:39:13.581
Sir, there is no one at Raicharan's
address, where you had sent money.

01:39:14.420--> 01:39:15.869
Raicharan is not there?

01:39:15.949--> 01:39:17.821
No sir. The money has come back.

01:39:48.014--> 01:39:49.094
'What work do you know?'

01:39:49.382--> 01:39:51.814
'I can run on one foot,
I can play kabaddi.'

01:39:52.171--> 01:39:55.734
'I've such good aim I can
hit what I want with my slingshot.'

01:39:57.196--> 01:39:59.934
'I can climb this tree. Can you?'

01:40:01.314--> 01:40:02.934
'No.'
- 'Look at this.'

01:40:11.334--> 01:40:12.814
'Take.'
- 'No.'

01:40:12.894--> 01:40:16.414
'Your master's orders. Drink up!'
- 'Okay.'

01:40:17.671--> 01:40:22.309
Daddy, daddy!
