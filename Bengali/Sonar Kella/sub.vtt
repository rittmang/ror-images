00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:31.481
Listen! Are you listening?

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.592
Once again!

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:39.661
Alas! What is wrong with our child?

00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:43.134
He's doesn't sleep or smile anymore.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:56.959
Mukul! Aren't you
going to sleep tonight?

00:01:57.708 --> 00:02:00.021
Everyone is sleeping. Won't you?

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.468
I'm drawing.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.919
Okay, do it in the morning.
You'll catch a cold now.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.492
Mukul!

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:19.378
This is a peacock.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.254
I have seen a peacock before.

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:26.240
This is a camel.
We used to have camels at our house.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.660
This is my house.
I am standing in front of my house.

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:39.108
This is the picture of a war.
I have seen that war.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.052
And this is the fortress.
The Golden Fortress.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:46.950
Alright, when did you
first notice this problem?

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.014
It has been two or three months.

00:04:50.505 --> 00:04:54.311
Did you notice if this occurs
at a specific time?

00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:57.423
He is absent minded
almost all the time.

00:04:57.792 --> 00:04:59.982
His mind is always somewhere else.

00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:03.835
I can't send him to school.
His mind is never on his studies.

00:05:04.322 --> 00:05:06.026
He's always thinking
and drawing pictures.

00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:10.097
He always claims those pictures
are of the place, where he was born.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.554
Have you seen those?

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:17.354
The forts, mountains
and camels you speak about?

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:19.294
I used to live there.

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:21.822
Do you remember
when you lived there?

00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:33.226
And the war, bows, arrows, swords...
Did you see all this?

00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:35.059
I saw it.

00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:37.902
Did you fight in the war yourself?

00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:40.183
I was a child then.

00:05:41.412 --> 00:05:43.521
What about when you grew up?

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:53.394
I haven't grown up.

00:05:57.994 --> 00:06:00.090
Who was your father?
A King?

00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:01.960
The king was someone else.

00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:03.412
So, your Dad?

00:06:07.757 --> 00:06:09.957
I used to have a ring on my finger.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.420
A ring, like this?
- I have seen stones.

00:06:15.036 --> 00:06:16.879
Stones? What kind of stones?

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:19.523
Red, blue, yellow,
all kind of stones!

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.362
Were they expensive stones?
Did they shine and sparkle?

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.456
Yes, they did.

00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:27.106
These are new things he's saying.

00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:29.487
Where were these stones?
At your house?

00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:30.874
Yes.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.736
Were you rich?
Did you have a big house?

00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:35.174
No, a small house.

00:06:36.068 --> 00:06:38.858
Where were these
stones kept? In a chest?

00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:42.312
Or were they buried underground?

00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:47.347
I don't think he
remembers everything.

00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:50.188
He remembers certain things
and he says them.

00:06:50.988 --> 00:06:52.600
Very interesting!

00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:55.022
Tell me something,

00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.452
Dr Hajra is taking him
to Rajasthan. Doesn't he object?

00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:00.652
Why don't you ask him?

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:04.592
Will you go to Rajasthan
with the doctor?

00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:06.895
I want to see the golden fortress.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.317
The doctor will show it to me.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.575
Say cheese.

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:30.190
Why?

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.190
Smile... if you smile
the picture will be better.

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:35.210
I do not feel like smiling.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.922
There is no doubt that
all of the precious stones

00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:55.627
that Mukul speaks of
were secretly kept in his house.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:13.839
Hello... Hello?!

00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:16.549
Hold on, man!

00:08:17.707 --> 00:08:18.709
Hello?

00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:21.546
Hello?

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:23.974
This is Bose speaking.
- What is this concerning?

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:26.168
Did you read the
newspaper this morning?

00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:27.773
Your call woke me up.

00:08:28.042 --> 00:08:29.592
You should read it.
- What's in it?

00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:31.883
On the last page, towards the end.

00:08:32.343 --> 00:08:35.608
It's a good opportunity
if we invest wisely, we'll get rich.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.420
Tell me in detail.

00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:41.374
You read it, and I'll call you
after 10 minutes. - Okay.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.194
Listen! Don't shout so much.
This is a public telephone.

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:54.777
How much longer?

00:08:56.314 --> 00:08:57.532
It's been 20 minutes, already.

00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:00.522
Wait! You should not be
impatient in this matter.

00:09:01.116 --> 00:09:03.956
It's a golden opportunity.
Let us see for a while.

00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:08.714
Get the picture! Come on!

00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:13.695
Similar forehead,

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:16.539
nose...

00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:18.777
Good! Hair...

00:09:19.638 --> 00:09:21.278
Hey kid, turn your face towards us.

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:28.144
Darn it!

00:09:29.074 --> 00:09:31.764
Mukul, look at that kite.

00:09:33.126 --> 00:09:34.225
There it is!

00:09:50.397 --> 00:09:52.701
Could you tell us where
7 Jatindas Lane is?

00:09:53.752 --> 00:09:56.109
Number 7? That's the Fatiks' house.

00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:58.149
Could you show us where it is?

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:01.816
We're from Baluchistan, so, we're
unfamiliar with Kolkata's streets.

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:04.268
Okay, let's go.

00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:21.661
Does Pradosh Mitter live here?

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.061
Yes. Please come in.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:28.829
Please sit down.

00:10:34.084 --> 00:10:35.095
He's here.

00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:44.868
You will have to wait for
another three and a half minutes.

00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:04.022
What's the hurry? Look at him!

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:05.527
You are going to choke.

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:08.762
Look! He did not finish his milk.

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:10.255
He didn't even drink juice.

00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:13.406
He thinks that Felu's clients
are his clients too.

00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:16.899
Does that make any sense? God knows
what these two are up to now.

00:11:18.585 --> 00:11:21.399
Our family is filled
with adventurous people.

00:11:22.354 --> 00:11:23.754
I've never seen you be adventurous.

00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:25.655
I'm the black sheep of the family.

00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:27.747
But think about my elder brothers.

00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:32.176
Second brother used to pull out
fox cubs from their holes.

00:11:32.795 --> 00:11:34.453
He was just 10 years old then.

00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:37.295
Felu is his son.

00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:40.667
I am not taking about Felu.
He has chosen his profession.

00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:43.738
But my son has to study.
He has to go to school.

00:11:44.716 --> 00:11:46.687
Is there a teacher like Felu
at that school?

00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:05.727
Greetings, are you...

00:12:06.087 --> 00:12:07.104
Please be seated.

00:12:08.693 --> 00:12:09.910
My name is Sudhir Dhar.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.044
I own a book store
on College Street.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.184
Kailash Chowdhury from Shyampukur
is a regular client.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.663
He had a lot of good things
to say about you. No.

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:25.198
Tell me what the matter is.
- The matter is...

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.138
Have you seen this article?

00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:34.685
Yes, I did.

00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:38.691
Is Mukul your...
- Yes, he's my youngest son.

00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:43.977
He's very famous now.
Is all of what he's saying true?

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.596
Can he really remember
his past life?

00:12:46.838 --> 00:12:49.586
We don't understand it much,
but Dr Hajra says...

00:12:49.723 --> 00:12:52.723
Do you mean Dr Hemanga Hajra,
the parapsychologist,

00:12:53.192 --> 00:12:55.085
who recently returned from Canada?
- Yes.

00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:56.954
We met at the store.

00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:00.389
This mentions about going
to Rajasthan... - They already left.

00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:01.719
Left already?

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:04.144
They left yesterday
morning by train.

00:13:04.232 --> 00:13:06.921
They'll stay in Delhi for one day
and then they'll go to Rajasthan.

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:10.298
Do you think they went to Jodhpur?
- Yes, exactly!

00:13:10.969 --> 00:13:15.887
Jodhpur is a obvious. West Rajasthan
has both sand and forts.

00:13:15.968 --> 00:13:18.825
That's what Dr Hajra said.

00:13:19.218 --> 00:13:23.228
He said, he was researching rebirth.
He wanted to take Mukul along.

00:13:23.434 --> 00:13:27.409
If Mukul could recognise his place
of birth, a lot could be found.

00:13:28.026 --> 00:13:29.634
Well, since you're in
the book business,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.600
don't you have picture books
on Rajasthan?

00:13:32.838 --> 00:13:34.220
I mean, didn't you have them?

00:13:35.012 --> 00:13:38.431
The boy may be drawing pictures
because he saw them

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:40.924
and he is imagining it
to be his previous life.

00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:44.071
Children often come up
with strange ideas.

00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:46.318
I understand that.

00:13:46.817 --> 00:13:49.067
But drawing in the middle
of the night...

00:13:49.443 --> 00:13:50.511
Middle of the night?

00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:55.161
It happens sometimes at 2 or 3 am.

00:13:55.513 --> 00:13:57.313
Besides, take Dr Hajra for example.

00:13:57.626 --> 00:13:59.082
Mukul doesn't know him.

00:13:59.376 --> 00:14:03.975
But when he offered to show the
golden fortress, he was ready to go.

00:14:04.883 --> 00:14:07.640
He has never stayed
away from his parents.

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:10.761
Yet, he didn't even look back.
Honestly speaking,

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:12.554
in the last few months,

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:14.709
we feel as if
we don't even know him.

00:14:16.332 --> 00:14:20.180
He wasn't like this earlier.

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:22.332
He was very normal.

00:14:22.726 --> 00:14:25.604
Are you worried because
your son has changed? Because...

00:14:25.726 --> 00:14:27.735
No! That is not the case!

00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:30.040
I have a problem

00:14:30.297 --> 00:14:32.951
that I couldn't sleep
even for a second last night.

00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:37.321
Is that related to the treasure
he mentioned? - Yes.

00:14:37.675 --> 00:14:41.417
Yes, you're right. Printing it
in the paper has made it worse.

00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:44.408
He gave a statement to the paper
about the treasure though.

00:14:44.432 --> 00:14:47.034
Yes, he spoke about
expensive gemstones.

00:14:47.359 --> 00:14:49.757
He said that those were
in his own house.

00:14:50.151 --> 00:14:55.397
But his drawings show
ordinary houses.

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:59.196
Okay. - Another thing happened.
In our neighbourhood,

00:14:59.592 --> 00:15:02.618
there is another boy, my son's age.
His name is Mukul too.

00:15:03.912 --> 00:15:06.919
That boy was abducted
yesterday evening.

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:09.313
You mean, kidnapping!
- Yes.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.402
From the neighbourhood?
- Yes.

00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:13.927
He was returned this morning.

00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:20.979
So, you're afraid
that they realised their mistake

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.809
and now they'll attack your son.

00:15:24.121 --> 00:15:25.121
Yes.

00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:29.694
Did that boy tell them
where your son went?

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:33.592
I don't know that yet.
The boy is unconscious.

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.224
He was left at the roadside
while he was unconscious.

00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:38.556
A newspaper boy was
passing by on his bicycle.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.227
He recognised the boy
and notified his parents.

00:15:41.517 --> 00:15:44.335
He lives three houses down the lane,
Shivratan Mukherjee's house.

00:15:44.785 --> 00:15:45.816
The boy is his grandson.

00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:48.713
When I heard the news,
I came immediately to you.

00:15:56.573 --> 00:16:00.172
I know that I, probably,
shouldn't have come to you.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.385
We are ordinary people.
We have nothing to offer.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:07.636
But if you're willing to go
there, I'll pay the fare.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.243
Do you have a telephone?

00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:10.703
Yes, in my book store.

00:16:12.162 --> 00:16:14.655
If you call me after 10 am,
you can reach me.

00:16:16.322 --> 00:16:18.903
3 4 5 6 3 4.

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.401
Okay, I will let you know
by this afternoon.

00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:27.084
How can I thank you?
- No need.

00:16:27.393 --> 00:16:28.791
I haven't done anything yet.

00:16:29.015 --> 00:16:32.011
Yet, I'm grateful for being able
to share my story with you.

00:16:32.318 --> 00:16:33.331
I'll take your leave now.

00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:42.458
'Number 7 up, '

00:16:42.907 --> 00:16:46.870
'Toofan Express will leave
from platform number 8'

00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:50.363
' at 9:35 am.'

00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:53.360
'Attention, please!'

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.054
'Number 7 up, '

00:16:56.447 --> 00:16:57.615
'Toofan Express'

00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:00.806
'will leave from
platform number 8...' - Here!

00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:02.868
M Bose. A N Barman.

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:04.287
Let's go.

00:17:08.323 --> 00:17:10.482
The study of parapsychology
deals with

00:17:10.836 --> 00:17:14.897
understanding the abstract
thinking of human mind.

00:17:16.028 --> 00:17:17.028
For example,

00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:21.185
you are thinking about
an old friend of yours.

00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:24.812
That's when he calls you.

00:17:26.308 --> 00:17:27.652
People will say it's an accident,

00:17:28.738 --> 00:17:32.026
but a parapsychologist
would explain it as telepathy.

00:17:32.477 --> 00:17:34.046
Telepathy?
- Yes.

00:17:36.204 --> 00:17:37.688
Your friend call you

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:41.163
because you were thinking about him.
It's telepathy.

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:43.302
Understood?
- Yes.

00:17:45.495 --> 00:17:48.341
If you're thinking that I am going
to Rajasthan on this case,

00:17:48.922 --> 00:17:51.519
and that you will miss school
and go to Rajasthan with me,

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.176
that isn't final yet.

00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:57.244
You will definitely take this case.

00:17:57.825 --> 00:17:59.763
How do you know?
- Telepathy.

00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:03.618
Don't act smart!
Do you know how much work I have?

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.309
First of all, we have to create
a small budget.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.902
This guy isn't as rich
as Kailash Chowdhury.

00:18:13.262 --> 00:18:15.268
He isn't like Harish Poddar
from Janglipur either.

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:18.031
He can't write checks of
thousands of rupees.

00:18:20.128 --> 00:18:22.390
Probably, I will have
to spend some money.

00:18:23.446 --> 00:18:25.161
You always say that
money isn't everything.

00:18:25.512 --> 00:18:30.910
That's true, especially when
a 6 year-old boy's life

00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:33.989
is in danger.

00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:37.555
But if we want to save him,

00:18:39.249 --> 00:18:40.649
we will need some money.

00:18:41.402 --> 00:18:43.529
I feel I have to bear the expenses.

00:18:47.809 --> 00:18:49.397
We have to book train tickets.

00:18:50.678 --> 00:18:53.810
We will have to change trains
to go to Jodhpur.

00:18:54.942 --> 00:18:57.409
We need to book accommodations
in Jodhpur.

00:18:59.115 --> 00:19:02.209
We need warm clothes.
It's very cold there.

00:19:03.714 --> 00:19:07.157
We will have to go to
Uncle Sidhu's house once.

00:19:07.377 --> 00:19:08.382
Why?

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:10.785
I need some information.

00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:14.090
Hemanga Hajra.

00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:20.716
10 years ago, he was involved
in some kind of mess.

00:19:21.162 --> 00:19:22.171
What was it?

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.453
I don't remember. That's why we need
to go to your know-it-all uncle.

00:19:33.801 --> 00:19:34.838
'62...

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.625
In 1962...

00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:44.326
This is...

00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:49.324
I've found it.

00:19:50.044 --> 00:19:51.633
In 1962,

00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:53.919
in Allahabad,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.096
a man pretending to be
a preacher named Bhabananda,

00:19:58.718 --> 00:20:01.558
along with a scoundrel
of an assistant of his,

00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:06.416
started a heinous business
of treating illnesses

00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:09.225
using a unique process

00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:11.977
called hypnosis.

00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:16.000
In 18th century Europe,
such a thing was tried by

00:20:16.369 --> 00:20:17.800
Anton Mesmer.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.234
Bhabananda's business was booming.

00:20:22.897 --> 00:20:25.535
That's when Hemanga Hajra
went to visit them.

00:20:25.922 --> 00:20:27.204
And he caught the fraud.

00:20:27.229 --> 00:20:29.580
Yes, as a result,
Bhabananda was exposed

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.718
and Bhabananda and his assistant...
- Ran away!

00:20:35.416 --> 00:20:36.447
Now I remember.

00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:40.439
Does this have anything to do
with that kid, Mukul Dhar?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.980
Thank God, you aren't a detective,
or I'd be out of a job.

00:20:49.237 --> 00:20:53.458
If I wanted, I could have driven
many people out of job.

00:20:54.368 --> 00:20:55.755
So, I didn't do anything.

00:20:56.677 --> 00:20:59.502
I kept my mind open to
new possibilities

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:03.821
so that I remain fresh and happy.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.090
Or...

00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:08.584
You are a detective.

00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:13.109
Your business depend
on people's negative side.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.205
But don't let that

00:21:15.786 --> 00:21:19.720
pull your mind into darkness.

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.360
I've also kept my mind open.

00:21:22.342 --> 00:21:23.342
Have you?

00:21:24.864 --> 00:21:26.845
Who was William James Herschel?

00:21:27.448 --> 00:21:29.830
William James Herschel.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.002
An Englishman.

00:21:32.653 --> 00:21:33.655
ICS.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.911
He was posted in Bengal once.

00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:41.883
In 1880, his letter was published
in Nature magazine in England.

00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:45.879
This letter was the first to
indicate that fingerprints

00:21:46.491 --> 00:21:48.012
could be used to catch criminals.

00:21:48.857 --> 00:21:50.084
Bravo!

00:21:52.128 --> 00:21:53.888
Give me your hand.

00:21:54.894 --> 00:21:56.325
Bless you, my child!

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.962
How do you like this fort, Mukul?

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:15.561
This is not the golden fort.

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:19.886
Do you know the name of this place?

00:22:20.344 --> 00:22:21.349
Delhi.

00:22:21.645 --> 00:22:24.868
Do you remember the place
where your golden fort was?

00:22:25.547 --> 00:22:26.679
Try to remember.

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:31.629
No, I don't remember.

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:36.718
Come here, child.

00:22:40.748 --> 00:22:43.464
They are here to see you.

00:22:44.109 --> 00:22:47.385
They are good people. Look what
they have brought for you.

00:22:48.489 --> 00:22:51.209
Since you are so brave,
I'm giving you this gift.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.437
Great, look what's in here.

00:22:56.724 --> 00:22:57.772
A pistol!

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:04.723
Be careful, it's loaded.

00:23:07.401 --> 00:23:08.401
Yes!

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.907
Are you happy?

00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:14.159
Now answer
whatever question they have.

00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:16.588
I'll tell you

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:18.394
whatever he told us.

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:23.237
Last evening,
he went to the next lane

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:26.498
to collect a severed kite.

00:23:27.047 --> 00:23:28.554
Neelu asked me to get it.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.849
Yes, Neelu did.
- Where was Neelu?

00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:33.311
He was on the terrace
of the house opposite.

00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:35.689
Did he call you by your name?
- Yes.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.244
After that, when he went, a car
stopped at the entry of the lane.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.256
A taxi?
- No.

00:23:43.544 --> 00:23:45.322
An ordinary car. Black.

00:23:46.698 --> 00:23:48.677
Two men came out of the car

00:23:49.203 --> 00:23:51.220
and asked him to show an address.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.028
The Fatiks' house.

00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:54.791
How did the two men look?

00:23:55.614 --> 00:23:57.384
They had beards.
- Both of them?

00:23:57.663 --> 00:24:01.188
Yes. They said
they were from Baluchistan.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.180
Lies!
- Then?

00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:10.414
They covered my eyes and mouth
and took me to a house.

00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:14.086
Then they asked,
'Where is the golden fortress?'

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.973
I told them, I did not know,
but Mukul did.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.638
Then they asked me

00:24:21.069 --> 00:24:22.082
what my name was.

00:24:22.426 --> 00:24:24.679
I told them my name was Mukul too.

00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:28.191
Then they said, 'Mistake!'.

00:24:28.808 --> 00:24:29.814
Then...

00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:31.776
After that,

00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:33.516
they asked

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:35.660
where the other Mukul was.

00:24:36.004 --> 00:24:38.644
I said that he had gone away.

00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:41.219
They asked where.
- I told them...

00:24:42.363 --> 00:24:44.128
Jaipur.
- You said Jaipur!

00:24:44.709 --> 00:24:47.530
No, Jodhpur.

00:24:48.308 --> 00:24:52.244
After that,
they gave me a glass of milk.

00:24:52.843 --> 00:24:55.702
I told them that I didn't like milk.

00:24:56.299 --> 00:24:59.669
They forcefully opened my mouth
and fed it to me.

00:25:00.413 --> 00:25:01.419
After that,

00:25:01.956 --> 00:25:04.015
I started feeling sleepy.

00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:08.594
Do you see why I'm worried?

00:25:13.121 --> 00:25:16.839
Here you go,
this is Dr Hajra's business card.

00:25:17.439 --> 00:25:19.288
I have written two lines
on the back of it.

00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:21.475
Great!
That is a wise decision...

00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:24.927
What about the telegram?
- You left after asking me.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.856
I couldn't do it.
An English professor of City College

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.762
arrived at my shop then.

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:33.095
Please send me a telegram
once you reach. - Certainly.

00:25:33.755 --> 00:25:34.780
Look at this.

00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:39.303
'Pradosh Mitter,
arriving Jodhpur on 11th.'

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:41.716
Tomorrow is 9th.
You are leaving tomorrow.

00:25:41.898 --> 00:25:44.517
'Hence, arriving Jodhpur on 11th'

00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:49.265
'to ensure Mukul's safety against
possible criminal activity.'

00:25:50.032 --> 00:25:52.446
Nice.
- He add a 'regards' with it.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.702
'Number 7 up, Toofan Express'

00:25:58.186 --> 00:26:00.211
'will leave from platform number 8'

00:26:00.598 --> 00:26:03.550
'at 9:35 am.'

00:26:04.981 --> 00:26:07.994
'Number 7 up, Toofan Express'

00:26:09.264 --> 00:26:10.945
'will leave from platform number 8'

00:26:11.788 --> 00:26:14.363
'at 9:35 am.'

00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:27.875
'You may go.'

00:27:31.114 --> 00:27:32.633
'Have tea!'

00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:35.950
'Be careful of the bags!'

00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:17.361
It is not what you are thinking.

00:28:37.726 --> 00:28:38.788
Two sixes.

00:28:44.677 --> 00:28:46.627
Mukul, do you want to eat something?

00:28:48.813 --> 00:28:50.572
I have food for you.

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:52.716
I eat bread.

00:28:53.374 --> 00:28:56.222
Bread?
- Round and thick.

00:28:57.371 --> 00:28:58.651
Now or did you eat them earlier?

00:28:59.534 --> 00:29:00.534
I used to.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.468
Who used to make them? Your mother?

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:13.199
It has climbed a ladder.

00:29:20.548 --> 00:29:24.457
How? You got a 5.
How did you climb the ladder?

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:27.154
What do you mean 5?

00:29:27.755 --> 00:29:29.854
I thought it was a 4.
- A 4!

00:29:30.111 --> 00:29:31.824
Do I have cataract now?

00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:36.213
You don't have cataract.
You are drunk.

00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:38.282
You'll be fine if you drink less.

00:29:39.055 --> 00:29:41.031
Now slide back down again.
- Okay.

00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:46.011
Tell me, Mukul, did you have
a treasure at your house?

00:29:46.594 --> 00:29:47.655
Treasure?

00:29:47.956 --> 00:29:49.819
You told the reporters

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.780
that expensive stones were
hidden at your house.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:54.132
No, I didn't.

00:29:54.497 --> 00:29:55.507
Didn't you?

00:29:57.271 --> 00:29:59.581
Didn't you have
red, blue stones at your house?

00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:02.599
There were.
My father used to carve stones.

00:30:03.538 --> 00:30:04.735
Did he?

00:30:05.246 --> 00:30:06.248
Yes.

00:30:06.301 --> 00:30:08.564
Were those stones
used in making jewellery?

00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:10.186
Yes.

00:30:10.945 --> 00:30:11.951
I see.

00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:14.251
A lapidary!

00:30:15.594 --> 00:30:16.789
A gem cutter.

00:30:24.868 --> 00:30:26.531
I'm going outside to the corridor.

00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:28.399
Go ahead.

00:30:31.813 --> 00:30:35.853
It's over now, you've been
grabbed by the snake. What happened?

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:39.214
What happened?
- I'll be right back.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.178
Come back soon.
Then we'll play ludo.

00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:48.169
Excuse me.

00:31:56.383 --> 00:31:57.399
Mukul?

00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:03.079
What are you waiting for?

00:32:07.784 --> 00:32:10.083
Mukul, would you like
to see a magic trick?

00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:11.576
What magic?

00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:14.835
Watch...

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:21.273
Vanish!

00:32:22.586 --> 00:32:23.992
Did you see? Now look.

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:32.384
I have more. Give me. Look!

00:32:43.646 --> 00:32:46.429
You're going to see the
golden fortress, I presume? - Yes.

00:32:47.106 --> 00:32:49.004
Is it in Jodhpur?

00:32:49.185 --> 00:32:50.193
I don't know.

00:32:50.604 --> 00:32:51.606
He doesn't know.

00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:54.871
Expensive stones?

00:32:55.993 --> 00:32:58.754
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds?
- What's in that bottle?

00:32:59.608 --> 00:33:02.847
A drink made of cane sugar,
have you ever tasted it?

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.271
I'm going now.

00:33:07.778 --> 00:33:08.972
I'll walk you back.
- Okay.

00:33:19.187 --> 00:33:20.249
Where did he go?

00:33:20.654 --> 00:33:23.000
Who? - The man who
showed me a magic trick.

00:33:23.144 --> 00:33:25.952
Wow, in this short time,
you saw a magic trick!

00:33:26.175 --> 00:33:27.403
Sit down, now you have to eat.

00:33:30.022 --> 00:33:31.747
Oh no!
- What happened?

00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:34.877
Hajra is the same man, whom we know.

00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:36.296
So what?

00:33:36.484 --> 00:33:37.905
That's okay.

00:33:37.955 --> 00:33:40.628
But he could've seen me
within a moment.

00:33:40.653 --> 00:33:42.386
So what? It was a long time ago.

00:33:42.623 --> 00:33:46.566
Back in 1962, you had
long beards and longer hair.

00:33:46.614 --> 00:33:48.694
You were even wearing a robe.
How would he recognise?

00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:52.784
Yes!

00:33:53.861 --> 00:33:56.187
I didn't even think about that!
- You never do.

00:33:57.081 --> 00:33:58.702
We will kill two birds
with one stone.

00:33:59.233 --> 00:34:01.258
We will catch that boy

00:34:01.989 --> 00:34:03.916
and we'll seek revenge on Hajra.

00:34:04.492 --> 00:34:05.832
Kill him!
- Yes.

00:34:07.717 --> 00:34:09.182
He ruined my life!

00:34:09.207 --> 00:34:11.560
You know how many professions
we've changed in the last 10 years.

00:34:11.584 --> 00:34:12.947
Yes, yes! At least a
couple of hundred.

00:34:12.971 --> 00:34:15.109
I don't even have
two to three suits!

00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:20.769
At least, you have your own.
All my clothes are borrowed.

00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:22.244
Top to bottom!

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.720
No!

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:34.450
I won't let him win.

00:34:35.681 --> 00:34:36.837
So, give it to me.

00:34:37.738 --> 00:34:38.738
What?

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.417
We can't go into a war
without weapons.

00:34:44.077 --> 00:34:45.566
I'm the one that has to do the job.

00:34:45.773 --> 00:34:48.561
What is the use of
keeping it with you?

00:34:48.903 --> 00:34:51.127
Who said there is no other way
to kill than a gun?

00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:54.331
Go and befriend him.
That's your first job.

00:34:54.856 --> 00:34:55.956
What are you waiting for?

00:34:57.881 --> 00:34:59.408
Hold on!

00:35:01.414 --> 00:35:03.414
Did you figure out
how you will introduce yourself?

00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:05.586
You don't have to
think of those things.

00:35:05.695 --> 00:35:07.937
I scored a 56 in my board exams.
- In what subject?

00:35:08.825 --> 00:35:09.825
Geography.

00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:18.186
Okay.

00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:19.780
Now...

00:35:30.384 --> 00:35:31.392
Look!

00:35:31.572 --> 00:35:34.018
Take it. Let me show you.

00:35:34.537 --> 00:35:35.668
It is better this way.

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:37.429
Look!

00:35:41.857 --> 00:35:43.044
Do you like it?

00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:46.992
You are not only smart in geography,
but you have other qualities too.

00:35:48.989 --> 00:35:52.420
I've learned all this abroad.
I've met a lot of magicians.

00:35:53.274 --> 00:35:55.131
Do you carry the equipment along?

00:35:55.394 --> 00:35:57.727
There isn't a shortage
of children in the world.

00:35:58.153 --> 00:36:00.015
I'm only glad to
make children happy.

00:36:03.112 --> 00:36:04.509
You are going to Jodhpur, right?

00:36:04.979 --> 00:36:07.654
There is a fort on the way.
Then we will go to Jodhpur.

00:36:07.885 --> 00:36:08.885
The golden fort?

00:36:09.343 --> 00:36:10.366
It could be.

00:36:11.506 --> 00:36:12.511
Where is that again?

00:36:13.163 --> 00:36:15.568
Jaipur City.
Nahargar Fort.

00:36:16.365 --> 00:36:20.315
I see. In my train compartment
there is a man, Mr Bagchi.

00:36:21.278 --> 00:36:22.548
He is researching about forts.

00:36:23.384 --> 00:36:25.921
I think he mentioned that name.

00:36:26.834 --> 00:36:29.050
We'll reach at 7:30.
After we see the fort,

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.642
We'll go to Jodhpur
by the evening train. - I see.

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:49.808
Porter!

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.652
There you are!

00:36:54.463 --> 00:36:56.280
We should leave our
things at the station.

00:36:56.457 --> 00:36:58.857
Obviously! You can't climb up
the mountain carrying all this.

00:37:00.823 --> 00:37:02.148
Let's go, porter.

00:37:13.993 --> 00:37:15.620
Topshe, eat this sweet.

00:37:16.577 --> 00:37:18.752
The train is delayed.
We will reach Kanpur late.

00:37:19.046 --> 00:37:20.139
The breakfast will be late.

00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:35.545
Beautiful scenery!
It reminds me of Spain.

00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:52.705
I'm worried.

00:37:58.474 --> 00:38:01.152
If Mukul and Mr Hajra
stayed in Delhi for a day

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.875
and if those people left
the day before yesterday,

00:38:06.514 --> 00:38:08.979
they may be on the same train.

00:38:09.562 --> 00:38:11.210
They won't do anything to Mukul.

00:38:12.362 --> 00:38:13.768
They won't do anything yet,

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.824
because Mukul is
their key to the treasure.

00:38:18.357 --> 00:38:19.439
And Dr Hajra?

00:38:21.645 --> 00:38:23.785
If they could kidnap
a 7 year-old child

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.204
and leave him unconscious
on the roadside,

00:38:30.048 --> 00:38:35.042
I don't think they'd show mercy
to a 50 year-old professor.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:44.417
Go ahead, sir.
- What's wrong?

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.054
I have a pebble in my shoe.

00:38:46.321 --> 00:38:49.475
It's okay. There is no train
to Jodhpur before evening.

00:39:09.732 --> 00:39:11.263
Did you notice something?
- What?

00:39:12.331 --> 00:39:13.331
There's another fort.

00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:15.495
Where?
- Look over there!

00:39:16.984 --> 00:39:18.384
Way over there!

00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:23.418
Take out your binoculars to see it.

00:39:27.474 --> 00:39:30.532
This isn't the golden fort!
This is another fort.

00:39:30.633 --> 00:39:32.133
This isn't the golden fort.

00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:35.510
I agree. Let's leave immediately.

00:39:35.805 --> 00:39:38.245
We have to see even more forts.

00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:42.263
Where is he?
- Who?

00:39:42.367 --> 00:39:44.156
Mr Hajra?
- Vanish!

00:40:14.371 --> 00:40:16.913
Did you do a magic trick?
- Yes, it's magic!

00:40:18.404 --> 00:40:21.639
Won't he come back?
- Crazy! He was scared of camels.

00:40:22.232 --> 00:40:25.714
He said what if they kicked him
with their twisted legs!

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:27.958
He's a very irresponsible man.

00:40:31.506 --> 00:40:33.712
Who will show me the golden fort?

00:40:33.818 --> 00:40:37.263
Why? We'll show you.
Consider him to be Dr Hajra.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.813
Come on, doctor.

00:40:40.995 --> 00:40:42.312
He is Dr Hajra too!

00:40:42.593 --> 00:40:46.906
Yes, he is Dr Hajra too. There are
many people named Dr Hajra.

00:40:47.225 --> 00:40:48.812
I know four people named Dr Hajra.

00:40:50.006 --> 00:40:51.567
I know another boy named Mukul.

00:40:51.898 --> 00:40:54.339
Do you, really? That's great!

00:41:12.683 --> 00:41:13.683
Kanpur.

00:41:16.203 --> 00:41:18.184
Porter!

00:41:21.475 --> 00:41:22.475
Breakfast.

00:41:25.846 --> 00:41:26.892
Come here.

00:41:27.854 --> 00:41:32.521
Be careful! The suitcase is from
Japan. It's imported! Put it here.

00:41:32.905 --> 00:41:34.198
Put it down!

00:41:35.611 --> 00:41:36.611
Careful!

00:41:39.186 --> 00:41:40.569
Put the luggage under the bench.

00:41:41.251 --> 00:41:42.270
Move.

00:41:43.984 --> 00:41:45.784
And this... Keep it here.

00:41:46.797 --> 00:41:47.878
Yes.

00:41:55.912 --> 00:41:57.924
Take it.

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:00.518
Don't whine,
this is more than enough!

00:42:00.888 --> 00:42:02.331
Go!

00:42:08.765 --> 00:42:10.334
Piping hot tea!

00:42:16.873 --> 00:42:18.870
How far are you both going?

00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:22.996
Jodhpur.

00:42:24.528 --> 00:42:26.128
I am also going there.

00:42:29.067 --> 00:42:33.294
I want to write a story on Jodhpur.

00:42:34.307 --> 00:42:36.086
A suspense thriller!

00:42:40.482 --> 00:42:44.215
Up to date,
I have written 27 stories.

00:42:46.094 --> 00:42:48.931
All of them published.

00:42:56.558 --> 00:42:57.577
Here you go,

00:42:58.616 --> 00:43:01.967
this is my latest one.

00:43:02.629 --> 00:43:05.544
It is based on characters,
who live in the Gobi Desert.

00:43:06.936 --> 00:43:09.050
'Mighty Enemy!'

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:10.833
Are you Jatayu?

00:43:11.354 --> 00:43:12.470
That's my pen name.

00:43:15.882 --> 00:43:18.867
My real name is Lal Mohan Ganguly.

00:43:20.801 --> 00:43:24.809
When the evil Ravan had abducted
Sita and was taking her away,

00:43:25.771 --> 00:43:29.246
the bird Jatayu tried to stop him.

00:43:30.278 --> 00:43:34.246
Jatayu was an amazing bird.
That's my pen name.

00:43:37.863 --> 00:43:39.438
Do you know how to read Bengali?

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.844
I can speak too.

00:43:42.047 --> 00:43:43.091
Where did you learn?

00:43:45.132 --> 00:43:46.141
Kolkata.

00:43:47.672 --> 00:43:48.678
What?

00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:50.944
You may carry on with Hindi.
It sounds amazing.

00:43:53.258 --> 00:43:54.462
Darn it, sir!

00:43:55.061 --> 00:43:57.893
I'm a Bengali through and through.
Why would I speak Hindi willingly?

00:43:58.434 --> 00:43:59.505
Look at this.

00:43:59.927 --> 00:44:02.270
Here, I've been
roaming around with this.

00:44:05.998 --> 00:44:07.716
You seem to be travelling
from a long time.

00:44:07.884 --> 00:44:09.613
Yes, since December 15th.

00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:15.729
I can tell by the colour of
your skin under your watch band.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.070
Watch?

00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:20.007
Wow!

00:44:21.364 --> 00:44:23.748
You have amazing observation,
just like a detective.

00:44:23.968 --> 00:44:25.217
Do you read detective novels?

00:44:26.045 --> 00:44:27.373
My cousin reads them.

00:44:27.578 --> 00:44:29.248
Really? Very nice.

00:44:29.462 --> 00:44:31.993
Yes, I've read many of your books.
- Really? Name them.

00:44:32.146 --> 00:44:33.552
'Shivering in Sahara',

00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.321
'Havoc in Honduras'

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.626
'Mishap in Myanmar.'
- Amazing!

00:44:39.148 --> 00:44:41.729
You haven't read this, right?
This is my latest publication.

00:44:42.935 --> 00:44:44.295
Here, let me autograph it for you.

00:44:45.212 --> 00:44:46.280
What's your name?

00:44:46.305 --> 00:44:48.149
Topesh Ranjan Mitter.

00:44:52.232 --> 00:44:54.094
Topesh Ranjan Mitter.

00:44:57.976 --> 00:45:02.344
Let me take down your name
and address since we just met.

00:45:04.898 --> 00:45:09.400
Pradosh Mitter. 21, Rajani Sen Road,
Kolkata 700029.

00:45:10.182 --> 00:45:11.551
700029.

00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:14.342
Pin code.

00:45:18.439 --> 00:45:20.146
Pradosh Mitter!

00:45:20.555 --> 00:45:22.602
Are you a swimmer?
English Channel...

00:45:23.016 --> 00:45:24.045
Dhakuria Lake.

00:45:27.743 --> 00:45:30.489
Why are you going to Jodhpur?
A vacation?

00:45:31.504 --> 00:45:32.557
Something like that.

00:45:32.931 --> 00:45:35.900
Your face reminds me
of my stories' hero.

00:45:37.592 --> 00:45:38.592
Like Prakhar Rudra?

00:45:38.705 --> 00:45:40.123
Correct! Prakhar Rudra.

00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:45.481
Height: 6 feet 3.5 inches.
Chest: 46 inches.

00:45:45.678 --> 00:45:49.818
Waist: 32 inches. Shoulder:
22 inches. Wrist: 8.5 inches. Right?

00:45:50.865 --> 00:45:52.508
No.
- No?

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:54.614
What is your chest size?

00:45:54.928 --> 00:45:56.405
Only 26 inches.

00:45:57.843 --> 00:45:58.849
Waist?

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.161
Same.

00:46:02.342 --> 00:46:03.717
Are you a pig?

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.604
Is there a doctor here?

00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:35.357
You must know about
the Aravalli Mountain Range.

00:46:36.885 --> 00:46:40.264
The length is 480 km. Height of
highest peak in Mount Abu is 1722 m.

00:46:40.507 --> 00:46:42.680
There aren't many trees,
mostly sand and stones.

00:46:42.931 --> 00:46:46.068
I'm not talking about that.
I'm asking about the bandits there.

00:46:46.454 --> 00:46:48.335
That place is full of scary bandits.

00:46:48.879 --> 00:46:49.913
I've heard that too.

00:46:51.007 --> 00:46:54.640
My next novel will be based on that.
What do you think?

00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:57.503
Write a novel if you want,
but don't get hurt in the process.

00:46:58.692 --> 00:47:00.171
Do you mean that?
- Definitely.

00:47:04.343 --> 00:47:06.415
Shouldn't I trust this either?

00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:14.400
This is for self-defence.

00:47:15.894 --> 00:47:17.311
I bought it in Nepal.

00:47:27.518 --> 00:47:30.976
Do you know how bandits in Aravalli
punish their enemies?

00:47:31.724 --> 00:47:32.733
Behead them?

00:47:35.662 --> 00:47:37.569
No, they cut off their nose.
- Nose?

00:47:37.773 --> 00:47:39.391
Yes, and then leave them.

00:47:40.504 --> 00:47:43.827
I'll have to write about this then!

00:47:47.143 --> 00:47:50.469
But this is good, what say?

00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:53.532
Guess how much it costs.

00:47:53.779 --> 00:47:54.851
Rs 50.75.

00:48:01.888 --> 00:48:04.215
The money label
is still on the handle.

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:13.402
You have amazing observation!
I must take advantage of you.

00:48:14.126 --> 00:48:15.858
Would you like to take me
on your adventure?

00:48:15.883 --> 00:48:17.043
Can you ride on a camel?

00:48:17.906 --> 00:48:19.955
Camel? Will I have to ride a camel?

00:48:20.807 --> 00:48:21.818
Probably.

00:48:22.162 --> 00:48:23.639
Oh my!

00:48:24.481 --> 00:48:27.935
That's my dream.
Such a strange animal!

00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:31.557
It carries its own water supply
in the stomach

00:48:32.082 --> 00:48:36.319
and travels miles after
miles in the desert.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.525
I already gave that
information in my book.

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:41.303
Did you know where?
- It's in 'Shivering in Sahara'.

00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.622
Correct. - Did you write that
they carry water in their stomach?

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.203
Yes, this is its 6th edition.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.416
For the 7th,
you should correct it. - What?

00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:52.973
A camel gets water supply from
its hump, which is accumulated fat.

00:48:53.044 --> 00:48:56.072
Camels oxidise the fat to get water.

00:48:56.529 --> 00:48:58.009
It has nothing
to do with its stomach.

00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:12.689
By the grace of God,
your bones aren't broken.

00:49:13.937 --> 00:49:16.724
I think you should rest for the day.

00:49:18.104 --> 00:49:21.009
I'll send you food from my home.

00:49:22.267 --> 00:49:23.269
The child

00:49:23.876 --> 00:49:25.426
is in danger, doctor.

00:49:26.477 --> 00:49:27.805
How can I rest now?

00:49:29.174 --> 00:49:31.117
Don't you know anyone in Jodhpur?

00:49:32.464 --> 00:49:33.467
No.

00:49:34.988 --> 00:49:36.338
Then do one thing.

00:49:37.006 --> 00:49:40.856
Inform the police
as soon as you reach Jodhpur.

00:49:41.767 --> 00:49:43.019
The main problem

00:49:44.132 --> 00:49:46.662
is that my passport, ID,

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.483
everything is in my suitcase.

00:50:27.409 --> 00:50:28.929
Circuit House.

00:50:29.212 --> 00:50:31.301
He has bookings at Circuit House.
- I see.

00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:37.707
You need new clothes, right?

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.086
Could you please give
me a local outfit?

00:50:41.924 --> 00:50:43.326
You want to wear Rajasthani outfit?

00:50:44.821 --> 00:50:48.319
It will help me disguise myself.

00:50:50.306 --> 00:50:52.783
Hey! Help me to move this down.

00:50:55.179 --> 00:50:56.185
Okay.

00:50:57.369 --> 00:51:00.122
You took all the money.
Give me some of it.

00:51:00.204 --> 00:51:02.350
He took all the money along.
There is nothing here.

00:51:02.507 --> 00:51:04.834
Put this down.
We have a lot of work to do.

00:51:05.122 --> 00:51:07.109
I need to study a few things.

00:51:08.306 --> 00:51:11.173
So, I don't get any rewards
for this hard work!

00:51:18.315 --> 00:51:20.905
Mukul, what are you singing?

00:51:29.206 --> 00:51:30.449
Please sign here, doctor.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.740
Here is the key.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.432
This telegram is for you.

00:51:48.725 --> 00:51:49.876
Mukul, let's go.

00:51:51.754 --> 00:51:54.245
Are we in the same room?
- Yes.

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.066
You have reservations
for Mr Barman and Mr Bose, right?

00:51:57.559 --> 00:52:00.160
Mr Barman has thrombosis,
he could not come.

00:52:07.901 --> 00:52:09.326
Won't Mr Harja join us?

00:52:13.907 --> 00:52:15.652
Send some tea in my room.

00:52:32.863 --> 00:52:33.887
Dr Hajra!

00:52:36.124 --> 00:52:37.126
What happened?

00:52:45.557 --> 00:52:47.037
Did they send a bodyguard
for the boy?

00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:50.618
Bodyguard, detective, lizard...
Call him whatever you want.

00:52:51.457 --> 00:52:52.469
Pradosh Mitter!

00:52:53.543 --> 00:52:54.556
Do you know him?

00:52:55.386 --> 00:52:59.220
It doesn't matter if I don't.
The question is if Dr Hajra does.

00:53:00.264 --> 00:53:02.129
Then you'll get caught.
The game will be over.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.053
Do we have a choice?

00:53:08.259 --> 00:53:10.400
What if he doesn't know him?
- Then there isn't much risk.

00:53:10.424 --> 00:53:13.250
But there is still a chance.
- Yes, there is.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.066
The 11th?

00:53:17.922 --> 00:53:18.922
That means today.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760
Today...

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:23.807
Since they didn't arrive
by the morning train,

00:53:24.005 --> 00:53:26.199
they may arrive by evening.

00:53:30.512 --> 00:53:34.780
Will the lizard eat the scorpion
or will the scorpion eat the lizard?

00:53:35.574 --> 00:53:36.599
What are you thinking?

00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:39.640
I have an empty jar in my room.

00:53:40.535 --> 00:53:41.695
Are you planning to catch it?

00:53:43.926 --> 00:53:45.081
You'll catch it.

00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:47.451
Find another solution.

00:53:49.538 --> 00:53:52.350
Do you know how dangerous it is?
I'll be dead meat.

00:53:53.783 --> 00:53:57.958
Do you want a share
of the treasure or not?

00:54:00.033 --> 00:54:01.683
Okay, give me the jar.

00:54:11.823 --> 00:54:14.010
Piping hot tea!

00:54:17.194 --> 00:54:18.668
Thank you very much, doctor.

00:54:19.684 --> 00:54:23.284
Do exactly as I told you.

00:54:23.934 --> 00:54:26.791
Take care of yourself
and I wish you best of luck.

00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:29.366
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

00:54:34.906 --> 00:54:37.745
Wonderful tea!

00:54:38.477 --> 00:54:41.197
The tea is ordinary,
but it's probably camel milk.

00:54:41.713 --> 00:54:43.529
Camel? Amazing animal!

00:55:25.796 --> 00:55:26.983
Hey!

00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:05.626
Highly suspicious!

00:56:09.819 --> 00:56:10.819
Taxi, sir?

00:56:11.338 --> 00:56:12.344
Yes, Circuit House.

00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:14.269
Pick up the luggage.

00:56:14.892 --> 00:56:17.560
Let's go. We'll drop you off.
- Okay, let's share the price.

00:56:17.785 --> 00:56:18.904
Sure.

00:56:19.567 --> 00:56:20.605
Mister!

00:56:21.282 --> 00:56:22.532
Be careful with the luggage.

00:56:49.286 --> 00:56:50.305
Please sign here.

00:56:52.556 --> 00:56:53.569
Dr Hajra.

00:56:55.299 --> 00:56:57.705
What room is Dr Hajra in?
- Number one.

00:56:58.281 --> 00:57:00.745
Where is that room?
- The door behind you.

00:57:06.098 --> 00:57:07.500
Room number 3 for you.

00:57:10.072 --> 00:57:12.469
May I go with him?
- Yes, and take this.

00:57:20.806 --> 00:57:21.828
Are you Bengali?

00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:25.278
You too?
- There is another man.

00:57:26.084 --> 00:57:28.404
A witchdoctor.
- A witchdoctor?

00:57:28.631 --> 00:57:31.609
He is interested in past life.
He has no interest in the present.

00:57:33.196 --> 00:57:34.467
Does he have a child with him?

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:36.142
A child?

00:57:36.642 --> 00:57:38.581
He says he's 750 years old.

00:57:38.969 --> 00:57:42.568
I need to speak to him.
- They are in room number one.

00:57:50.245 --> 00:57:51.507
Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:57:51.556 --> 00:57:53.150
Are you Dr Hajra?
- Yes.

00:57:53.354 --> 00:57:55.126
Did you receive the telegram
from Mr Sudhir Dhar?

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:57.827
Yes, but you are...
- I am Pradosh Mitter.

00:57:58.336 --> 00:58:00.277
Here's my card.
- I see.

00:58:00.737 --> 00:58:02.917
And this is a letter from Mr Dhar.

00:58:06.217 --> 00:58:08.295
What is the matter?
- I'll tell you.

00:58:09.744 --> 00:58:11.752
Before that, let me acquaint
myself with Mukul.

00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:14.857
Mukul, look.
Two guests have come to see you.

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.209
I'm Felu and this is Topshe.

00:58:20.094 --> 00:58:21.507
What are you drawing, Mukul?

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:24.476
Mukul!

00:58:24.778 --> 00:58:25.784
The golden fort.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.486
Have a seat.

00:58:35.565 --> 00:58:37.027
Wow! The scorpion is nice.

00:58:37.846 --> 00:58:39.757
Is it still in the jar?

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.350
Didn't you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

00:58:51.738 --> 00:58:54.170
No phone call, enquiry
or anything else!

00:58:54.674 --> 00:58:56.149
Nothing yet.

00:58:56.510 --> 00:59:00.843
Although, I had no idea, or
I would've tried to keep an eye.

00:59:01.822 --> 00:59:03.155
It's okay, I'm here.

00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:06.586
If anything seems strange,
let me know.

00:59:06.815 --> 00:59:09.526
Of course.
It is my responsibility, after all.

00:59:10.012 --> 00:59:11.172
You went to Allahabad, right?

00:59:12.413 --> 00:59:15.075
I heard how you had
caught Bhabananda.

00:59:16.433 --> 00:59:19.330
It's a long story.
- Did you go out today?

00:59:19.798 --> 00:59:22.813
I took him to see the fort here.

00:59:23.475 --> 00:59:26.043
But it was no use.
We didn't even get out of the car.

00:59:26.553 --> 00:59:28.047
Yet, you have sand in your shoes.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:29.919
Nahargarh.

00:59:30.542 --> 00:59:33.157
Nahargarh?
- There was sand at Nahargarh.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.351
Nahargarh? The fort near Jaipur?

00:59:36.718 --> 00:59:39.543
Since we had to pass by Jaipur,

00:59:39.855 --> 00:59:42.650
so I decided to show him
the fort there.

00:59:42.884 --> 00:59:44.095
You had to change the train.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.255
Yes. We went by the morning train
and came by the evening one.

00:59:47.575 --> 00:59:48.580
Vanish.

00:59:49.112 --> 00:59:50.118
Vanish?

00:59:50.471 --> 00:59:52.196
The bad guy vanished.

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:53.892
Which bad guy, Mukul?

00:59:54.199 --> 00:59:56.324
The bad guy,
who is afraid of camels.

00:59:56.495 --> 00:59:59.008
Aren't you afraid of camels?

00:59:59.491 --> 01:00:03.098
I have ridden camels.
We had camels at my house.

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.073
I...

01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:13.951
I'm not sure when he transitions
from his past life to present.

01:00:15.432 --> 01:00:18.473
What is your plan for tomorrow?
- We're going to Bikaner tomorrow.

01:00:19.273 --> 01:00:20.325
That's my only job now.

01:00:20.819 --> 01:00:22.631
Okay, we'll accompany you.

01:00:23.403 --> 01:00:26.533
May I borrow this
parapsychology journal? - Sure.

01:00:27.288 --> 01:00:28.293
Let's go, Topshe.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:35.281
Are there other Bengalis
in this Circuit House?

01:00:35.794 --> 01:00:37.839
It's just you, us

01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:40.732
and Mr Bose, the globetrotter.

01:00:41.302 --> 01:00:43.910
Do you mean the person
I met outside? He is a globetrotter!

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:45.510
Yes. That's him.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:48.384
Interesting! I'll see you later.

01:01:00.576 --> 01:01:01.702
Serious, isn't he?

01:01:05.758 --> 01:01:07.286
Are you talking about Mukul?

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:09.420
Yes, he didn't talk to me at all.

01:01:11.282 --> 01:01:13.559
He's not in a normal state of mind.

01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:19.297
He is in a confused state.

01:01:23.318 --> 01:01:25.698
Until he is out of this state,

01:01:27.232 --> 01:01:28.251
it is

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.643
unfair to expect him
to behave normally.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:36.889
He has left his family behind

01:01:41.429 --> 01:01:43.853
and now he is looking for

01:01:48.363 --> 01:01:49.931
the golden fortress

01:01:54.724 --> 01:01:57.781
in the west of Rajasthan
with a complete stranger.

01:01:58.511 --> 01:02:02.344
Why does he speak of this fort
so much? Is it really made of gold?

01:02:03.831 --> 01:02:06.293
I don't think anything
like that exists.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:07.831
Then?

01:02:09.671 --> 01:02:11.502
That means,
we need to think about it.

01:02:13.391 --> 01:02:15.351
Golden opportunity doesn't mean
it's made of gold.

01:02:16.924 --> 01:02:18.139
Golden Bengal,

01:02:20.264 --> 01:02:21.623
or golden crop...

01:02:22.495 --> 01:02:24.027
Are these made of gold?

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:48.127
Those people didn't come here yet.

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:51.067
Perhaps they couldn't
book train tickets.

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:54.393
Or they may be staying elsewhere.

01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:57.237
What if they don't come at all?

01:02:57.638 --> 01:03:00.787
Then there's nothing to worry about.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.387
Felu!

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.670
Call the attendant.

01:03:11.714 --> 01:03:12.847
Topshe, come and see.

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:16.738
You may not get another chance to
see such a creature from this close.

01:03:22.156 --> 01:03:24.021
Look at the hook on its tail.

01:03:24.702 --> 01:03:25.707
What if it stings?

01:03:26.151 --> 01:03:27.276
Extremely poisonous!

01:03:28.198 --> 01:03:32.690
Children and elderly people
will die. We'll be half dead.

01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:37.073
Look!

01:03:40.342 --> 01:03:42.440
How did this get into the room?
I'm not sure.

01:03:43.859 --> 01:03:47.108
Make sure this is gone
and bring me a clean glass, please.

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:51.208
What happened?
I heard some noise here.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.086
Look at this.

01:03:54.924 --> 01:03:57.608
Oh my God!
I've seen such a thing abroad!

01:03:58.071 --> 01:03:59.354
This is pure Indian.

01:03:59.948 --> 01:04:01.455
Think about it!

01:04:02.229 --> 01:04:03.618
Are you here on a vacation?

01:04:05.719 --> 01:04:06.900
Look at the beginning!

01:04:09.382 --> 01:04:11.676
You can't even rest somewhere.

01:04:12.429 --> 01:04:14.369
Sit down, sir.
- Okay.

01:04:16.884 --> 01:04:18.136
So, you're a globetrotter.

01:04:18.598 --> 01:04:19.793
You already know that!

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.568
Which places have you been to?

01:04:43.093 --> 01:04:44.213
Which places have I been to?

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.884
Where haven't I
been is the question.

01:04:49.843 --> 01:04:51.345
I left home when I was 16

01:04:51.814 --> 01:04:55.142
and I returned last October,
26 years later.

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.645
I'm surprised
your Bengali accent hasn't changed.

01:04:59.277 --> 01:05:01.539
You still sound
as if you're from North Kolkata.

01:05:02.952 --> 01:05:03.958
Of course.

01:05:04.481 --> 01:05:08.259
Once you are abroad,
you may forget Bengali in 3 months.

01:05:08.854 --> 01:05:11.518
But if you don't want to,
you will never.

01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:15.185
I came in contact Bengalis often.

01:05:17.241 --> 01:05:19.986
I was in ivory business in Kenya

01:05:21.331 --> 01:05:22.369
for 5 years.

01:05:23.767 --> 01:05:25.180
My partner was a Bengali.

01:06:40.906 --> 01:06:42.506
You are going to Bikaner
tomorrow, right?

01:06:43.545 --> 01:06:44.645
Why don't you join us?

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.924
If there's a big group, I can go.

01:06:52.768 --> 01:06:54.497
Are you coming to dinner?
- Yes, definitely.

01:06:55.747 --> 01:06:57.754
I'll see you then.

01:06:58.422 --> 01:07:00.782
Let me check if my room is safe.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.345
I'm going.

01:07:09.012 --> 01:07:12.155
He has returned home after 26 years.
Did you see his shoes?

01:07:12.685 --> 01:07:14.458
It was an Indian brand.
- Right.

01:07:15.517 --> 01:07:18.135
I wouldn't be surprised
if his jacket was bought in Kolkata.

01:07:18.391 --> 01:07:19.391
What do you mean?

01:07:19.845 --> 01:07:22.004
We have to keep an eye on him.

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.990
Topshe,

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.753
get out the torch.

01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:27.683
We can't stay relaxed
anymore, Topshe.

01:09:02.718 --> 01:09:04.082
Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:09:07.698 --> 01:09:09.792
Are you still okay?
- Nothing has happened, yet.

01:09:13.699 --> 01:09:14.391
Good morning, sir.

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:15.781
Good morning.
- Your taxi is here.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:17.968
Good. Send this telegram.
It's urgent.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:23.461
Let's see what you're carrying.

01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:29.038
Okay, keep them in the car.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:52.642
Good morning!
- Good morning.

01:09:56.742 --> 01:09:57.907
Is this your disguise?

01:10:01.086 --> 01:10:02.355
Great place, this is!

01:10:03.755 --> 01:10:05.994
I challenged the hotel manager
for a fist fight.

01:10:06.863 --> 01:10:08.395
He refused.
- How lucky!

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.774
What?
- I'm talking about him.

01:10:11.496 --> 01:10:12.552
Let me introduce you.

01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:15.658
This is the renowned mystery
author, Lal Mohan Ganguly

01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:17.671
and this is Mr Bose, a globetrotter.

01:10:18.425 --> 01:10:19.425
Wow.

01:10:20.677 --> 01:10:23.002
Amazing! What are you saying?

01:10:23.776 --> 01:10:25.713
I must get to know you better.

01:10:26.044 --> 01:10:28.245
I bet you have many exciting
experiences in your life.

01:10:29.442 --> 01:10:32.061
Except for being boiled
in a pot by a cannibal...

01:10:32.716 --> 01:10:34.411
Everything else.
- Ready?

01:10:36.374 --> 01:10:38.592
Are we going to see
the golden fort today? - Yes, son.

01:10:41.098 --> 01:10:42.978
What is that by your ear?
- This is a new style.

01:10:43.012 --> 01:10:44.665
Really?
- You didn't know?

01:10:46.803 --> 01:10:49.892
Let's go then. Mr Ganguly
and Mr Bose will go in the same car.

01:10:50.398 --> 01:10:51.518
Are you going to see a fort?

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:54.536
Not the Jodhpur one. Bikaner.

01:10:54.949 --> 01:10:56.598
Bikaner? That's...

01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:59.601
That's where the fort is.
- Wow!

01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:02.744
We'll share the taxi fare,
otherwise I won't go.

01:11:03.013 --> 01:11:04.032
Okay, get in.

01:11:04.155 --> 01:11:06.495
Are we going to pass by
the marketplace?

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:09.101
I need something to protect my head.

01:11:23.555 --> 01:11:24.568
One more.

01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:27.370
Give me a toothbrush.

01:11:36.953 --> 01:11:39.093
Yes. Okay.

01:11:42.362 --> 01:11:43.802
I have the same problem as Mr Bose.

01:11:45.327 --> 01:11:46.734
What?
- I need something too.

01:11:49.209 --> 01:11:50.725
Give me that blue one.

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:03.577
Why are you here? - I need something
for the 480 km trip too.

01:12:03.739 --> 01:12:05.388
480 km? Bikaner is 480 km?

01:12:05.643 --> 01:12:07.484
Around 480 km.
- I see.

01:12:07.818 --> 01:12:10.077
You should buy a straw hat.
- How much?

01:12:12.167 --> 01:12:13.447
Have you ever been to Kathmandu?

01:12:14.945 --> 01:12:16.225
Have you ever been to Kamchatka?

01:12:18.058 --> 01:12:19.298
I'd like to show you something.

01:12:19.644 --> 01:12:21.727
Only you can appreciate it.

01:12:27.397 --> 01:12:28.613
This is an unsafe razor.

01:12:29.504 --> 01:12:31.043
This belonged to King Jang Bahadur.

01:12:32.368 --> 01:12:34.808
Wow! The rust is enough
to explain that.

01:12:35.395 --> 01:12:36.590
Why do you have it?

01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:38.717
Well, sir,

01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:41.918
don't you think I should carry
some protection in Rajasthan?

01:12:42.373 --> 01:12:45.641
Which side are you on?
The Mughals or Rajputs?

01:12:47.816 --> 01:12:51.287
Driver, are there bandits
in Rajasthan?

01:12:51.544 --> 01:12:52.955
Yes, there are, sir.
- See?

01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:56.667
Are you expecting
a razor fight in Rajasthan?

01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:00.592
Wow! Wonderful!

01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:03.009
That would be a great name.

01:13:03.433 --> 01:13:04.723
Let me write it down.

01:13:05.111 --> 01:13:08.223
The book will sell
because of its name.

01:13:09.904 --> 01:13:12.086
'Razor fight in Rajasthan!'

01:13:13.967 --> 01:13:15.688
I used a dagger like this
to kill a wolf.

01:13:17.425 --> 01:13:18.426
Where?

01:13:18.877 --> 01:13:22.364
Tanganika. It was a dense forest
and I was alone.

01:13:24.088 --> 01:13:25.214
Tanganika?

01:13:25.414 --> 01:13:27.245
Yes, it's in Africa.
Haven't you heard of it?

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.963
I have a novel on Africa.
'Shivering in Sahara'.

01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:32.429
That Africa!

01:13:32.935 --> 01:13:33.937
Then...

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.668
What if it was hyena?

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:39.068
A hyena?
- Yes.

01:13:39.599 --> 01:13:41.590
Instead of a wolf,
did you kill a hyena?

01:13:42.525 --> 01:13:45.167
What rubbish are you saying?
Hyenas are in China.

01:13:45.634 --> 01:13:48.020
I killed a wolf,
but you don't believe!

01:13:48.929 --> 01:13:50.294
There aren't wolves in Africa.

01:13:53.504 --> 01:13:55.205
Aren't there? Have you been there?

01:13:55.506 --> 01:13:57.386
No. I never went there.
Then how would you know?

01:13:57.708 --> 01:13:59.383
There are wolf preserves in Africa.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:12.763
Did you see that type
of cactus plant? Look at that.

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:16.825
It blossoms every Saturday.

01:14:18.213 --> 01:14:19.495
Every single Saturday!

01:14:20.751 --> 01:14:23.431
You do not know about this country,
yet you're arguing about Africa.

01:14:28.354 --> 01:14:29.651
Are you a parapsychologist?

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.328
Did you say something?

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.910
I don't think you had
a good sleep last night.

01:14:37.235 --> 01:14:40.481
I have to stay up late
to write notes, that's why.

01:14:42.309 --> 01:14:45.129
Well, I find it really interesting

01:14:45.585 --> 01:14:48.627
that hypnotism is used
in parapsychology.

01:14:49.154 --> 01:14:53.356
So, can new theories really
emerge through hypnotism?

01:14:53.871 --> 01:14:55.202
That's what they say.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.139
Do you know hypnotism?

01:14:58.782 --> 01:15:00.167
No, do you?

01:15:00.492 --> 01:15:01.981
Look! A peacock! A peacock!

01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:30.109
Won't you come out?

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:32.373
Actually, the peacocks are...

01:15:32.767 --> 01:15:33.824
Are you allergic?

01:15:35.736 --> 01:15:37.058
Look at this scar.

01:15:37.809 --> 01:15:40.354
I was at the zoo, holding
the wires of a peacock's cage.

01:15:40.782 --> 01:15:41.784
Did it bite you?

01:15:42.098 --> 01:15:43.316
Yes, 40 years ago.

01:15:45.595 --> 01:15:47.827
Wow! The national bird!

01:15:56.087 --> 01:15:58.278
There's one thing
I should warn you about.

01:15:59.287 --> 01:16:02.076
Keep an eye on Mr Globetrotter.

01:16:03.276 --> 01:16:04.908
I just want us
to be safe than sorry.

01:16:05.993 --> 01:16:07.850
I see.

01:16:08.712 --> 01:16:09.789
I'll keep that in mind.

01:16:11.178 --> 01:16:12.183
Mukul!

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:28.290
Why do you keep showing me
the wrong fort?

01:16:37.651 --> 01:16:38.657
Mukul,

01:16:39.651 --> 01:16:41.754
if you had told us
the name of the place,

01:16:42.623 --> 01:16:45.291
we would have
immediately taken you there.

01:16:45.973 --> 01:16:46.979
I'm hungry now.

01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:50.236
I kept telling you to eat,
but you did not.

01:16:50.601 --> 01:16:52.588
What's wrong? Is he sick?

01:16:53.179 --> 01:16:54.188
No, he's very sad.

01:16:54.874 --> 01:16:55.874
Why?

01:16:56.107 --> 01:16:57.507
He cannot find his golden fortress.

01:16:58.854 --> 01:17:00.053
Golden fortress?

01:17:00.225 --> 01:17:03.330
You all go look at it.
I'll feed him.

01:17:04.743 --> 01:17:06.604
Let's go. I'll tell you
everything while at the fort.

01:17:06.628 --> 01:17:08.716
I'll make everything
clear for you on this matter.

01:17:10.449 --> 01:17:11.543
Let's go, Mr Bose.

01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:14.807
You go ahead.
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:17:27.354 --> 01:17:29.980
They've built a fort
at every nook and cranny!

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.998
How much longer do you want to get
duped? Money is running out.

01:17:36.123 --> 01:17:37.282
What are you doing?

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:39.541
Why are they suspicious about you?
- Who is?

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:40.511
Who else? The detective.

01:17:40.646 --> 01:17:42.956
What have you done? - I didn't
make any mistake with him.

01:17:43.233 --> 01:17:46.590
Then where? - I didn't remember that
there were not wolves in Africa.

01:17:47.009 --> 01:17:48.969
I'll manage everything. Don't worry.

01:17:50.273 --> 01:17:51.286
We can't waste more time.

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:54.223
I understand that.
How are you going to hurry this?

01:18:00.577 --> 01:18:01.971
There's a way.

01:18:02.574 --> 01:18:07.447
Hypnotism can help
in recalling the past life.

01:18:08.007 --> 01:18:09.338
Will you hypnotise him?

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:15.079
I haven't done it in years.
So, I'm not sure.

01:18:15.423 --> 01:18:17.470
Don't think about that.
It's like riding a bicycle.

01:18:17.646 --> 01:18:19.686
Once you learn, you
can never forget how to ride it.

01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:22.367
Do it now.
Now, I'll manage the others.

01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:38.736
This is amazing! I had never
imagined that I'd meet someone

01:18:38.966 --> 01:18:43.306
who remembers his past life.
- That man is a parapsychologist!

01:18:44.203 --> 01:18:45.473
He is renowned.

01:18:46.497 --> 01:18:48.576
You can't guess it
by the way he looks.

01:18:49.399 --> 01:18:53.377
You don't look like
a suspense thriller writer either.

01:18:55.868 --> 01:18:57.518
You are just like a detective.

01:19:00.723 --> 01:19:03.604
One more thing! Highly suspicious!

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.287
There you are!
I was wondering where you were.

01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:08.911
How was my story?

01:19:08.946 --> 01:19:09.946
What story?

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800
The wolves.

01:19:13.069 --> 01:19:14.958
I was testing your knowledge.

01:19:15.398 --> 01:19:19.350
Well done! Not many people know
that there are no wolves in Africa.

01:19:19.707 --> 01:19:23.755
What say, Mr Mitter?
- Not many people except you and me.

01:19:24.034 --> 01:19:25.477
This man does.

01:19:26.033 --> 01:19:29.866
I need to read your book. Do you
have a copy of Kidnapping in Sahara?

01:19:30.731 --> 01:19:32.287
Kidnapping!

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:37.641
You are a very funny man!

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.987
Eat quickly. Eat quickly.

01:20:02.321 --> 01:20:04.152
Here. Wipe your face.

01:20:14.663 --> 01:20:17.530
Don't go too far.
I'll be in the car.

01:21:42.739 --> 01:21:43.739
Mukul.

01:21:51.305 --> 01:21:54.240
Open the door, open the door!

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.320
What's the matter?

01:21:56.421 --> 01:21:58.221
He was calling me.
- Who?

01:21:58.489 --> 01:22:01.671
The bad guy. - Which bad guy? Is he
from this life or your past life?

01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:17.910
I don't like this
whole situation, Topshe.

01:22:20.254 --> 01:22:21.442
I don't like it.

01:22:23.622 --> 01:22:24.947
A view

01:22:26.184 --> 01:22:28.299
is forming in my head

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.839
and then getting lost again.

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:44.895
There are some people.

01:22:46.901 --> 01:22:49.005
Some of them are wearing masks.

01:22:51.346 --> 01:22:52.762
Some are in a faint light

01:22:54.844 --> 01:22:55.924
and some are in the dark.

01:22:57.330 --> 01:22:58.691
One suspect is Mandar Bose.

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:03.012
Certainly. He is in
the mask of a globetrotter.

01:23:04.232 --> 01:23:07.622
Who is he really?
Is he one of those two people?

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.438
What about the man with bandages?

01:23:13.813 --> 01:23:15.984
He was spying
on the Circuit House at night.

01:23:17.838 --> 01:23:19.414
Is he the second con artist?

01:23:21.045 --> 01:23:22.365
Do they want the hidden treasure?

01:23:23.728 --> 01:23:26.216
Or is it someone else
with another motive?

01:23:27.732 --> 01:23:28.744
Who else?

01:23:29.601 --> 01:23:30.862
And Dr Hajra.

01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:48.667
Dr Hajra had exposed Bhabananda.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.301
However, is he also wearing one?

01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:56.378
In that car today,

01:23:57.829 --> 01:24:00.069
he was sitting next to a person,
who knows his past life.

01:24:00.683 --> 01:24:03.530
We could've seen
the golden fort within a few hours.

01:24:04.402 --> 01:24:06.052
Yet, he was dozing. Why?

01:24:09.561 --> 01:24:13.395
Probably, he's too frustrated now.

01:24:14.685 --> 01:24:16.235
Dr Hajra?

01:24:16.986 --> 01:24:18.430
Dr Hajra is the first person.

01:24:19.348 --> 01:24:21.468
There is someone else who is more
suspicious than him.

01:24:21.961 --> 01:24:22.963
Who?

01:24:23.325 --> 01:24:24.776
Mukul's bad guy.

01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:28.545
The one who feared camels

01:24:29.952 --> 01:24:31.182
and then vanished.

01:24:32.696 --> 01:24:33.936
Where did he go?

01:24:35.068 --> 01:24:36.253
When?

01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:39.374
Why did Mukul use the word vanish?

01:24:39.859 --> 01:24:41.412
Why can't we ask Mukul that?

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.115
Very good, Topshe.

01:24:46.265 --> 01:24:47.905
I was thinking the same thing.

01:24:50.134 --> 01:24:52.066
Besides, past life recollections,

01:24:53.211 --> 01:24:55.610
what else does this boy know?

01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:18.601
Can you tell me what this is, Mukul?

01:25:18.935 --> 01:25:19.938
A pen.

01:25:21.357 --> 01:25:23.142
And now?
- Light.

01:25:24.116 --> 01:25:25.728
If you look at this light,

01:25:26.048 --> 01:25:28.683
you can see the golden fort.

01:25:29.212 --> 01:25:30.214
Where is it?

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.166
See this light!

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:35.234
Inside this light!
- Where?

01:25:35.809 --> 01:25:38.366
Not here. Come with me.

01:25:41.719 --> 01:25:43.101
Come on.

01:25:44.263 --> 01:25:45.458
Come and sit here.

01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:52.461
Now

01:25:53.605 --> 01:25:55.711
I'll put this light on your face,

01:25:56.067 --> 01:25:59.470
and you'll stare at it. Okay?

01:26:01.225 --> 01:26:03.090
Will I be able to see
the golden fort then?

01:26:04.839 --> 01:26:06.352
Ready?
- Ready.

01:26:09.069 --> 01:26:13.024
Mukul, stare at the light.

01:26:13.849 --> 01:26:16.056
Keep staring at the light.

01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:21.632
Keep staring at the light.

01:26:23.662 --> 01:26:25.893
The golden fort.

01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:30.268
The golden fort.

01:26:31.837 --> 01:26:34.374
The golden fort.

01:26:35.976 --> 01:26:38.588
The golden fort.

01:26:40.201 --> 01:26:42.857
The golden fort.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.878
The golden fort.

01:26:48.755 --> 01:26:50.905
The golden fort.

01:26:52.693 --> 01:26:55.187
The golden fort.

01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:59.283
The golden fort.

01:27:19.505 --> 01:27:24.467
Mukul, can you hear me?

01:27:25.435 --> 01:27:27.076
Yes, I can.

01:27:29.813 --> 01:27:31.670
Where is your golden fort?

01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:34.207
What is the name of that place?

01:27:37.433 --> 01:27:38.620
Do you remember?

01:27:40.164 --> 01:27:42.013
Jai...

01:27:42.895 --> 01:27:44.169
Jaipur.
- Quiet.

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:49.168
Jai...

01:27:53.575 --> 01:27:54.581
Tell me!

01:27:56.284 --> 01:27:57.780
Jai...

01:27:58.731 --> 01:27:59.899
Sal...

01:28:01.333 --> 01:28:02.595
Mer.

01:28:04.423 --> 01:28:05.426
Turn on the lights.

01:28:11.143 --> 01:28:12.874
Jaisalmer.

01:28:12.908 --> 01:28:15.452
Jaisalmer.

01:28:15.678 --> 01:28:17.230
Jaisalmer! 320 km from here.

01:28:17.393 --> 01:28:18.993
There is a train.
- What time?

01:28:19.574 --> 01:28:22.634
9:45 am. That will
go to Pokhran. 130 km.

01:28:22.872 --> 01:28:24.763
We have to drive
the remaining distance.

01:28:24.887 --> 01:28:27.239
Why don't you just take
the car the whole way?

01:28:27.752 --> 01:28:29.779
No, you'll take the car.

01:28:30.079 --> 01:28:31.085
Me?
- Yes.

01:28:32.023 --> 01:28:33.204
Just listen to my plan.

01:28:33.798 --> 01:28:36.729
I'll tell them
that I wanted to rest for a day.

01:28:37.115 --> 01:28:39.792
They will take that opportunity
to visit Jodhpur Fort.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:43.836
I'll then go to the station
and you'll stay here.

01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:48.027
When they return, tell them Mukul
recalled the name of that place.

01:28:48.479 --> 01:28:51.683
That Dr Hajra took Mukul there.

01:28:52.348 --> 01:28:53.358
Where did they go?

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:54.841
Barmer. Will you remember?

01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:56.319
Barmer?
- Barmer.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.980
Should I send them to Barmer?
- They will leave on their own.

01:28:59.113 --> 01:29:01.944
What if they ask
why you didn't wait for them?

01:29:02.224 --> 01:29:04.089
Tell them Mukul was in a hurry.

01:29:05.008 --> 01:29:06.889
Okay, boss.
Then you'll leave at that time.

01:29:07.131 --> 01:29:08.913
Pokhran?
- Pokhran, in the taxi.

01:29:09.375 --> 01:29:11.016
I'll meet you there.
- You'll meet me there.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.727
Then we'll go to Jaisalmer.
- Jaisalmer.

01:29:12.771 --> 01:29:13.840
Okay, boss.

01:29:15.705 --> 01:29:18.161
Go and put the boy to bed.

01:29:18.712 --> 01:29:19.718
Go.

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:50.690
Mukul,

01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:53.422
can I click your photo?

01:30:05.583 --> 01:30:06.591
Good morning.

01:30:07.404 --> 01:30:08.998
Did you have breakfast?
- Yes.

01:30:09.772 --> 01:30:12.244
I wake up early.
I like to workout first.

01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:13.875
That's why, you look very fit.

01:30:14.511 --> 01:30:16.319
What are you doing today?
- Rest.

01:30:17.207 --> 01:30:19.013
Mukul needs that too.

01:30:19.984 --> 01:30:23.283
I need some time to
think about things too.

01:30:23.903 --> 01:30:25.234
Anything new?

01:30:26.346 --> 01:30:27.421
I was thinking

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:32.189
that camels, sand,
forts and peacocks...

01:30:32.805 --> 01:30:35.702
Could they not have been
in another country?

01:30:36.196 --> 01:30:37.208
What if they are?

01:30:37.397 --> 01:30:39.601
His past life may not
have been in India.

01:30:40.794 --> 01:30:43.126
I never even thought
about that before.

01:30:46.673 --> 01:30:50.789
I wanted to speak
to Mukul some time today.

01:30:51.131 --> 01:30:54.566
Alright. You are going out, right?
We will talk after you return.

01:30:55.356 --> 01:30:57.476
I have been wondering about
something since yesterday.

01:30:58.555 --> 01:31:01.088
Why is your research
based on such strange things?

01:31:01.858 --> 01:31:03.770
This country
is full of superstitions.

01:31:04.197 --> 01:31:06.513
Do you think rebirth
should be discussed here?

01:31:07.323 --> 01:31:11.019
Soon, many young boys will
claim to recall their past lives.

01:31:11.244 --> 01:31:13.138
How many boys will you
take through the country?

01:31:19.936 --> 01:31:22.144
Good morning!
- Don't let him go.

01:31:22.357 --> 01:31:23.515
What?
- Let's go out.

01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:25.658
In this?
- Yes.

01:31:25.699 --> 01:31:27.296
Please wait.

01:31:27.537 --> 01:31:29.371
I'm also leaving for Jaipur.

01:31:29.786 --> 01:31:32.145
Leaving?
- Yes, this place is too dry for me.

01:31:47.775 --> 01:31:50.510
Topshe, keep an eye on the road.

01:31:52.075 --> 01:31:53.085
Why, Felu?

01:31:53.352 --> 01:31:56.685
If you see a man covered in
a red shawl, tell me immediately.

01:31:58.357 --> 01:31:59.586
What's going on?

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:03.324
We are looking for mysteries,
just like you.

01:32:04.395 --> 01:32:05.924
I see, a mystery!

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:17.379
I've always wanted to be involved

01:32:18.124 --> 01:32:21.729
in a real mystery
with a real detective.

01:32:25.196 --> 01:32:26.836
That probably won't happen.

01:32:29.499 --> 01:32:32.251
Mr Das speaking?
Das is not there?

01:32:33.432 --> 01:32:34.469
What?

01:32:34.885 --> 01:32:36.078
Dr Hajra?

01:32:37.478 --> 01:32:38.484
I see.

01:32:39.223 --> 01:32:40.591
I see. Thank you.

01:32:43.578 --> 01:32:46.610
None of the people you mentioned
is at Circuit House.

01:32:47.521 --> 01:32:49.898
There was a small boy, who
left Circuit House with Dr Hajra.

01:32:49.963 --> 01:32:51.946
No one knows where they went.

01:32:52.891 --> 01:32:53.894
My God!

01:32:55.778 --> 01:32:58.251
Look, I am Dr Hajra!

01:33:00.571 --> 01:33:03.125
He's an imposter! A criminal!

01:33:03.827 --> 01:33:07.110
I'm a renowned parapsychologist.

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:10.049
What?
- Do you know what telepathy is?

01:33:11.065 --> 01:33:12.557
Telepathy?
- Yes.

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:14.469
No, sir.

01:33:14.667 --> 01:33:16.311
Hypnosis?
- No, sir.

01:33:17.199 --> 01:33:19.424
Telephone, yes.
Telegraph, yes.

01:33:20.065 --> 01:33:22.553
Telescope, yes.
Teleprinter, yes.

01:33:22.982 --> 01:33:25.327
But no telepathy.
- I see.

01:33:28.297 --> 01:33:29.654
Tell me something, sir.

01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:31.973
What?

01:33:32.466 --> 01:33:35.004
Was there ever a war in Jaisalmer?

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.720
The guide books don't mention that.

01:33:37.982 --> 01:33:40.837
But I need to find out about it.

01:33:42.259 --> 01:33:44.625
I know there was.
It was a long time ago.

01:33:45.244 --> 01:33:47.766
Alauddin Khilji attacked Jaisalmer.

01:33:52.826 --> 01:33:55.581
Look at the beautiful stone pottery!

01:33:57.266 --> 01:33:59.309
Have you ever seen
this yellow stones?

01:34:00.063 --> 01:34:01.063
Stop!

01:34:11.655 --> 01:34:14.030
Show me the yellow bowl
on your window.

01:34:14.199 --> 01:34:15.874
The small one?
- Yes, that's the one.

01:34:23.593 --> 01:34:24.599
Beautiful!

01:34:25.566 --> 01:34:27.811
These are quite solid!
How much for these?

01:34:28.232 --> 01:34:29.767
Rs 25 for this.

01:34:30.888 --> 01:34:32.011
Where did you get this from?

01:34:32.036 --> 01:34:35.005
This is from Jaisalmer.
It's great quality. Please take it.

01:34:36.461 --> 01:34:37.560
Jaisalmer?

01:34:39.504 --> 01:34:41.369
Yellow limestone.

01:34:42.756 --> 01:34:44.025
Lal Mohan, let's go.

01:34:59.183 --> 01:35:02.404
Where are you going?
That room is locked.

01:35:02.938 --> 01:35:06.066
What?
- They left almost an hour ago.

01:35:06.825 --> 01:35:07.584
Where to?

01:35:07.646 --> 01:35:11.104
The child remembered the place.
I've written on this paper.

01:35:14.763 --> 01:35:18.775
B A R M E R.

01:35:19.282 --> 01:35:21.008
Barmer?
- Exactly!

01:35:21.539 --> 01:35:22.877
I haven't heard that name before.

01:35:24.421 --> 01:35:25.918
Why did they leave in such a hurry?

01:35:26.072 --> 01:35:27.668
The child became restless

01:35:28.675 --> 01:35:31.471
and even ripped off
the sleeve on his shirt.

01:35:33.524 --> 01:35:34.646
Barmer?

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:40.805
He told me to tell you to follow him
immediately. He's waiting for you.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.105
I have been waiting for you.
My car just arrived too.

01:35:54.228 --> 01:35:55.378
The boy has left!

01:36:12.572 --> 01:36:14.422
What's wrong? You seem...

01:36:26.833 --> 01:36:28.042
Do you want to have some?

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:45.837
A bowl made of golden stone.

01:37:16.265 --> 01:37:18.040
Can you show me
the guest record book please?

01:37:27.858 --> 01:37:28.947
Oh my God!

01:37:30.612 --> 01:37:32.486
I need a taxi to Jaisalmer and back.

01:37:35.946 --> 01:37:38.586
Topshe, tell them we need three
packed lunches within half an hour.

01:37:49.186 --> 01:37:52.457
Let's find out
how strong Felu Mitter's

01:37:54.584 --> 01:37:55.901
telepathy is.

01:37:57.879 --> 01:38:02.377
Let's find out how smart
Bhabananda is.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.566
Earthquake.

01:38:07.647 --> 01:38:08.697
Floods.

01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:10.661
Storm.

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.070
This doesn't fit into anything.

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:16.781
Oh no!

01:38:18.389 --> 01:38:20.694
Topshe, pack your luggage.

01:38:26.279 --> 01:38:28.260
Mr Lal Mohan...
- Yes?

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.793
You have done me
a huge favour by guiding me

01:38:32.563 --> 01:38:34.288
towards the bowl
made with golden stone.

01:38:34.917 --> 01:38:38.851
So, I'm giving you a chance
to fulfil your hearty wish.

01:38:39.522 --> 01:38:40.538
Okay.

01:38:47.916 --> 01:38:50.226
How long will it take you
to pack your bags?

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:51.758
Three minutes.

01:38:52.338 --> 01:38:53.338
Three!

01:38:53.736 --> 01:38:54.744
Oh no!

01:38:55.171 --> 01:38:57.158
I'll tell you everything
when the time is right.

01:38:58.483 --> 01:38:59.583
But for now,

01:39:00.632 --> 01:39:02.126
you can't ask questions.

01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:09.630
Could you give me your word?

01:39:10.508 --> 01:39:11.521
Sure.

01:39:12.383 --> 01:39:13.391
Yes.

01:39:24.767 --> 01:39:27.309
Oh, so you are planning
to go to Jaisalmer!

01:39:29.121 --> 01:39:31.703
I won't let you go.

01:39:35.022 --> 01:39:37.646
Can I ask where we're going?

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:39.152
Jaisalmer.

01:39:40.611 --> 01:39:42.507
It was the capital of Bhati Kingdom.

01:39:43.242 --> 01:39:46.706
800 year-old fort stands
in the middle of Thar Desert.

01:39:49.090 --> 01:39:51.123
The bowl you found
is made of the same

01:39:51.617 --> 01:39:53.904
golden stone that the
palace was made from.

01:39:54.769 --> 01:39:56.376
So, we can conclude

01:39:56.401 --> 01:39:59.337
that only one palace in Rajasthan
can be known as the golden fort.

01:40:00.486 --> 01:40:02.036
And my firm belief...

01:40:09.143 --> 01:40:11.183
I am here to give a tip to Mr Mitter
before I leave.

01:40:12.026 --> 01:40:13.870
Go on. A man...

01:40:14.535 --> 01:40:16.817
Doubt any man who is
under 5 feet 6 inches.

01:40:17.853 --> 01:40:18.863
I'll see you then.

01:40:19.339 --> 01:40:20.807
Do you know what I think?

01:40:22.207 --> 01:40:23.207
What?

01:40:23.679 --> 01:40:24.759
We'll see each other again.

01:40:26.526 --> 01:40:29.301
I'll be extremely overjoyed
if that happens. Bye, Mr Mitter.

01:40:30.088 --> 01:40:31.438
Bye, Jatayu.

01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:36.501
Brazilian scorpion.

01:40:39.242 --> 01:40:42.466
Brazilian scorpion.
Let me write that down

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.784
Brazilian scorpion.

01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:21.981
Lal Mohan, look! There's a camel!

01:41:28.493 --> 01:41:31.653
Can I ask you a question
about camels? - Sure.

01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:35.772
Are these wild camels?

01:41:36.742 --> 01:41:37.753
Probably not.

01:41:40.086 --> 01:41:41.172
What do they eat then?

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.951
Plants with thorns.

01:41:45.918 --> 01:41:47.420
Do they take out the thorns?

01:41:48.949 --> 01:41:49.961
No.

01:42:02.828 --> 01:42:06.848
I won't ask a question,
but I have something to say.

01:42:07.257 --> 01:42:08.878
May I?
- Say it.

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:15.306
If we are going to experience
a life threatening situation,

01:42:16.123 --> 01:42:18.949
I hope you have a weapon
for self-defence.

01:42:20.235 --> 01:42:22.635
That's because mine is stolen.

01:42:23.466 --> 01:42:25.137
Who took it?

01:42:27.054 --> 01:42:30.923
One of the innumerable bandits
of this bandit infested country.

01:42:34.219 --> 01:42:35.237
I just

01:42:41.701 --> 01:42:44.139
have this left with me.

01:42:45.005 --> 01:42:48.609
I could've told that bandit that
the sheath is equally expensive.

01:42:50.022 --> 01:42:52.285
Hence, if you are in trouble...

01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:03.656
Are your tires old?

01:43:04.076 --> 01:43:06.168
Come and see the condition.

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:37.233
Yes, I have a telepathic power!

01:43:38.139 --> 01:43:41.683
We came in the right direction, and
that's why someone wants to stop us!

01:43:42.188 --> 01:43:45.326
This is our opportunity.
Topshe, let's move these!

01:43:52.876 --> 01:43:54.470
Mr Singh, please drive carefully.

01:43:54.924 --> 01:43:57.258
Another tire puncture
will cause us problems.

01:43:59.427 --> 01:44:00.935
No questions.

01:44:01.686 --> 01:44:02.957
No questions.

01:44:04.526 --> 01:44:06.082
No questions.

01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:12.870
Mr Lal Mohan?

01:44:14.094 --> 01:44:15.614
Two extremely

01:44:16.415 --> 01:44:19.666
dangerous men
have taken Mukul to Jaisalmer,

01:44:20.514 --> 01:44:21.904
in the hope of finding a treasure.

01:44:23.307 --> 01:44:25.153
When we reach there,

01:44:26.402 --> 01:44:29.327
we may have to fight with them.

01:44:31.795 --> 01:44:34.141
If you're up for the challenge,

01:44:35.304 --> 01:44:39.428
then your next book can
be about this adventure.

01:44:43.748 --> 01:44:45.927
Now may I ask you question?

01:44:47.222 --> 01:44:48.238
Yes, you may.

01:44:49.239 --> 01:44:50.482
Are you a detective?

01:44:55.026 --> 01:44:56.045
Yes,

01:44:57.482 --> 01:45:00.435
but I'm nothing like Prakhar Rudra.

01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:06.891
Private investigator!

01:45:08.821 --> 01:45:11.347
And Topesh Ranjan is my assistant.

01:45:21.126 --> 01:45:24.118
Are we now chasing bandits now?

01:45:26.243 --> 01:45:27.541
Bandits, yes.

01:45:29.086 --> 01:45:31.227
But they aren't from Aravalli,
but from Kolkata.

01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:41.711
If you are even a little hesitant,

01:45:42.767 --> 01:45:45.421
we can drop you at Pokhran.

01:45:45.616 --> 01:45:47.275
Why?
- You'll get a train there.

01:45:48.753 --> 01:45:49.757
You want me to go back!

01:45:50.086 --> 01:45:51.600
I'm telling you
there is danger ahead.

01:45:52.074 --> 01:45:53.091
Danger?

01:45:56.585 --> 01:45:58.362
You're trying to scare me!

01:45:59.965 --> 01:46:01.127
I'm Jatayu!

01:46:06.599 --> 01:46:07.795
Mr Singh!

01:46:23.199 --> 01:46:24.689
Who did this?

01:46:25.364 --> 01:46:28.482
Who gathered this many shards of
glass and put them on the road?

01:46:29.484 --> 01:46:31.214
Why don't you guess?

01:46:34.379 --> 01:46:35.389
Felu!

01:46:37.227 --> 01:46:38.747
There are no cities
or villages around.

01:46:41.048 --> 01:46:42.431
No train line either.

01:46:43.311 --> 01:46:46.107
We wouldn't have caught the train.
They have reached Pokhran by now.

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:47.588
It could run late though.

01:46:48.332 --> 01:46:49.335
Mr Singh!

01:46:49.847 --> 01:46:52.223
If another taxi comes, can
we get a spare tire from them?

01:46:52.397 --> 01:46:55.724
Yes, but not too many cars
drive on this road.

01:46:56.277 --> 01:46:58.056
Where is the nearest train station?

01:46:58.477 --> 01:47:00.668
Ramdeora is around 11-12 km.

01:47:02.359 --> 01:47:03.919
Are you thinking
about a train at night?

01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:07.497
The night train
reaches Ramdeora at 3 am.

01:47:08.516 --> 01:47:12.612
If we wait at the station, the taxi
can come come and meet us there.

01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:15.333
Or we can catch the train.

01:47:15.392 --> 01:47:16.933
What time will we reach Jaisalmer?

01:47:17.825 --> 01:47:19.156
At 7:30 in the morning.

01:47:19.448 --> 01:47:20.704
Do you want to go to Ramdeora?

01:47:21.451 --> 01:47:23.811
Unless the car is fixed, we'll
have to catch a train, right?

01:47:24.118 --> 01:47:26.776
Do you want to ride on camels? Look!

01:47:36.358 --> 01:47:39.244
Yes, stop them.
- Hey! Stop!

01:47:41.783 --> 01:47:44.037
So, Mr Jatayu,
do you want to ride a camel?

01:47:44.606 --> 01:47:45.739
Camel?
- Yes.

01:47:45.819 --> 01:47:47.147
Wow.

01:47:47.398 --> 01:47:51.074
I never thought all of my dreams
would come true like this.

01:47:51.362 --> 01:47:53.393
It is the power of telepathy.
Get ready!

01:47:54.081 --> 01:47:57.101
I wish I could be
an Arabian camel rider.

01:48:35.486 --> 01:48:37.552
Make sure you know
how to get on the camel.

01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:42.695
They fold the front legs

01:48:43.289 --> 01:48:44.945
and then the hind legs.

01:48:45.367 --> 01:48:46.868
And when they get up, it's reverse.

01:48:47.266 --> 01:48:50.862
Remember that, and you won't have
problems.

01:48:51.285 --> 01:48:52.662
Watch me. I'm getting on.

01:48:56.273 --> 01:48:57.296
Topshe, get on.

01:49:08.623 --> 01:49:10.230
Are you okay?
- Great!

01:49:10.562 --> 01:49:13.180
Lal Mohan, get on. It's very easy.

01:49:31.566 --> 01:49:32.931
Are you okay?

01:49:33.756 --> 01:49:34.768
Let's go to Ramdeora.

01:49:40.835 --> 01:49:44.017
Mr.Singh, once the tires are fixed,
meet us quickly.

01:49:44.442 --> 01:49:46.898
Sure thing! I will!

01:50:02.731 --> 01:50:04.156
This is fun, Felu!

01:50:05.548 --> 01:50:06.977
Make sure he's okay behind you.

01:50:13.444 --> 01:50:14.808
Mr Lal Mohan!

01:50:15.615 --> 01:50:16.658
Yes?

01:50:17.741 --> 01:50:19.920
What is your dream telling you?

01:50:20.351 --> 01:50:22.482
It's telling me this is reality.

01:50:25.212 --> 01:50:26.597
Where you are sitting...

01:50:26.942 --> 01:50:27.842
Yes?

01:50:27.886 --> 01:50:30.209
That hump contains
camel's supply of water.

01:50:30.548 --> 01:50:32.384
What will become of me
riding this camel?

01:50:33.746 --> 01:50:35.917
Do you need a hump too?

01:50:36.173 --> 01:50:38.204
I need water!

01:50:38.424 --> 01:50:39.937
I'm thirsty.

01:51:08.249 --> 01:51:09.682
Felu! Train!

01:51:15.296 --> 01:51:17.859
Turn around.
We have to stop that train.

01:51:57.805 --> 01:51:59.236
Look! It's them!

01:52:13.958 --> 01:52:17.001
Wonderful. Let's go to Ramdeora.

01:52:37.749 --> 01:52:39.112
What happened?
- Why?

01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:40.972
I saw them on the camels.

01:52:41.491 --> 01:52:43.016
Oh no! He is so dangerous!

01:52:43.497 --> 01:52:45.770
I told them to go to Barmer.
Yet, they are going to Jaisalmer.

01:52:45.794 --> 01:52:49.641
Look. I think they are going
to Ramdeora, the previous station.

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:52.072
They'll catch the night train.

01:52:52.679 --> 01:52:53.716
Understand?

01:52:54.041 --> 01:52:55.999
I'll drop you there.

01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.499
Finish your job
and see me in Jaisalmer.

01:52:58.786 --> 01:53:00.827
You mean, kill them, right?

01:53:11.253 --> 01:53:12.280
Okay.

01:53:14.137 --> 01:53:16.373
Hold on! One minute!
- What's the matter?

01:53:16.971 --> 01:53:17.971
Listen!

01:53:18.096 --> 01:53:19.915
Give me some money,
my pockets are empty!

01:53:20.198 --> 01:53:21.758
The glass bottles
cost me all the money.

01:53:21.876 --> 01:53:23.010
I need to eat dinner.

01:53:23.927 --> 01:53:25.679
Eat?
- Yes! Solid food.

01:53:26.554 --> 01:53:27.561
What about drinks?

01:53:28.973 --> 01:53:29.983
Energy drinks only.

01:53:33.049 --> 01:53:34.088
Don't forget.

01:53:34.853 --> 01:53:36.496
Don't mention.

01:53:47.994 --> 01:53:49.209
Try to get up.

01:53:50.065 --> 01:53:51.309
Get up.

01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:53.930
Give me your hand.

01:53:55.036 --> 01:53:57.576
Come on, stand up.

01:53:58.239 --> 01:53:59.951
Good job! Get up!

01:54:00.997 --> 01:54:03.413
There we go! Very good!

01:54:03.994 --> 01:54:06.349
What happened?
Did you get a hump too?

01:54:06.548 --> 01:54:08.287
No, I'm feeling fine now.

01:54:08.881 --> 01:54:11.067
Here, eat some sweets.
- Let me recover some more.

01:54:11.423 --> 01:54:12.480
Here, Topshe.

01:54:16.219 --> 01:54:18.656
Topshe, keep an eye on the road.

01:54:19.009 --> 01:54:20.088
For the taxi, right?

01:54:20.337 --> 01:54:22.057
If you see headlights,
immediately go there.

01:55:06.227 --> 01:55:07.857
This experience I'm
gaining couldn't even

01:55:08.451 --> 01:55:10.244
compare to any of
my adventure stories.

01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:15.839
Are you saying your
experiences are over?

01:55:16.089 --> 01:55:17.540
No, there are no more camels though.

01:55:18.184 --> 01:55:19.728
That's right.
- Then?

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:23.961
Nothing compares to camels.
Dangerous animals.

01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:29.543
Eat this. This is what
Aravalli bandits eat.

01:55:36.005 --> 01:55:37.621
If I had my weapon now...

01:55:38.471 --> 01:55:39.631
Are you listening, Mr Mitter?

01:55:40.434 --> 01:55:41.664
I'd feel safe.

01:55:43.334 --> 01:55:45.083
That was a very nice dagger.

01:55:46.379 --> 01:55:48.673
Does the detective you
write about use daggers?

01:55:50.505 --> 01:55:51.630
Prakhar Rudra?

01:55:53.616 --> 01:55:54.677
Ask him.

01:55:56.431 --> 01:55:58.377
So? Topshe?

01:55:59.135 --> 01:56:00.508
Revolver.

01:56:07.086 --> 01:56:10.550
What kind of revolver does he use?

01:56:10.885 --> 01:56:12.700
A revolver is a revolver,

01:56:12.725 --> 01:56:15.296
it has 6 bullets. Bang!

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.283
Like this?

01:56:26.095 --> 01:56:28.206
This is a Colt .32.

01:56:31.453 --> 01:56:32.499
Is this loaded?

01:56:36.628 --> 01:56:39.267
This is where
the bullets are loaded. Bang!

01:56:41.247 --> 01:56:42.266
This is the trigger.

01:56:43.817 --> 01:56:44.829
This is the hammer.

01:56:46.204 --> 01:56:47.557
There are many other makes.

01:56:47.995 --> 01:56:50.689
Different bores and calibres.

01:56:51.226 --> 01:56:52.248
Really?

01:56:53.105 --> 01:56:54.698
You should know this.

01:56:55.511 --> 01:56:58.660
Otherwise, you may write
about a camel's stomach again.

01:56:59.610 --> 01:57:00.629
Mr Jatayu!

01:59:11.695 --> 01:59:14.764
Lal Mohan, please get up.
Topshe, the train has arrived.

01:59:48.285 --> 01:59:49.995
Topshe, Lal Mohan, get in.

01:59:57.089 --> 01:59:58.120
Oh no!

01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:59.776
Where are the lights?

02:00:01.249 --> 02:00:03.911
The lights aren't working, Felu.

02:00:05.553 --> 02:00:07.089
There aren't any bulbs.
- Bandits!

02:00:07.449 --> 02:00:09.312
Lal Mohan, look at that wall.

02:00:09.518 --> 02:00:11.016
There might be a switch.

02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.478
Is there?
- Yes.

02:00:14.218 --> 02:00:15.232
Yes, got it.

02:00:16.214 --> 02:00:17.720
Wonderful. Night light?

02:00:18.127 --> 02:00:19.339
This will do.

02:00:19.674 --> 02:00:22.708
Topshe, open the beds and sleep.

02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:26.203
Lalmohan and you sleep in this side.
I'm going to the other side.

02:00:26.536 --> 02:00:29.454
I can go to that side.
- Just do as I say.

02:00:30.096 --> 02:00:32.115
I'll sleep here.
- No, sir.

02:00:33.181 --> 02:00:35.936
He'll get up early in the morning
and do Yoga. - There's Yoga.

02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:39.686
But if someone disturbs us,
I'll take care of that too.

02:00:40.037 --> 02:00:44.469
Wow! Your life is so exciting!

02:00:54.521 --> 02:00:56.523
After I saw your weapon,

02:00:57.429 --> 02:00:59.418
I'm feeling much more protected.

02:01:07.517 --> 02:01:09.173
Oh no. There's no lock?

02:01:09.792 --> 02:01:11.744
It must be the bandits.

02:04:14.147 --> 02:04:16.738
What happened?

02:04:18.295 --> 02:04:23.032
Bhabananda's disciple.
Now your game is over.

02:04:23.768 --> 02:04:26.526
Get up! Get up!

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:28.482
Come on.

02:04:29.207 --> 02:04:31.917
Hands up. Hands up!

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:35.660
Back up!

02:04:37.099 --> 02:04:38.939
Do you know what kind
of punishment you'll get?

02:04:39.823 --> 02:04:43.173
3 months jail
and then you'll be hanged.

02:04:45.672 --> 02:04:46.718
Now tell us.

02:04:47.925 --> 02:04:49.605
What happened at Nahargarh fort?

02:04:51.545 --> 02:04:52.558
Tell us.

02:04:54.495 --> 02:04:58.800
We have four hours.
There is no hurry. Take your time.

02:05:01.837 --> 02:05:03.115
What are you doing?

02:05:28.029 --> 02:05:29.349
He went into another compartment.

02:05:31.781 --> 02:05:32.785
So, Jatayu?

02:05:34.951 --> 02:05:38.345
A companion like you
leads to disaster only.

02:05:39.873 --> 02:05:43.299
Our enemy is quite strong.

02:05:47.979 --> 02:05:48.979
So?

02:05:49.307 --> 02:05:52.379
Are there bandits
in Rajasthan or not?

02:05:54.511 --> 02:05:56.737
The night isn't over yet.

02:05:57.655 --> 02:05:59.467
You don't know
what Mandar Bose is capable of.

02:06:03.608 --> 02:06:06.404
Who's there? Get out of the room.

02:06:07.017 --> 02:06:08.173
It's reserved.

02:06:16.332 --> 02:06:17.884
Hey, you!

02:06:24.017 --> 02:06:25.192
Close it!

02:06:29.796 --> 02:06:30.840
Yes!

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.086
Aren't you Mr Das?

02:06:54.623 --> 02:06:56.682
Or is that your alias?

02:06:59.635 --> 02:07:00.776
Don't you recognise me?

02:07:04.847 --> 02:07:07.844
We've known each other for
a long time. Since Allahabad

02:07:09.652 --> 02:07:11.127
in 1962,

02:07:12.626 --> 02:07:13.671
do you remember?

02:07:16.559 --> 02:07:17.815
Who is screaming?

02:07:20.497 --> 02:07:21.955
Hopefully, the problem is solved.

02:07:32.297 --> 02:07:33.371
Topshe,

02:07:38.109 --> 02:07:39.250
this is the golden fort.

02:07:41.741 --> 02:07:44.041
Lal Mohan, get up!

02:07:44.659 --> 02:07:46.401
Camels!

02:07:46.782 --> 02:07:48.877
Get up! We're in Jaisalmer.
- Oh! We're here?

02:08:03.508 --> 02:08:04.668
You wait here.

02:08:09.075 --> 02:08:10.075
Come on.

02:08:13.885 --> 02:08:14.954
Dr Hajra?

02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:22.238
This is my card.

02:08:24.834 --> 02:08:27.200
And this is Sudhir's letter for you.

02:08:35.793 --> 02:08:38.074
Let's go to the waiting room
and I'll tell you everything.

02:08:38.203 --> 02:08:40.530
We want to hear your story too.
- And Mukul?

02:08:41.195 --> 02:08:44.821
He's probably somewhere
around this golden fort.

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:50.202
A taxi is supposed to pick us up.
Let's wait for that.

02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:52.257
There is no other transportation.

02:08:54.041 --> 02:08:55.204
I must say something.

02:08:56.232 --> 02:08:59.046
When it comes to taking Mukul
back home safe and sound,

02:08:59.753 --> 02:09:01.113
you and I are equally responsible.

02:09:08.195 --> 02:09:09.821
Do you recall this, Mukul?

02:09:10.396 --> 02:09:11.396
The golden fort!

02:09:12.745 --> 02:09:14.437
And your house? Where is it?

02:09:14.981 --> 02:09:17.784
There is a city inside the fort.

02:09:18.126 --> 02:09:20.347
Really? Okay, let's go.

02:09:31.521 --> 02:09:32.641
There is no hidden treasure!

02:09:33.471 --> 02:09:36.392
How do you know?
- I've written in my notebook.

02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:39.340
Mukul said,
his father was a gem cutter.

02:09:40.318 --> 02:09:43.171
That's the reason
he saw expensive gemstones.

02:09:43.222 --> 02:09:44.522
That's quite obvious.

02:09:48.202 --> 02:09:49.202
Mukul!

02:10:00.587 --> 02:10:01.682
Mukul!

02:10:13.368 --> 02:10:16.094
What are you doing up there? Mukul!

02:10:16.538 --> 02:10:18.799
Come down!

02:10:23.851 --> 02:10:26.495
There was a temple. A temple!

02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:39.610
Mr Singh! Mr Singh! Stop!

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:50.438
Felu, the cab is here.

02:10:53.856 --> 02:10:55.061
We're leaving now, Dr Hajra.

02:10:55.429 --> 02:10:59.297
Our belongings are with you.
Get some rest. - Mukul!

02:10:59.547 --> 02:11:03.235
I just wish that Mukul
comes back safely.

02:11:03.551 --> 02:11:04.551
Good bye.

02:11:06.597 --> 02:11:10.465
One more thing.
This might be helpful to you.

02:11:10.762 --> 02:11:11.922
This belonged to Mandar Bose.

02:11:14.923 --> 02:11:17.135
This is mine!

02:11:22.079 --> 02:11:23.473
The temple.

02:11:23.833 --> 02:11:25.385
And your house? Your house?

02:11:33.003 --> 02:11:34.353
This is Ratan's house.

02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:37.523
And this is Giridhari's house.

02:11:39.066 --> 02:11:40.711
We used to play Holi here.

02:11:43.458 --> 02:11:44.468
This is the road.

02:11:44.904 --> 02:11:47.381
What road?
- The road to our house.

02:11:48.303 --> 02:11:49.994
Which one is your house?

02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:52.998
Over there, on the right side.

02:11:53.422 --> 02:11:54.494
Let's go then.

02:12:08.254 --> 02:12:12.208
Why are you scaring it?
Why are you scaring the peacock?

02:12:12.233 --> 02:12:17.121
Go away! Go away!

02:12:23.518 --> 02:12:25.292
Don't kill it!

02:12:30.591 --> 02:12:32.991
You are bad! You are a bad man!

02:12:33.685 --> 02:12:36.297
Mukul! Mukul!

02:12:45.504 --> 02:12:46.563
May I come with you?

02:12:47.033 --> 02:12:48.048
Sure.

02:12:56.129 --> 02:12:57.281
Mukul!

02:12:58.787 --> 02:12:59.950
Mukul!

02:13:06.627 --> 02:13:08.946
Topshe, you go cover this side.
I'll be over here.

02:13:46.954 --> 02:13:49.397
Mukul!

02:13:50.847 --> 02:13:52.391
Mukul!

02:14:10.653 --> 02:14:11.743
Good job, Topshe!

02:14:13.896 --> 02:14:16.340
You've wasted your time, Bhabananda.

02:14:16.971 --> 02:14:18.256
There is no hidden treasure,

02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:22.656
whether there is a past life or not.

02:14:24.041 --> 02:14:26.142
Mr Singh, catch him.

02:14:26.661 --> 02:14:28.821
Let's take him to the police
station. - Very good, sir.

02:14:39.788 --> 02:14:42.804
Topshe, look!
That man is being carried away!

02:14:49.374 --> 02:14:51.820
Get down, Mukul, we have to go now.

02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:54.164
Where are we going?

02:14:55.807 --> 02:14:57.138
Where do you want to go?

02:15:00.512 --> 02:15:03.041
I want to go home, to Kolkata.

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:09.108
I'll be going there too.
I have to write my 28th book.

02:15:09.958 --> 02:15:11.496
Felu, Topshe!

02:15:12.148 --> 02:15:13.605
We're all going back to Kolkata.

02:15:14.289 --> 02:15:18.520
Topshe, Lal Mohan, you and I.

02:15:19.232 --> 02:15:21.876
We'll take you back home safely.
