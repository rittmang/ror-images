'BHANU WINS THE LOTTERY'

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.201
Hey! Why are you wearing
tight clothing?

00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:07.281
Tight clothing?

00:04:11.841 --> 00:04:16.561
No, this is not tight clothing.
These are called trousers, got it?

00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:19.241
Trousers? - Yes. - Rubbish!
This looks like a pillow cover.

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.521
No, it's not!

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:25.441
These are trousers,
worn by the British. Got it?

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.561
Well, if you say so. - Yes..
- Although you studied

00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:31.641
in an ordinary school,
you're very clever

00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:34.441
and I am equally shrewd.
- Yes.

00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.241
Mukto! Hey, Mukto!
Jahar is here!

00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:40.801
Coming!

00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:46.921
Oh, dear! Why does he call me
in front of strangers?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.201
Strange!
Mitali, you couldn't recognise me!

00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:55.401
Oh, dear! What a surprise!
It's you, Mr. Jahar!

00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:05.001
Oh, God! Why are you wearing tight
clothing like police officers?

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:08.241
What the heck!
Don't talk like an idiot!

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.281
Their trousers are short.
They barely cover the knees.

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:14.601
Jahar is wearing
full-length trousers.

00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:19.401
This is what pops into the head
when you don't get married.

00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:23.961
How right you are!
I did ask him to get married

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.441
but no..
He is flirting with a city girl!

00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:29.881
Bhanu! What are you doing?
Not in front of Mitali..

00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:34.441
Well, Mr. Jahar, what does
the girl look like? - Excellent!

00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:36.721
Jahar, show her the photo.

00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:40.241
Oh, feeling shy, are you?
Show her. Go on..

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:48.841
She's beautiful.
- They'll make a nice pair, right?

00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:52.721
Yes, without a doubt!
What's her name?

00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.841
Mini..
- Mini? - Yes..

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:57.401
What kind of name is that?

00:05:58.001 --> 00:05:59.841
Her name is Mini Mitra.

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:03.041
It's been shortened to Mini.

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:03.041
It's been shortened to Mini.

00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:08.761
Well, fine.
Now, marry her.. - No..

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.481
That's not possible as long
as Haladhar Halder is alive.

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:15.721
Who's Hollow?
- Not Hollow. It's Haladhar Halder.

00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:17.321
He works as an agent
in the film industry.

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:20.081
Because of him, Mini is possessed
by the idea of acting in films.

00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:21.521
Possessed?

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:24.961
By what?

00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:29.321
A ghost, a demon

00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:33.681
a witch?
What the..

00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.841
Oh, let it go.
Forget it.

00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:39.481
Guess what I've got for you
from Kolkata!

00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.201
I know.
- Tell me then.

00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:45.841
It's a confectionery wrapped in
paper. - What! - What is it called?

00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:47.401
Toffee..
- Toffee?

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:52.481
No, you're wrong..
Okay, Mitali, you make a guess.

00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:57.961
Black tobacco.
You brought that again, right?

00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:01.041
Black tobacco?
- Yes!

00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:01.041
Black tobacco?
- Yes!

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:05.521
We had it with some milk and sugar.

00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:09.241
Coffee!
God, it smells ridiculous!

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.041
Coffee smells ridiculous..

00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:19.361
No.. Wrong again. This time,
I've brought a ticket for you.

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:23.041
Ticket? - Yes.
From the Luck Velky Lottery draw

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.521
priced at Rs. 2.
If luck favours you

00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:31.521
you'll win Rs. 3.95 lakhs
in the next 24 hours.

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:36.081
Rs. 3.95 lakhs..

00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:38.041
Please tell me how much it will be
in terms of twenty-rupee notes.

00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:39.801
In that case, if you stack
all the twenty-rupee notes

00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:41.201
it will be high enough
to take you to heaven.

00:07:41.281 --> 00:07:42.841
Rubbish!
You'll show me heaven, will you?

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.681
Why would I go to heaven
leaving Mukto here?

00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:49.481
I won't buy the ticket.
- You won't? - No..

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.481
Why didn't you tell me that before?
- Did you bother to inform me?

00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:53.441
I am telling you now.
- So am I.

00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:55.681
So, you won't buy it?
- No.

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:57.001
You won't?
- No.

00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:59.281
All right. Please excuse me..
- What does that mean?

00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:01.841
It means 'okay'.
You don't have to buy it, got it?

00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:01.841
It means 'okay'.
You don't have to buy it, got it?

00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:03.841
I thought that if I buy it,
Lady Luck won't smile upon you.

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.041
So, I was asking you
to buy it instead, understood?

00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:10.121
Otherwise, a famous broker like me

00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:12.481
wouldn't even think twice
before spending Rs. 2 on something.

00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:15.241
Until you approach me
and buy the ticket from me

00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.441
I won't speak with you,
understood? Remember that!

00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:21.201
Mr. Jahar. - Nonsense!
- Mr. Jahar..

00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:24.761
He's trying to fool me

00:08:24.841 --> 00:08:26.801
by wearing fancy suits!

00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.401
You could've bought it.
- What?

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.481
The lottery ticket.
- To hell with you and your ticket!

00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:33.721
You dare ask me to buy it!

00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:35.961
A piece of paper with a few
fancy words written on it

00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.121
that costs Rs. 2!

00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:39.081
Do you know how much clay
you can buy with Rs. 2?

00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:41.641
What a pitiful sight!
To hell with you and your clay!

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.441
Yes.. Mukto.

00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.561
Come here.
Come closer.

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:56.601
Sit.
Sit down.

00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:03.281
Are you angry? - Yes.
- Why?

00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:03.281
Are you angry? - Yes.
- Why?

00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:07.281
Because of your behaviour.
Why did you fight with Mr. Jahar

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:08.961
over a measly amount?

00:09:09.041 --> 00:09:12.881
Is that the reason?
Tomorrow, I will go to the fair

00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.081
with him and sort things out.

00:09:17.561 --> 00:09:19.841
Are you telling the truth?
- Is it that hard to believe?

00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:21.801
Okay then.
What if I swear on you?

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:30.601
One, two, three!

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:36.601
"Would you like to buy
some earthen toys?"

00:09:37.361 --> 00:09:41.321
"Earthen toys.."

00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:46.641

"There are Lord Ram and Ravan

00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:15.201
"Come and take a look
at how Lord Hanuman dances."

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:20.241
"There are Lord Ram and Ravan

00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:25.481

"The one who astonished the world.
I have his idol in here."

00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:03.841
"You will not get another chance.
Tell me the price you will quote."

00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:03.841

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:14.121
"Would you like to buy

00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:29.641

"Take his idol home

00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:19.441
"You will not get another chance.

00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:50.641
Hey, Jahar, are you angry with me?

00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:51.881
Yes. - What!
- Yes.

00:14:51.961 --> 00:14:55.441
I didn't have any money yesterday.
That's why I lied to you.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:02.401
Here you go. - How much
are you paying me? - Rs. 2.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:02.401
Here you go. - How much
are you paying me? - Rs. 2.

00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:05.361
Here is the ticket.

00:15:05.441 --> 00:15:08.601
Oh, dear, you had been carrying it
with you!

00:15:08.681 --> 00:15:11.681
Yes, why would I not?
It's very valuable.

00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:18.241
So, listen,
whoever wins the lottery

00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:20.921
will be notified in the morning,
right? - Yes. - Who will do that?

00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:23.761
A telegram will be sent to him.
- Telegram?

00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.241
Is it a unit of weight?
- Oh, damn! A unit of weight!

00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:28.321
It's not a unit of weight.

00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:31.521
You know what a post office is,
right?

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.161
Messages are sent electrically,
that too, real fast, understood?

00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:36.201
Then you should've said so.
Why did you call it a telegram?

00:15:36.281 --> 00:15:38.281
Stop uttering nonsense.
You're an illiterate fool!

00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:42.201
You don't know English.
That's what it's called, got it?

00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:46.441
Idiot! - Well, if I win,
how much will I get?

00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:48.481
How much will you win?

00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:53.681
Rs. 3.95 lakhs, understood?
- Three..

00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:57.161
Please tell me how much it will be
in terms of twenty-rupee notes.

00:15:57.241 --> 00:15:58.881
In terms of twenty-rupee notes?

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.921
You need to use higher
denominations, got it? Idiot!

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.921
You need to use higher
denominations, got it? Idiot!

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:07.001
Higher denominations..

00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:22.601
Dear.. - Yes? - What are you mixing
with the rice?

00:16:23.521 --> 00:16:25.641
Higher denominations..

00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:27.761
Oh, dear!
What is this?

00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.161
If this is your condition
after buying a lottery ticket

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.561
then you will go mad
if you win the lottery.

00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:35.921
Here we go!
You thought I had gone mad?

00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:39.361
Silly girl!
I was just bluffing.

00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:11.161
Hey, Mukto.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:14.121
As soon as I bought the ticket,
you're unable to sleep!

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.201
What will you do if I win?

00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:20.481
Come on, it's quite late.
Go to sleep.

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:23.401
Won't you sleep?
- Yes.. I will. You sleep now.

00:17:53.441 --> 00:17:54.681
Telegram!

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.161
Telegram!

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.001
Telegram..
- A telegram, right? It's mine!

00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:07.321
Well.. Keep that.
You're a very nice person.

00:18:07.401 --> 00:18:08.761
Do come over one day
for a meal, all right?

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.361
I will feed you a lot of food!
My wife..

00:18:11.441 --> 00:18:14.041
Hey, Mukto!
Mukto..

00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:17.681
Well.. Take this basket.
Take it. Come..

00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:19.841
No.. A basket..
A basket!

00:18:20.081 --> 00:18:21.481
Jahar!
- Yes?

00:18:21.561 --> 00:18:22.961
It's here!
- What?

00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:30.921
Bhanu!

00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.161
Bhanu!

00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:00.361
Well, Bhanu..

00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:00.361
Well, Bhanu..

00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:02.761
What?
- Nothing.

00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:04.841
Hey..

00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:08.721
Won't we have to..

00:19:10.361 --> 00:19:11.721
Silly man!

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.081
Hey, Jahar.
- Yes?

00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:27.681
What are you writing
so late at night?

00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:30.801
We'll be reaching Kolkata
tomorrow morning, understood?

00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:35.921
I'm making a list of the things
we have to do.

00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:39.121
Then we'll collect the money
and wrap things up.

00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:42.761
One more thing..
There, I will be J. Hurray.

00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:45.241
J. Hurray?
What do you mean?

00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:49.881
Jahar Roy.
Or as the sophisticated men call it

00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:53.241
J. Hurray. Understood?
Listen..

00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:56.721
Once we reach Sealdah..
- Sealdah? But you said Kolkata.

00:19:56.801 --> 00:20:01.521
You are a moron!
- Even if I am one

00:19:56.801 --> 00:20:01.521
You are a moron!
- Even if I am one

00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:03.921
does that mean you will say what
you want to? Stick to one name.

00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:07.161
First, you said Kolkata.
Then you said Sealdah.

00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:08.801
I'll take both the names.
- Why?

00:20:08.921 --> 00:20:12.281
Oh, my God!
Kolkata is the city

00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:14.321
and Sealdah is the station.
Got it?

00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:19.041
How amusing! The names of the city
and the station are different!

00:20:19.121 --> 00:20:20.681
Oh, dear, you're..
God!

00:20:20.801 --> 00:20:24.001
Kolkata is the official name
and Sealdah is the nickname.

00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:28.161
Once we reach Sealdah, I'll
call up at the Luck Velky office.

00:20:29.601 --> 00:20:33.641
What time? What?
Right. Thank you!

00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:40.121
Hey..

00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:42.841
Who were you talking to
with that thing?

00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:46.201
'That thing?'
That is called a telephone.

00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:49.481
Oh.. Telephone!
- Oh.. Then..

00:20:51.241 --> 00:20:53.881
Let's go. - Where?
- We have to go to the salon.

00:20:55.761 --> 00:20:57.161
Only when we go there will you
know the reason of our visit.

00:20:58.881 --> 00:21:01.481
Drat!
Rubbish!

00:20:58.881 --> 00:21:01.481
Drat!
Rubbish!

00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:03.881
Why did you throw it away?
- Why won't I?

00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:05.601
What will people say
when they see you with this?

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.201
They'll think you're a cobbler!
Come on!

00:21:07.321 --> 00:21:09.161
Come!
- So, you threw..

00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:13.601
Hey, what's this?
Are you planning to kill me?

00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:15.961
Don't get nervous.
- W-What?

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.521
Don't be scared.
- Oh..

00:21:17.641 --> 00:21:21.561
Oh, God..
What is this?

00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:24.921
No.. - Quiet!
- Oh, God..

00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:32.241
Miss, trim his hair in the front.

00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:34.721
Trim his hair a little
in the middle too.

00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.961
And.. - And trim his hair a little
at the back too.

00:21:38.721 --> 00:21:43.321
You're very smart! You got it
even before I finished talking!

00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:45.041
What about the moustache?

00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:48.321
Okay.
- Yes.

00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:54.521
I need some assistance.
- What.. Who are you calling..

00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:58.801
Hey.. I..
W-What are you doing..

00:22:56.441 --> 00:23:00.281
Mukto!
Hey, don't tickle me!

00:22:56.441 --> 00:23:00.281
Mukto!
Hey, don't tickle me!

00:23:00.361 --> 00:23:04.281
No.. This is not tickling.
This is a massage. - Massage..

00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:16.801
Hey, Jahar!

00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:21.401
Jahar! - What?
- Look at this!

00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:25.561
My cherished beard
and moustache have been shaved off!

00:23:25.641 --> 00:23:28.281
Completely shaved off!
- Yes! That's good..

00:23:28.561 --> 00:23:30.161
Isn't he satisfied?

00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:34.201
Satisfied?
Oh, he is very satisfied.

00:23:34.281 --> 00:23:35.961
Then why is he crying?

00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:41.201
Well, crying..
Well, he is very moody.

00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:44.961
Very moody.
When he's unhappy, he laughs.

00:23:45.041 --> 00:23:47.241
My goodness!
And when he is happy?

00:23:48.161 --> 00:23:52.161
When he is happy, he starts to cry.

00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:58.361
Please pay over there.
- Oh, right..

00:23:58.441 --> 00:24:01.121
Hey, Bhanu..
Hey..

00:23:58.441 --> 00:24:01.121
Hey, Bhanu..
Hey..

00:24:01.961 --> 00:24:03.241
Hey, what is this?

00:24:04.121 --> 00:24:06.801
Keep quiet!

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.201
Don't cry!

00:24:10.481 --> 00:24:12.601
How can someone cry like this
in a salon?

00:24:12.761 --> 00:24:13.801
Be quiet!

00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:20.281
God!
You really can't stop crying!

00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:23.361
After what you did to me,
do you expect me not to?

00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:25.201
Hey, this is Kolkata!
It's a big city.

00:24:25.321 --> 00:24:27.881
What will people think
if you cry over petty issues?

00:24:29.321 --> 00:24:30.361
Shame on you.

00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:38.281
What are you staring at?
- What is that man pulling?

00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:42.721
Oh! That's a rickshaw, understood?
It's a cheap mode of transportation

00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:45.161
in the city.
- Oh, dear!

00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:49.841
Is it cheaper than the carts pulled
by animals? - Yes.

00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:52.241
So strange!

00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:10.921
Found it!
Bhanu.

00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:12.721
I found it!
Come!

00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:15.801
Hush..

00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:20.681
Bhanu, we need this outfit.

00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:25.121
Do I have to wear
this outfit too? - Hush.

00:25:27.521 --> 00:25:30.881
Hey, Jahar! - What?
- It's a lady!

00:25:30.961 --> 00:25:32.641
What can I do for you?

00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:35.641
Y-You..
No..

00:25:37.081 --> 00:25:38.641
We.. We..

00:25:38.801 --> 00:25:40.921
Coat, trousers

00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:44.401
shirt and bowtie.

00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:48.801
Follow me, please.
- Thank you! Coming.

00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:50.961
Bhanu, come.

00:25:58.081 --> 00:26:01.481
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm here.

00:25:58.081 --> 00:26:01.481
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm here.

00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:23.401
Bhanu!
Bhanu..

00:26:23.761 --> 00:26:25.561
Did you see what happened?
- What?

00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:27.241
That fat woman..
- Hush!

00:26:27.281 --> 00:26:29.801
Listen.. She walked up to me,
said 'shorry'

00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:33.321
and bumped into me!
- No, it's not 'shorry'.

00:26:33.481 --> 00:26:35.881
She said 'sorry'. That means..
- To hell with it!

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:37.761
First, listen to what she did!
- Hush.. Be quiet.

00:26:37.841 --> 00:26:40.121
For shame!
She went ahead

00:26:40.201 --> 00:26:41.801
and removed this lady's clothes
without any hesitation

00:26:41.881 --> 00:26:44.201
and dressed her in this.
- What.. - Look..

00:26:44.681 --> 00:26:47.281
Silly man, it is not a lady.
It's a mannequin!

00:26:47.361 --> 00:26:48.841
What..
- Yes, come, quickly.

00:26:48.881 --> 00:26:52.761
The lady is waiting with
the outfit. Come on. - A mannequin?

00:27:33.441 --> 00:27:34.961
What the..

00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:37.481
Bhanu..
Ma'am..

00:27:37.521 --> 00:27:40.321
Ma'am.. Hey!
- Mannequin..

00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.841
Why did you hit me?
- Why did you lie to me?

00:27:42.921 --> 00:27:45.521
Why did I hit you?
It's a mannequin!

00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:49.321
She hit me because of you!
Some m-mannequin! - What the..

00:27:51.761 --> 00:27:54.681
Listen, if the bigger watch
is cheaper than the smaller one

00:27:54.721 --> 00:27:55.881
then why don't you buy
the bigger one? - Shut up!

00:27:55.961 --> 00:27:58.281
You shut up!
Don't you have a bigger one? - Hey!

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:04.321
Goodness..

00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:12.161
My neck!
What nonsense.. - Hush..

00:28:14.961 --> 00:28:17.121
Let's go.
- Where?

00:28:17.161 --> 00:28:19.121
To the Luck Velky Lottery office.
- I can't go.

00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:22.201
Hey, don't you want the money?
- No, you go.

00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:25.801
Hey! You won the lottery.
They won't give me the money.

00:28:25.841 --> 00:28:29.281
What if they talk in English
after seeing me in these clothes?

00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:30.401
Then you can divert the questions
to me

00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:33.241
and say,
'Talk to my brother, please!'.

00:28:33.321 --> 00:28:34.721
Come..
- It's so long!

00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:37.601
God! - Can't you shorten that?
- That is not possible!

00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:40.561
Not possible?
When you can have my beard and..

00:28:40.641 --> 00:28:45.401
I can't do it. I won't go.
- You won't go? - No.

00:28:45.761 --> 00:28:48.641
What will happen then?

00:28:49.001 --> 00:28:51.561
Goodness!
- What will happen.. - Wait.

00:28:51.801 --> 00:28:54.601
Wait.. Let me think.
- But..

00:28:58.241 --> 00:29:00.761
Why are your legs shaking?
- I am thinking.

00:28:58.241 --> 00:29:00.761
Why are your legs shaking?
- I am thinking.

00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:02.361
All right.

00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:06.321
Idea!
- What?

00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:09.801
Here's what you can do.
- What?

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:13.521
Listen, pretend that you're mute.

00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:18.841
Mute? Goodness..
- Yes. Come on..

00:29:19.001 --> 00:29:21.121
Let's go..

00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:26.481
Hey, Bhanu, show me the ticket.
- I left it at the station. - Stop!

00:29:26.561 --> 00:29:27.881
I'm talking about the lottery
ticket, not the train ticket.

00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:31.481
Lottery.. - Okay.. Lottery ticket..
- Lottery ticket.. Give me that.

00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:33.721
Lottery ticket..
- W-What happened?

00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:35.641
I can't find it..
- W-What did you say?

00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:37.841
I can't find it..
- What! Really?

00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:38.841
Where could I have kept it?

00:29:38.921 --> 00:29:41.201
How careless!
Go look for it, you fool!

00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:44.561
The lottery.. The ticket..
- God! Go on, look for it.

00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:10.201
The lottery ticket.. Drat!
- The lottery ticket..

00:30:18.801 --> 00:30:21.361
Bhanu, did you find it?
- What?

00:30:22.281 --> 00:30:26.841
No..
- What? Really?

00:30:33.321 --> 00:30:37.441
We spent all the money
I had taken on a loan.

00:30:38.241 --> 00:30:41.521
Now, repaying the loan
will be an uphill task!

00:30:44.201 --> 00:30:47.841
What a shame!
All that money

00:30:48.081 --> 00:30:50.041
is lost now!

00:30:52.321 --> 00:30:53.321
Bhanu.

00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:58.281
Bhanu?

00:30:59.601 --> 00:31:02.401
My heart is aching badly!

00:30:59.601 --> 00:31:02.401
My heart is aching badly!

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:06.881
'The heart..'
I found it! It's here!

00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:10.521
What.. - I got it.. Here it is..
It had been here all long.

00:31:11.761 --> 00:31:14.921
Close to the heart..

00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:18.481
'Luck Velky Suites.'

00:31:21.361 --> 00:31:26.161
Gentlemen, meet Mr. Bhanu.
I mean, Bhanu Chitrakar.

00:31:26.401 --> 00:31:29.801
He won the first prize
of Luck Velky Lottery!

00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:38.601
Three cheers for lucky Bhanu!
Hip hip hurray!

00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:42.081
Hip hip hurray..
- Goodness!

00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:44.521
What happened?
- T-They..

00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:48.841
They said they will beat me..

00:31:48.921 --> 00:31:51.681
Shut up.. You're mute..
- Okay..

00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:54.161
Hush..
You're mute..

00:31:54.241 --> 00:31:56.441
Don't be nervous.
Go stand on the dais.

00:31:57.201 --> 00:32:01.281
What's that?
- Hush. The wooden plank.

00:31:57.201 --> 00:32:01.281
What's that?
- Hush. The wooden plank.

00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:02.761
That's a wooden plank?
- Yes.

00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:05.881
If I go stand on it alone,
there will be bloodshed.

00:32:05.961 --> 00:32:08.201
You are supposed
to pretend to be mute.

00:32:08.241 --> 00:32:10.961
Please accompany me..
- Hush..

00:32:21.561 --> 00:32:23.761
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:31.921
I am very sorry.
Only gentlemen.

00:32:32.281 --> 00:32:33.641
My friend..

00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:38.401
Bhanu Chitrakar
didn't commit suicide

00:32:38.641 --> 00:32:42.201
or go mad in the joy
of winning the lottery.

00:32:42.601 --> 00:32:44.721
He has gone mute.

00:32:44.881 --> 00:32:49.561
Oh, dear!
- No.. Don't feel bad, please..

00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:51.681
Don't worry..
He will start talking again.

00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:55.401
He will..

00:32:55.521 --> 00:33:00.081
After that.. - Hey..
- Hush. You're mute.

00:32:55.521 --> 00:33:00.081
After that.. - Hey..
- Hush. You're mute.

00:33:01.121 --> 00:33:03.841
After that, we will invest
this money in our business.

00:33:04.241 --> 00:33:06.161
We will ask for your support.

00:33:06.721 --> 00:33:09.361
We hope that we get it.
- Absolutely!

00:33:09.481 --> 00:33:10.801
Gentlemen!

00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:17.241
Thank you very much!
Thank you.

00:33:17.641 --> 00:33:18.801
Thank you..

00:33:28.961 --> 00:33:32.401
Bad luck!
- Whose, Mr. Halder?

00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:35.681
Mine! Who else could it be?
I didn't win the lottery

00:33:35.761 --> 00:33:38.481
because of the difference
of just one digit.

00:33:38.561 --> 00:33:39.401
Who won it?

00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:42.881
Bhanu Chitrakar, an artist
from the village of Paladanga.

00:33:43.201 --> 00:33:45.041
Look, here is a photo of his.

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:52.521
Hurray!
- 'Hurray?'

00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:54.521
Yes, it's J. Hurray.
Mr. Jahar.

00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:57.401
Do you know him?
- I don't just know him.

00:33:57.641 --> 00:34:02.401
We are in a relationship too!
- Really? Very good..

00:33:57.641 --> 00:34:02.401
We are in a relationship too!
- Really? Very good..

00:34:02.761 --> 00:34:04.841
Take a chance.
Not much.

00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:06.521
That kind of money
will make Lady Luck smile upon us.

00:34:07.201 --> 00:34:09.801
We'll bag a motion picture.
We will get a promotion.

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.761
You will be the lead actress
and I'll be the director.

00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:13.201
My growth in the professional
field has been stagnant.

00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:15.761
After serving all the directors
for the last 14 years

00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:17.401
I have been reduced to nothing!

00:34:19.681 --> 00:34:23.161
Let's see what I can do.
- No, you will have to do it.

00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:26.561
Where have Jahar and his friend
checked in?

00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:32.401
Hotel Honolulu.
- I see..

00:34:32.521 --> 00:34:35.361
I have to book an appointment
with Mr. Bhanu right now.

00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:38.401
Right now? But he won't speak.
- He won't speak?

00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:42.801
How can he? He has gone mute
in the joy of winning the lottery.

00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:47.201
So be it. But I'll definitely talk.
- You'll talk to a mute guy?

00:34:48.241 --> 00:34:49.481
No.

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.641
Yes?

00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:06.921
Who?

00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:09.081
Mini?

00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:13.441
What a shame..

00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:18.481
Why would you need an appointment
to meet me?

00:35:18.881 --> 00:35:22.041
Mini, you weren't like this before.

00:35:22.481 --> 00:35:25.281
Mini, my naughty girl..

00:35:25.441 --> 00:35:28.401
Shut up.
No.. Not you.

00:35:28.681 --> 00:35:31.521
No..
Not you..

00:35:31.681 --> 00:35:34.481
My sweetheart!
Naughty..

00:35:35.081 --> 00:35:39.801
My naughty girl.. What?
All right.. Do hurry.

00:35:39.921 --> 00:35:42.441
I am waiting for you.

00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:47.041
Very good..

00:35:48.441 --> 00:35:51.721
Bye..

00:35:58.361 --> 00:35:59.521
What are you staring at?

00:36:00.521 --> 00:36:01.681
It's that girl, isn't it?

00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:03.561
You got me.
- Why would I not?

00:36:03.641 --> 00:36:05.921
You are blushing!
- Stop it!

00:36:06.681 --> 00:36:09.881
Go bathe, quickly.
- Right now? - Yes..

00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:19.521
Hey.. - What?
- What will I wear after bathing?

00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:22.041
God! The dressing gown
is in the bathroom. Go!

00:36:22.121 --> 00:36:25.601
I-I will have to tie
the drawstring again.

00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:28.201
God! Go bathe, quickly.
We have to go to the bank.

00:36:28.281 --> 00:36:30.401
W-What's a bank? - The place
where money is deposited.

00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:31.601
In your name.
- In your name.

00:36:31.641 --> 00:36:33.361
No, in your name.
- No.. Yours.

00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.321
Oh, God!
Not in my name.

00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:37.321
The money's yours and money makes
the world go round. Understood?

00:36:37.401 --> 00:36:40.241
I could convince her to be your
friend just because of the money.

00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:42.281
Go bathe, quickly..

00:36:45.761 --> 00:36:47.561
"La.."

00:36:50.921 --> 00:36:54.201
May I come in?
- What? Who is it?

00:36:54.641 --> 00:36:58.401
Mini? Come in, please.
Come in..

00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:03.361
Please sit.

00:37:05.201 --> 00:37:07.121
If I hadn't asked,
you wouldn't have called me.

00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:09.801
Would I not have?
- No, you wouldn't have.

00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:12.961
Previously,
when you would go on a leave

00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:15.561
we would exchange
a ton of letters.

00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:18.241
But this time..

00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:24.361
This time..
I thought

00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:27.521
of sending our wedding card

00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:30.401
instead of a letter.

00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:49.161
Oh, my God!
I'm getting scalded! God..

00:37:49.281 --> 00:37:53.321
I'm getting scalded..
Hey, Jahar, where are you?

00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:55.361
What happened?

00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:58.241
I turned on the hot water
instead of the cold one. - Great!

00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:01.161
My entire body is burning!
Oh, my God..

00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:01.161
My entire body is burning!
Oh, my God..

00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:03.481
Oh, my God! Why should I?
- Shut up! Quiet!

00:38:03.561 --> 00:38:05.441
It is burning like hell
and I can't even cry!

00:38:05.521 --> 00:38:08.761
Quiet! - What? - Did you forget
that you've gone mute?

00:38:08.841 --> 00:38:11.601
I am mute.. - Quiet!
- Oh, God!

00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:18.321
Please don't be angry, dear.
No.. Don't look away.

00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:21.561
Talk to me, please.
- I will.

00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:25.761
But on one condition.
- Only one?

00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:28.241
Only one?
Tell me what it is.

00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:30.681
Arrange for some money
for the film, please.

00:38:30.761 --> 00:38:32.441
I'd rather commit suicide
than do that.

00:38:33.081 --> 00:38:34.721
Mini, you don't even know

00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:37.481
when you will give up the pursuit
of being an actress

00:38:37.521 --> 00:38:41.201
and dream
about settling down with me.

00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:45.161
With that hope in my heart,
I still haven't got married.

00:38:45.481 --> 00:38:49.121
I see.. Do you think I am asking
for the money to become an actress?

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.641
Then what do you need
the money for?

00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:54.121
I will be a producer.
- A producer?

00:38:54.201 --> 00:38:56.801
Very good!
Then go for it!

00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:58.961
What about the money?
- Money?

00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:00.401
Show Bhanu your studio once

00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:00.401
Show Bhanu your studio once

00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:03.161
and let me understand the business.
Then you will get the money.

00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:05.121
Really?

00:39:06.721 --> 00:39:08.081
Yes.

00:39:17.041 --> 00:39:19.761
I finished bathing quickly
after being scalded by hot water.

00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:21.081
So, I am back.

00:39:21.961 --> 00:39:23.601
It's that girl, right?
- What?

00:39:24.001 --> 00:39:26.161
That girl.
- Who are you?

00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:28.121
This is Bhanu.

00:39:29.161 --> 00:39:32.201
But he can talk.
- Why wouldn't I be able to?

00:39:32.361 --> 00:39:34.401
I am not mute, you know.

00:39:34.761 --> 00:39:37.321
But the papers published that..
- The papers?

00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:40.801
You mean, the newspapers, right?
They publish rubbish.

00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:43.801
Sit, Bhanu..
Sit..

00:39:45.721 --> 00:39:46.681
Mr. Bhanu.

00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:49.801
Our studio..
- What's that?

00:39:49.881 --> 00:39:52.641
Studio, the place
where films are made.

00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:56.601
Film.. - Yes..
She was saying that..

00:39:56.681 --> 00:40:01.161
I invite you two to our studio
tomorrow evening. - Okay..

00:39:56.681 --> 00:40:01.161
I invite you two to our studio
tomorrow evening. - Okay..

00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:02.561
You will come, won't you?

00:40:02.881 --> 00:40:05.681
Of course!
- Yes, of course.. I will!

00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:09.961
Yes..
- We will!

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.641
This is Radha Film Studio.
Jahar..

00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:13.721
Let's go in.

00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:15.561
MGS Pictures is shooting a film

00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:18.641
on this floor.
- Great.. - Great..

00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:24.601
You rush in.. - Okay.
- But do not stop.

00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:27.561
Then you see.. What do you see..
- What do I see? What?

00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:30.041
You see that..
- That it's shaking.. A lot..

00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:32.361
Y-Yes..
- Shaking.

00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:35.241
Kanai, has the light been fixed?
- Turn on light number 30!

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:38.801
A little to the left..

00:40:39.441 --> 00:40:42.601
The people here have poor
eyesight. - Why do you say that?

00:40:42.681 --> 00:40:45.721
Otherwise, why would
the lights be so bright? - I see.

00:40:45.841 --> 00:40:47.841
In order to see everything clearly

00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:51.801
a lot of light is needed.
And apart from that.. - Quiet!

00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:55.121
Quiet on the sets!
- Move the lights a little..

00:40:55.201 --> 00:40:57.881
Monitor!
- Yes, ready.

00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:00.681
Mini.
- Yes?

00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:00.681
Mini.
- Yes?

00:41:01.561 --> 00:41:03.561
I don't quite understand this.

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:07.161
Let a few days go by. After that,
you will understand everything.

00:41:08.201 --> 00:41:11.441
It's better if you write
the story. - Me? - Yes, you.

00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:14.201
Writing a story for a film
is not a Herculean task.

00:41:14.281 --> 00:41:16.081
No, I won't be able to write that.

00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:20.561
Then let Mr. Bhanu write..
- Who? Bhanu?

00:41:21.841 --> 00:41:23.641
Will he be able to do something
I can't?

00:41:23.721 --> 00:41:27.401
Hey, listen, have one
of the writers of books hired.

00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:31.441
How can writers of books
write the script of a film?

00:41:31.801 --> 00:41:34.241
Instead,
I'll have Mr. Halder write it.

00:41:34.321 --> 00:41:35.841
Where has Bhanu gone?

00:41:36.641 --> 00:41:41.081
Don't worry about him.
Mr. Halder is with him.

00:41:41.801 --> 00:41:46.001
Now, we are taking!
Kanai? - Taking..

00:41:46.841 --> 00:41:47.961
Lights!

00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:53.801
Hold on..
- Be quick.. Do it quickly..

00:41:53.881 --> 00:41:57.841
Basu, take two.
- Come on..

00:41:58.801 --> 00:42:01.681
Now, it's ready.
- All right. Start sound!

00:41:58.801 --> 00:42:01.681
Now, it's ready.
- All right. Start sound!

00:42:02.521 --> 00:42:05.961
Running.
- Ready.. - Take two.

00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:10.481
Bhanu, action!
Bhanu, go!

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:13.401
Hey, Bhanu!
Run to the scene..

00:42:15.721 --> 00:42:19.601
You! - I was going to ask
the same question.

00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:21.601
I am Bhanu Bandopadhyay.

00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:23.841
You've come to watch a shoot
in Tollygunge

00:42:23.921 --> 00:42:25.401
and you don't know who I am?

00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:27.201
But who are you?

00:42:27.241 --> 00:42:28.161
Sir.

00:42:28.241 --> 00:42:31.081
Did you get a duplicate
for I couldn't give you any dates?

00:42:31.241 --> 00:42:34.441
Hey.. Sir, sorry!
Let's go!

00:42:35.881 --> 00:42:39.001
What could Bhanu be doing?
This is the problem with him..

00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:41.441
He is friendly to everyone
no matter where he goes.

00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:48.681
Sir? - Sir?
- Sir, over here! Sir!

00:42:49.001 --> 00:42:50.521
Over here!

00:42:51.441 --> 00:42:52.361
Coming.

00:42:53.161 --> 00:42:54.601
Congratulations, Mini!

00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:57.361
I heard the good news this morning
at Halder's house.

00:42:57.761 --> 00:43:01.441
Which news? - You're a star now,
a film star in the making.

00:42:57.761 --> 00:43:01.441
Which news? - You're a star now,
a film star in the making.

00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:04.081
The lottery winner
is your financier now.

00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:06.681
A big shot film star
is working in this film and..

00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:09.561
Let me introduce him to you.
Mr. J. Hurray.. Mr. Jahar.

00:43:09.761 --> 00:43:12.481
And this is Mr. Lane,
a big shot in the film industry.

00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:15.441
He's very dear to me.
- Hello. - Hello!

00:43:15.641 --> 00:43:17.481
Can I take a photo of yours,
Ms. Mini?

00:43:18.241 --> 00:43:20.321
Sure, why not!
- Can you please get up?

00:43:21.521 --> 00:43:22.521
Get up.

00:43:23.841 --> 00:43:25.521
Thank you.
Please move.

00:43:28.121 --> 00:43:29.921
No, not closer to her.
Move away.

00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:36.201
Ms. Mini, please lie down.

00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:50.401
Not like that.
Like this.

00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:55.041
Now, move your legs..

00:43:57.161 --> 00:44:00.521
Right.
Now.. Okay!

00:43:57.161 --> 00:44:00.521
Right.
Now.. Okay!

00:44:03.081 --> 00:44:04.281
Drat!

00:44:04.361 --> 00:44:09.161
There is a dog in the background!
Sir, please go there.

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.921
Ready!

00:44:20.881 --> 00:44:21.761
Thank you!

00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:26.921
I'll publish this photo
on the cover page

00:44:27.001 --> 00:44:27.921
of the next issue
of 'Filmy Duniya', the magazine.

00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.161
I'd like to take your leave now.

00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:32.801
One day, I will come over
for some tea. - Okay.

00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:41.121
Great..
No one cares about me..

00:44:43.361 --> 00:44:45.001
Are you angry?
- Yes!

00:44:46.481 --> 00:44:48.801
Why?
- Because I am not happy!

00:44:49.601 --> 00:44:52.081
Why not?
- 'Why not?'

00:44:52.601 --> 00:44:55.401
The way you were posing
with that man!

00:44:55.481 --> 00:44:59.281
That man?
He is a big shot of the film..

00:44:59.361 --> 00:45:01.281
Forget about him!
You tell me!

00:44:59.361 --> 00:45:01.281
Forget about him!
You tell me!

00:45:01.361 --> 00:45:04.281
For shame..
Really, Mini?

00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:06.601
You say something
but you don't mean it.

00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:08.601
Yesterday, you told me
that you wanted to be a producer.

00:45:08.681 --> 00:45:10.521
Now, you want to become an actress?

00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:14.521
You don't want me
to realise my dreams.

00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:17.361
Is this how much you love me?
- To hell with it!

00:45:17.441 --> 00:45:21.001
I won't talk to you.
- What!

00:45:21.441 --> 00:45:22.441
You won't talk to me?

00:45:24.081 --> 00:45:26.961
She won't talk..
So be it!

00:45:29.441 --> 00:45:32.961
To hell with everything..

00:45:33.081 --> 00:45:34.881
Drive!

00:45:37.881 --> 00:45:39.321
Why are you here by yourself?

00:45:40.721 --> 00:45:41.961
Mr. Halder.
- Yes?

00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:44.801
Call Kanjia so that Mr. Bhanu
can be driven back to the hotel.

00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:47.801
Taxi?
- Where is Jahar? - He left.

00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:49.801
No..
How can he leave without me?

00:45:49.961 --> 00:45:51.161
Come..
- Well.. What?

00:46:10.241 --> 00:46:12.201
What do you want?
- Should I serve the food?

00:46:13.121 --> 00:46:16.441
Let Mr. Bhanu come back.
- You two went out together.

00:46:17.361 --> 00:46:19.521
Yes, we did

00:46:19.881 --> 00:46:22.561
but then I got angry with someone
and came back.

00:46:24.041 --> 00:46:27.961
But that poor soul
was left behind.

00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.961
Bhanu, you're back.

00:46:32.401 --> 00:46:36.521
How did you come back alone?
- Well, not alone.

00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:39.481
Mini dropped me off at the hotel.
- Mini? - Yes!

00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:40.961
That lady!

00:46:42.401 --> 00:46:43.881
Mini?
- Yes.

00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:47.921
You stormed off in a fit of rage.
She dropped me here. - Bhanu!

00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:52.241
Don't utter her name in front of
me! I don't want to see her again!

00:46:52.881 --> 00:46:55.801
What are you staring at?
Go serve the meal!

00:46:59.321 --> 00:47:00.401
Mini!

00:46:59.321 --> 00:47:00.401
Mini!

00:47:04.841 --> 00:47:07.841
What did you ask him to bring?
- Food! - I see.

00:47:12.161 --> 00:47:15.521
I'm done eating.
You didn't eat last night either.

00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:18.841
Come on, eat.

00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:21.081
Hey, you may leave now.

00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:26.681
What is wrong with you?
- I am not in a good mood.

00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:30.801
Oh, is that the reason?
Then you should eat more.

00:47:31.881 --> 00:47:35.561
Starving oneself in a bad mood
upsets the stomach. - Let it be.

00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:38.361
You won't eat, will you?
Let it not go to waste then.

00:47:40.041 --> 00:47:43.921
Oh, the food is delicious!

00:47:47.001 --> 00:47:49.081
Answer the phone.
- What?

00:47:49.161 --> 00:47:50.561
Pick up the phone!

00:47:55.081 --> 00:47:56.721
Pick it up, quickly!

00:48:00.681 --> 00:48:01.801
It's upside down.

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:04.801
Hello?

00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:07.641
Hello?

00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:10.401
Hello?

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:14.041
If I try to go any closer to hell,
I will fall.

00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:17.001
Mr. Bhanu?
- Yes, this is Bhanu.

00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:20.641
Can I stand straight now?
- Yes. - Okay.

00:48:20.841 --> 00:48:23.001
Bathroom..
- What are you saying?

00:48:24.441 --> 00:48:27.881
No, not you. Not you.
Who are you?

00:48:27.961 --> 00:48:31.641
This is Mini. - Oh!
- Put Jahar on the line, please.

00:48:31.681 --> 00:48:35.321
Jahar! It's her!
- What! Mini?

00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:40.161
Oh, shut your mouth!
- Okay, I will.

00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:43.361
What!
- I have shut my mouth.

00:48:44.001 --> 00:48:46.001
Well..
- What are you saying?

00:48:46.681 --> 00:48:48.561
Why are you making her wait?
Talk.

00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:51.001
I don't talk to people
who get angry all the time.

00:48:51.201 --> 00:48:53.881
'I don't talk to people who get
angry all the time..' - Hey!

00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:57.081
Moron!
- Mr. Bhanu..

00:48:57.921 --> 00:49:00.881
Are you listening?
He is very angry, isn't he?

00:48:57.921 --> 00:49:00.881
Are you listening?
He is very angry, isn't he?

00:49:00.961 --> 00:49:03.561
Yes, a lot.
- I am coming over.

00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:06.481
Ask him to stay there, okay?
Bye.

00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:08.001
Bye.

00:49:14.641 --> 00:49:16.361
Mini is coming over.
- When?

00:49:16.441 --> 00:49:20.641
Right now. - Tell her
that I left regarding some work.

00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:24.801
It's very important
and I will be busy for a few days.

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:28.081
I'll be out regarding some work.
Understood?

00:49:34.401 --> 00:49:36.081
'Tell her
that I left regarding some work.'

00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:39.281
'I will be busy for a few days.'

00:49:40.321 --> 00:49:43.761
'Very important work.
Important work..'

00:49:48.321 --> 00:49:49.401
Jahar?

00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:52.481
Are you leaving?
- Yes!

00:49:54.681 --> 00:49:58.241
Didn't you know
that I was coming over? - I did!

00:50:00.481 --> 00:50:02.361
Don't you have anything
to tell me?

00:50:02.481 --> 00:50:03.801
In fact, I do.

00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:07.041
Tell me then.

00:50:07.281 --> 00:50:10.681
Go upstairs and hear about it!
- Upstairs? - Yes.

00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:12.041
Bhanu will tell you about it.

00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:21.281
Jahar has gone out..
Regarding some important work.

00:50:22.401 --> 00:50:24.681
V-Very important work..

00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:27.441
Jahar has gone out..
Regarding some important work.

00:50:27.521 --> 00:50:28.561
He will be busy for a few days.

00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:30.761
Jahar has gone out..
Regarding some important work.

00:50:30.841 --> 00:50:31.681
He will be busy for a few days.

00:50:31.721 --> 00:50:34.041
Jahar has gone out..
Regarding some important work.

00:50:34.121 --> 00:50:36.641
He will be busy for a few days.
Work.. - Work?

00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:40.481
I got that.
After that? - After that..

00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.961
He didn't say anything after that.

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.321
You are a simpleton.

00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:48.641
Is it possible to make you memorise
and say anything he wishes?

00:50:48.721 --> 00:50:51.841
You see..
Why would I lie intentionally?

00:50:52.361 --> 00:50:53.641
Very true.

00:50:53.921 --> 00:50:57.041
Won't you ask me to sit?
- P-Please!

00:50:58.161 --> 00:51:00.361
Why did you get up?
- Because you sat down.

00:50:58.161 --> 00:51:00.361
Why did you get up?
- Because you sat down.

00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:04.441
So what? - Nothing..
I mean.. - That means

00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:08.721
you are very shy.
- W-What do you mean?

00:51:10.001 --> 00:51:13.681
Bashful.
- No..

00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:16.721
Actually..
Two people alone in a room..

00:51:16.801 --> 00:51:20.001
Well..
- I got it.

00:51:20.401 --> 00:51:21.561
Sit down.

00:51:26.681 --> 00:51:28.801
When Jahar didn't receive my call

00:51:29.201 --> 00:51:31.161
I knew he wouldn't wait for me.

00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:36.321
I met him on the way.
He didn't even talk to me properly.

00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:41.041
Can you guess
why I came here anyway?

00:51:41.121 --> 00:51:42.761
I-I don't know..

00:51:43.681 --> 00:51:45.241
To see someone.
- Who?

00:51:45.641 --> 00:51:47.241
You.
- Why?

00:51:47.881 --> 00:51:50.201
Because I love to see you..
- W-What..

00:51:53.921 --> 00:51:56.961
Get up.
- Get up? - Yes!

00:52:00.641 --> 00:52:02.441
Then why did you ask me to sit?

00:52:02.641 --> 00:52:03.681
So that I could ask you
to get up.

00:52:04.081 --> 00:52:07.641
I see. Do I have to do
the squats? - No.

00:52:08.521 --> 00:52:11.001
We'll go out.
- Go out?

00:52:11.081 --> 00:52:14.481
Jahar is not here. How can I
go alone.. - You're not alone.

00:52:14.561 --> 00:52:16.841
We will go out together.

00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:23.201
W-Why did you stop?
- Won't you change? - I see..

00:52:27.921 --> 00:52:32.001
Are we going to get some fresh air?
- No. - Then?

00:52:32.321 --> 00:52:34.921
We're going on an outing.
- Oh, I see, an outing..

00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:37.681
It would have been great
had Jahar been here.

00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:41.241
Let's go back.
- Why?

00:52:41.881 --> 00:52:43.841
Seems like
you don't like my company.

00:52:43.961 --> 00:52:46.081
No..
I like it.

00:52:46.841 --> 00:52:50.001
That's a lie.
- No.. It's true. I swear on you.

00:52:52.121 --> 00:52:55.081
You and I are all alone

00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:59.281
in the car.
And you touched me..

00:52:59.841 --> 00:53:04.321
I'm feeling very shy.
- Feeling shy..

00:52:59.841 --> 00:53:04.321
I'm feeling very shy.
- Feeling shy..

00:53:04.441 --> 00:53:07.681
Who are they? I bet they're here
to marvel at the river.

00:53:07.921 --> 00:53:10.761
No, they are homeless.

00:53:11.281 --> 00:53:14.521
They haven't yet managed to find
a place to stay. - I see.

00:53:29.361 --> 00:53:32.161
What are you looking at?
- How ironical!

00:53:32.561 --> 00:53:35.641
People are starving
but we feed the animals.

00:53:37.161 --> 00:53:38.921
The tiger growled!

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.161
Why are you plugging your nose?
- It stinks!

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:50.241
The tiger? - No!
The people who went by..

00:53:50.321 --> 00:53:51.601
Oh, God!

00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:52.001
How is the zoo?
- Very nice!

00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:57.361
Don't they rent rooms here?

00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:01.681
Why? - Well,
we could have stayed here.

00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:01.681
Why? - Well,
we could have stayed here.

00:55:09.401 --> 00:55:13.121
Come to my house tomorrow
sharp at 6 p.m.

00:55:13.201 --> 00:55:15.721
I see.. - I will take you
to another zoo. - I see.

00:55:15.801 --> 00:55:18.401
B-But I don't know the route.

00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:22.921
Here is my address.

00:55:23.001 --> 00:55:25.201
If you show this
to the taxi driver.. - But..

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:28.121
But why take the trouble?
When Jahar comes..

00:55:28.881 --> 00:55:32.721
Don't do that, not even by mistake!
- Why?

00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:38.041
He is furious with me.
- That is true.

00:55:38.161 --> 00:55:42.161
If he learns that we're going out..
- He will be very angry, I know.

00:55:42.401 --> 00:55:46.441
Tomorrow.. A-At 6 p.m.?
- Yes, right.

00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:24.481
I was playing hide and seek
the way.. - Where are you going?

00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:27.401
I am going out.
- Why were you sneaking out?

00:56:27.481 --> 00:56:31.641
Did you let me go out
when I wanted to?

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:35.641
Don't go out alone in the evening.
You'll be lost and invite trouble.

00:56:35.721 --> 00:56:36.921
Come on now!

00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:39.761
Sit.

00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:50.801
Don't you feel suffocated
staying indoors all day?

00:56:51.321 --> 00:56:55.041
If you won't let me go alone,
come with.. No..

00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:59.361
No.. How can I go?
You are right.

00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:01.641
Mini is cross with me.

00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:01.641
Mini is cross with me.

00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:05.961
What if she comes for me
and then goes back? No..

00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:09.081
I won't be able to leave the room.
- Can I take him?

00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:18.761
Kharibuddin, take him out.
- Please come.

00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:22.001
Don't go too far.

00:57:35.721 --> 00:57:36.801
What happened?

00:57:37.641 --> 00:57:39.361
Can I say something?
- Please.

00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:44.761
Wherever we are going..
We're going there together.

00:57:45.001 --> 00:57:46.721
When we are going together

00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:49.201
you will see what I do.

00:57:49.281 --> 00:57:51.201
Right.
- Really?

00:57:51.921 --> 00:57:56.441
Well, if you see what I do

00:57:56.521 --> 00:57:59.321
you will tell Jahar about it,
right? - Certainly.

00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:00.721
Seriously?

00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:00.721
Seriously?

00:58:01.321 --> 00:58:04.761
Okay, what if I go alone
and not take you along?

00:58:04.841 --> 00:58:08.201
I won't see or say anything.
- You won't say anything?

00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:11.841
In that case, you..
You won't go!

00:58:12.481 --> 00:58:13.401
What?

00:58:14.681 --> 00:58:17.361
Why?
- To keep my mouth shut.

00:58:17.441 --> 00:58:20.161
I see..
A bribe..

00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:01.761
Cutlets and custard pudding.

00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:01.761
Cutlets and custard pudding.

00:59:57.921 --> 00:59:59.801
Wow, that looks beautiful!

01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:01.841
It would have been
even more beautiful on clay.

01:00:08.441 --> 01:00:11.201
Hey! That's not meant
to be consumed!

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.801
You cleanse your hands with that.

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:22.601
Now, get up.
- Why?

01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:25.681
We will dance.
- You will make me dance too?

01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:28.121
Come on.

01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:03.521
How do you feel?
- I feel like I will fall.

01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:05.321
Initially, it will be
a little uncomfortable

01:01:05.401 --> 01:01:07.481
but after some time..
- I will die!

01:01:24.121 --> 01:01:25.041
Damn it!

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:36.801
I can't dance anymore!

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.641
I cannot take it anymore..

01:01:48.481 --> 01:01:49.801
I cannot take it anymore.

01:01:53.641 --> 01:01:54.961
I can't do this anymore!

01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:17.241
I feel at ease now.
Grandma used to say

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:19.561
that if one steps on a
banana peel and falls down

01:02:19.721 --> 01:02:21.561
a rope is tied around
his affected leg

01:02:21.601 --> 01:02:24.481
and he is subjected
to this treatment..

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:35.961
Oh! Ouch!
Oh, God!

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:40.401
Oh, dear..

01:02:40.481 --> 01:02:43.041
My leg is no more lifted..

01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:54.241
What a beautiful place!
- Do you feel good to be here?

01:02:54.681 --> 01:02:58.361
Yes! Wow!
So many flowers!

01:03:02.961 --> 01:03:05.961
There are many more.
- Let's go, check them out.

01:03:06.761 --> 01:03:07.641
Let's go.

01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:21.401
Mini, I couldn't
find you at your house.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:26.201
There's no one in office
at lunch time..

01:03:27.881 --> 01:03:31.881
You are not feeling good, right?
That's fine..

01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:36.281
Hey!
You are crying!

01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:41.481
Oh, please! No.. My sweetheart!

01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:44.961
Please don't shout..

01:03:45.041 --> 01:03:46.961
I am not a thief,
a crook or a rogue..

01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:49.241
How could you just touch a
woman who you don't know..

01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:53.121
No, it's not that.
There was a lady who used to

01:03:53.241 --> 01:03:56.241
be at this desk and do
the same work as you..

01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:59.481
So, I mistook you for her..
We are.. - I see..

01:03:59.681 --> 01:04:02.521
Are you talking about Mini?
- Yes, exactly!

01:03:59.681 --> 01:04:02.521
Are you talking about Mini?
- Yes, exactly!

01:04:02.601 --> 01:04:06.601
How do you know? - We used
to go for typing classes together.

01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:08.961
I see!
- But I didn't recognise you.

01:04:09.081 --> 01:04:11.841
Let me introduce him.
- Uncle!

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:16.681
He is my nephew,
Mr. Jahar.

01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:19.921
He worked here for long..
He was my right-hand.

01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:22.401
She is Ms. Maya Thang.

01:04:22.721 --> 01:04:24.281
She is working here
in Mini's place.

01:04:24.441 --> 01:04:26.521
Ms. Thang, can you please
go out for some time?

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:29.961
Come, Jahar. Sit.

01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:34.041
Do you have a cigarette?

01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:38.401
You are elder to me..

01:04:38.481 --> 01:04:40.361
Don't care about all that
when it comes to smoking.

01:04:50.281 --> 01:04:53.601
Not bad. Here.

01:04:56.561 --> 01:04:58.521
How can I smoke in front of you..

01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:04.201
No.. - When the son touches 16,
he becomes a friend.

01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:06.881
I mean, as they say

01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:10.401
once the son touches 16,
he becomes his dad's friend.

01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:11.641
Here.

01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:19.881
You are still too young to
carry one full can of them!

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.601
If you keep a full can with you

01:05:21.721 --> 01:05:24.761
you'll smoke frequently
and that'll harm your lungs.

01:05:28.281 --> 01:05:31.961
Now, to business.
Listen, my dear.

01:05:32.841 --> 01:05:37.201
As you know, I need funds
to get things going.

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:39.561
I have done businesses
worth lakhs of rupees

01:05:39.681 --> 01:05:42.241
from this small room.

01:05:43.321 --> 01:05:45.801
There had been
profits and losses..

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:49.881
But recently, a month ago,
owing to a speculation

01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:53.641
a large amount got blocked
and we're about to shut down.

01:05:54.641 --> 01:05:56.521
Now, I want your help.

01:05:56.881 --> 01:06:00.361
I see.. How much do
you think I can help?

01:05:56.881 --> 01:06:00.361
I see.. How much do
you think I can help?

01:06:00.441 --> 01:06:04.041
You can do a lot.
Ask your friend, Bhanu

01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:07.801
to invest some money.
- Bhanu!

01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:13.721
He is too old-fashioned to
understand your business.

01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:16.481
Oh, make him interested!
Make him understand.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:19.441
I will do that,
if you cannot.

01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:22.681
When do I come over?
In the evening..

01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:26.401
You will not find him
there in the evening.

01:06:26.521 --> 01:06:30.961
He will come back
only at 10-11 p.m.

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:32.561
Where does he stay
in the evening?

01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:35.121
No.. He just roams around.

01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:55.121
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:06.561
"Let's play the game of love."

01:07:06.681 --> 01:07:12.921
"No matter how the weather is,
keep your spirits up."

01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:20.441
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:07:26.601 --> 01:07:32.281
"There is no pain or despair
in this game.."

01:07:32.521 --> 01:07:38.321
"The scorching heat is
the soothing moonlight."

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:42.441
"And let us get lost"

01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:49.321
"in a world where there
are just the two of us."

01:07:49.921 --> 01:07:56.241
"No matter how the weather is,
keep your spirits up."

01:07:56.321 --> 01:08:04.041
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:07:56.321 --> 01:08:04.041
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:17.241
"Even if a crow's cawing
gets you mad"

01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:22.801
"think that it's
a cuckoo singing."

01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:31.121
"Even if a crow's cawing
gets you mad"

01:08:31.561 --> 01:08:36.881
"think that it's
a cuckoo singing."

01:08:37.441 --> 01:08:43.201
"And the two of us,
enjoying the day, hand in hand"

01:08:43.361 --> 01:08:48.161
"looking into
each other's eyes."

01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:55.081
"No matter how the weather is,
keep your spirits up."

01:08:55.161 --> 01:09:02.361
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:08:55.161 --> 01:09:02.361
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:09:12.361 --> 01:09:17.521
"You think of me as Juliet
and yourself as Romeo."

01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:20.401
Who's Romeo?
- The legendary foreign lover.

01:09:20.521 --> 01:09:23.081
I see. A foreign
legendary lover!

01:09:23.761 --> 01:09:29.201
"You think of me as Juliet
and yourself as Romeo."

01:09:29.521 --> 01:09:35.121
"Never let sadness
get you depressed."

01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:39.481
"It feels great to experience
the feelings"

01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:44.281
"and emotions of love."

01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:51.121
"No matter how the weather is,
keep your spirits up."

01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:58.721
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:02.321
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:02.321
"Let's play the game of love.."

01:10:04.961 --> 01:10:06.601
How does it feel

01:10:07.201 --> 01:10:10.521
to be with me?
- It feels nice. And you?

01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:11.841
Me?

01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:16.641
I feel like I am a heroine.
- Hey! What's that?

01:10:16.801 --> 01:10:18.161
It means that..

01:10:19.241 --> 01:10:22.281
In movies..
- I see.. I got it.

01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:25.961
Like we see in movies..

01:10:26.441 --> 01:10:28.081
Mr. Bhanu.
- Yes..

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:32.681
I dream of it..
- What?

01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:36.201
That I am a heroine.
- Yes, why not?

01:10:37.961 --> 01:10:39.801
Would you be happy?
- Yes!

01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:45.361
But I will need money.
- I will give you.

01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:49.401
You! Why will you?

01:10:49.481 --> 01:10:51.801
Because you need it
and I have it.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.121
How much will you give me?

01:10:53.281 --> 01:10:56.361
Everything!
I mean, everything I have.

01:10:56.601 --> 01:10:58.121
Everything!
- Yes!

01:10:58.241 --> 01:11:00.881
If you give me all,
you won't have anything left.

01:10:58.241 --> 01:11:00.881
If you give me all,
you won't have anything left.

01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:04.761
That is fine.
- What if I leave you?

01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:07.041
I see. That's fine..

01:11:07.121 --> 01:11:09.881
I will make dolls
and sing songs..

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:13.121
Songs! - Yes. I will sing
songs and sell dolls.

01:11:14.241 --> 01:11:16.561
I will watch you in movies.

01:11:16.761 --> 01:11:19.761
You will be a superstar.
I will listen to your songs.

01:11:20.121 --> 01:11:21.961
But you won't be able to see me.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.321
What happened?

01:11:29.721 --> 01:11:31.561
Nothing. Let's go.

01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:39.121
You will close your eyes, right?
Okay then..

01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:43.401
Even I feel like
closing my eyes now.

01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:45.881
Yes.. This is like..

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.681
I am.. Who is it?

01:11:50.961 --> 01:11:54.481
I see.. Bhanu!
Bhanu..

01:11:55.321 --> 01:11:59.521
Where do you stay till
so late in the night?

01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:02.721
I-I just roam around.

01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:02.721
I-I just roam around.

01:12:02.801 --> 01:12:05.161
What? Just like that!

01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:08.801
How do you roam around
all alone?

01:12:08.881 --> 01:12:11.681
Not alone.
- With whom? - Not alone.

01:12:11.921 --> 01:12:13.361
Who do you roam around with?

01:12:13.441 --> 01:12:16.641
No one in particular..
All the people who walk..

01:12:16.721 --> 01:12:20.161
I see. The people who walk..

01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:26.761
With them..

01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:28.561
What are you drinking?
- What?

01:12:29.561 --> 01:12:31.281
What Devdas used to drink.

01:12:31.361 --> 01:12:33.441
Devdas! - Yes.
- What would he drink?

01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:37.441
Devdas used to love a girl.

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:41.121
And he started drinking
after failing in love.

01:12:41.881 --> 01:12:44.881
Even I loved a girl

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:48.761
and even I failed.
So..

01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:51.881
Oh, God! You are an alcoholic!
How shameful!

01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:56.201
Sh! Don't say that!

01:12:57.161 --> 01:13:01.561
Say yes to drinks!

01:12:57.161 --> 01:13:01.561
Say yes to drinks!

01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:05.841
Say yes to drinks!

01:13:07.241 --> 01:13:10.721
Do you get it?

01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:13.401
Hey, Jahar! What are you doing?

01:13:13.481 --> 01:13:16.921
I'm coming in.
You..

01:13:17.281 --> 01:13:18.961
You came back just now!
- What?

01:13:19.281 --> 01:13:22.041
Do you think you can
have your own way here?

01:13:22.161 --> 01:13:25.801
You cannot do this here.
- I won't. Who are you?

01:13:25.881 --> 01:13:28.281
I see. You cannot recognise me!

01:13:28.521 --> 01:13:30.641
I am Dayalkrishna Dam!
Jahar is my nephew.

01:13:30.721 --> 01:13:34.121
I see. You are his uncle.
Then, you are my uncle too.

01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:38.161
I am happy to see that
you are well-cultured.

01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:42.401
What is this? Why is
Jahar lying like that?

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:46.841
Who gets all this here?

01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.121
I don't. He's got it here.
He has started drinking now.

01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:50.521
That's fine.

01:13:50.921 --> 01:13:54.161
So people are rich but your
choices are cheap.

01:13:54.641 --> 01:13:58.641
What a shame!
- No, it's rum. - Quiet!

01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:00.801
This is cheap stuff!

01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:00.801
This is cheap stuff!

01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:15.921
You are elder to us.
How can you drink all this..

01:14:15.961 --> 01:14:20.081
My wish.
Do as I say, not as I do.

01:14:20.161 --> 01:14:21.201
Get up!

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:33.921
Whose cigarette is this?
- Not mine. They are his.

01:14:34.401 --> 01:14:36.841
Obstinate brat!
You've bought a can again!

01:14:40.761 --> 01:14:43.641
I don't smoke. - Sit.

01:14:51.801 --> 01:14:53.361
Bhanu.
- Yes?

01:14:53.761 --> 01:14:57.961
You cannot sit at home and spoil
yourself with all that money.

01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:03.481
If you say so, that..
- So be it! - Good..

01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:03.481
If you say so, that..
- So be it! - Good..

01:15:03.521 --> 01:15:06.121
What does that mean?
- Good. - Good.

01:15:06.681 --> 01:15:10.121
From tomorrow onwards, you guys
will work for my share market.

01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:12.961
Give me just Rs. 20,000

01:15:13.081 --> 01:15:16.561
I will use it wisely and you'll
earn huge profits.

01:15:16.801 --> 01:15:18.521
What say?
- Yes.. - Right?

01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:26.961
Stop..

01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:28.921
Hopeless, Mini..

01:15:29.001 --> 01:15:32.601
Dayalkrishna Dam convinced Bhanu
to invest money and was

01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:35.361
successful in doing so
in one day and you!

01:15:35.681 --> 01:15:37.521
You get tense way too easily..

01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:40.081
How can I help it?

01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:43.881
What if Bhanu gets
addicted to this?

01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:46.401
Don't worry. I will handle it.
- I know that.

01:15:46.561 --> 01:15:49.521
What? Right.

01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:55.481
Yes. What's the
price of iron now?

01:15:56.961 --> 01:16:01.361
I see! Sell it off..

01:15:56.961 --> 01:16:01.361
I see! Sell it off..

01:16:03.841 --> 01:16:05.081
Hello!

01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:09.481
The market closes in
five minutes. Be quick..

01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:11.761
Goodbye.

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:18.321
There's magic in business if
you know the trick, dear..

01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:22.321
I had invested the money you
two gave me in the share market.

01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:26.881
It has become thrice the amount
in just 20 days' time!

01:16:27.801 --> 01:16:31.201
Hey! You seem to be
lost in thoughts.

01:16:31.281 --> 01:16:35.281
What? Mini.
- Mini!

01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:39.481
No.. Nothing!
- Oh, I see!

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:41.921
Ms. Thang.
- Yes?

01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:44.761
We are going out.
Please close the office.

01:16:45.081 --> 01:16:46.841
Yes.. - Let's go, dear.
- Yes..

01:17:03.361 --> 01:17:04.761
Shall I pour you some more?

01:17:04.841 --> 01:17:06.561
What?
- Shall I pour you some more..

01:17:07.241 --> 01:17:09.801
Really? - Yes. - Go ahead.

01:17:15.041 --> 01:17:18.081
Half a glass.
- Half a glass! - Yes.

01:17:21.361 --> 01:17:24.081
Don't add soda..
- No soda!

01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:29.881
Uncle..

01:17:30.721 --> 01:17:34.481
You have been quiet since long..

01:17:35.201 --> 01:17:39.721
I have been talking all
this while. Say something.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.721
I am not able to meet
Bhanu for quite some days.

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:48.241
But he hasn't been able
to go too far yet.

01:17:49.961 --> 01:17:53.081
I was assessing your
love relationship.

01:17:53.761 --> 01:17:57.401
And I was taken aback.

01:17:57.521 --> 01:18:02.281
What will happen to me, Uncle?
- That's what worries me.

01:17:57.521 --> 01:18:02.281
What will happen to me, Uncle?
- That's what worries me.

01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:06.521
Really? - Yes, no wonder.

01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:10.321
Mini doesn't come here.

01:18:10.481 --> 01:18:13.721
And Bhanu roams around all alone.
- Yes..

01:18:14.081 --> 01:18:17.721
And he comes back late every day.
- Yes.

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:21.801
Do you know with whom he
roams around and where?

01:18:21.961 --> 01:18:26.321
No.
- You don't.. All right!

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:30.961
I will take you to a place
tomorrow evening.

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:34.321
Where to?
- To a party.

01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:37.321
To a party!
- Yes. - Party..

01:19:11.641 --> 01:19:14.921
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:19:15.521 --> 01:19:18.481
Now, Mr. Bhanu will sing a song
for you all.

01:19:20.361 --> 01:19:22.961
D-Do I have to sing?

01:19:23.401 --> 01:19:25.841
Yes. Didn't you tell me
the other day that you

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:28.721
would sing songs..
- But that's different.

01:19:28.841 --> 01:19:31.481
How can I sing
that song here?

01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:33.761
Mr. Bhanu, please come.
- Oh, gosh!

01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:36.761
Uncle, what will happen now?
He is..

01:19:39.121 --> 01:19:41.881
Come on.
- Why? - Won't you sing for us?

01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.721
Hey, come on.. - Hey, what the..
- Come on.. - This is unfair..

01:19:45.801 --> 01:19:47.561
What is this?
- Come..

01:19:47.641 --> 01:19:52.161
Please.. - No!- Please sing.
- How can you force me? Go!

01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:58.601
Start. - What?
- Hold it. - What?

01:19:58.681 --> 01:20:00.721
Sing!
- What!

01:19:58.681 --> 01:20:00.721
Sing!
- What!

01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:02.241
Do I really have to?
- Please do it!

01:20:02.321 --> 01:20:03.801
No..

01:20:07.081 --> 01:20:10.121
One! One, two, three, four..

01:20:14.241 --> 01:20:17.601
Uncle, let go of me!
Bhanu will be humiliated!

01:20:17.681 --> 01:20:20.761
Let him be! - Really?
In front of all!

01:20:20.961 --> 01:20:23.201
With me being here!
Never!

01:20:23.281 --> 01:20:25.961
He is my friend after all!
Let me go!

01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:28.441
Here you are..
Thank God you came!

01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:32.761
Do this.. Get out of here..
Go.

01:20:37.161 --> 01:20:44.001
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us. Lord Brahma.."

01:20:44.201 --> 01:20:48.281
"Do we weigh the same?"

01:20:48.321 --> 01:20:55.241
"Yes, we do.."

01:20:57.761 --> 01:21:02.761
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us."

01:20:57.761 --> 01:21:02.761
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us."

01:21:02.841 --> 01:21:05.161
"O' Almighty.."

01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:25.041
"When he weighed
more than me.."

01:21:25.121 --> 01:21:31.681
"I fell down.."

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:40.121
Hey, you collapsed!

01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:41.521
No, I am..
- What do you mean?

01:21:41.601 --> 01:21:44.161
Try and understand..
- I see.. - Wait..

01:21:44.241 --> 01:21:46.161
"The weighing scale
couldn't hold the weight"

01:21:47.161 --> 01:21:49.401
"and I fell down."

01:21:50.201 --> 01:21:54.801
"This story dates back"

01:21:54.881 --> 01:21:59.801
"to those times!"

01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:07.601
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us."

01:22:07.681 --> 01:22:09.961
"O' Almighty.."

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.561
"He has no idea how many.."

01:22:28.681 --> 01:22:34.961
"And you weighed less."

01:22:35.081 --> 01:22:40.801
"Lord,
You are weak and feeble.."

01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:43.281
"That's why You took a leap"

01:22:45.081 --> 01:22:52.801
"and reached heaven.."

01:22:56.001 --> 01:23:01.121
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us."

01:22:56.001 --> 01:23:01.121
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us."

01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:03.601
"O' Almighty.."

01:23:12.561 --> 01:23:15.401
"God, You had created me"

01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:21.161
"by instilling life into me
just once.."

01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:26.441
"But I make You so many times.."

01:23:27.441 --> 01:23:32.961
"And that's the reason I say"

01:23:33.081 --> 01:23:39.201
"I am way stronger
than You!"

01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:47.081
"When Brahma decided to weigh
the two of us."

01:23:47.161 --> 01:23:53.401
"Lord Brahma..
Do we weigh the same?"

01:23:53.761 --> 01:24:01.681
"Yes, we do.."

01:23:53.761 --> 01:24:01.681
"Yes, we do.."

01:24:29.401 --> 01:24:33.241
You here!
- I had something to talk about.

01:24:33.681 --> 01:24:35.081
It's very important.

01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:38.961
Please come.

01:24:47.641 --> 01:24:50.401
Where were you till so late?
- I had some work.

01:24:54.081 --> 01:24:57.321
Do you understand where you
are heading

01:24:57.401 --> 01:24:59.081
overwhelmed by your desire to
become a heroine?

01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:02.081
I am not blind. - But you
have chosen the wrong path.

01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:02.081
I am not blind. - But you
have chosen the wrong path.

01:25:02.161 --> 01:25:04.321
The wrong path!
- Yes, the wrong path.

01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:08.321
We have our eyes fixed
on the same prey.

01:25:08.961 --> 01:25:11.641
The prey might give us the slip
but we may well end up

01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:14.841
hurting each other.

01:25:15.201 --> 01:25:17.681
I didn't quite understand
what you meant.

01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:21.081
Don't act too innocent, Mini.

01:25:22.081 --> 01:25:24.881
You have to forget Bhanu.
- Why?

01:25:25.201 --> 01:25:29.601
I need him.
- So do I. - I see.

01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:37.641
Are you challenging me?
- No!

01:25:38.161 --> 01:25:40.881
I just accepted your challenge.

01:25:48.521 --> 01:25:52.201
I didn't feel bad
that she challenged me.

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:54.441
But do you know
what got me upset?

01:25:56.641 --> 01:26:01.121
She cheated on you. She didn't
value you. - Uncle..

01:25:56.641 --> 01:26:01.121
She cheated on you. She didn't
value you. - Uncle..

01:26:01.201 --> 01:26:03.921
She has wooed your friend,
Bhanu, and they are now

01:26:03.961 --> 01:26:07.441
in deep love..
- Stop it.. Uncle!

01:26:09.241 --> 01:26:11.081
I know all that you
say is not wrong.

01:26:12.481 --> 01:26:17.001
But please tell me

01:26:17.281 --> 01:26:20.241
that all you said is a lie!

01:26:20.921 --> 01:26:24.361
Not now! This affects
your liver big time.

01:26:24.761 --> 01:26:27.601
Drink in the evening.
- Really?

01:26:27.961 --> 01:26:31.321
No, Uncle, that cannot happen!

01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:34.241
You are right..

01:26:34.641 --> 01:26:38.761
I must meet my Mini
at once! Mini!

01:26:39.521 --> 01:26:44.281
Mini! Mini!
- This is..

01:26:51.001 --> 01:26:53.401
Jahar.. You!

01:26:54.441 --> 01:26:57.921
So you recognise me!
- I never wanted not to.

01:26:58.001 --> 01:27:01.561
Do you mean it?
- What? - Are you serious?

01:26:58.001 --> 01:27:01.561
Do you mean it?
- What? - Are you serious?

01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:05.121
Why are you roaming
around with Bhanu

01:27:05.201 --> 01:27:08.121
after breaking up with me?
Tell me!

01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:11.961
Tell me. - As I wish!
- Really?

01:27:16.841 --> 01:27:21.001
Her wish!
How dare she..

01:27:22.441 --> 01:27:23.721
Okay then!

01:27:27.881 --> 01:27:29.761
She has dumped me and she

01:27:29.841 --> 01:27:34.281
slammed the door in my face!

01:27:35.321 --> 01:27:37.441
Who is responsible for this?
Tell me!

01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:41.961
How do I know?
- Oh, really?

01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:48.761
Do you know what this is?
- Yes. But why this?

01:27:48.841 --> 01:27:50.721
This is meant to kill you.

01:27:51.241 --> 01:27:55.081
I will shoot you in your head!

01:27:55.161 --> 01:27:57.401
Hey, we are friends.
- Oh, really?

01:27:57.521 --> 01:28:00.161
You've proved that to me.
- What do you mean?

01:27:57.521 --> 01:28:00.161
You've proved that to me.
- What do you mean?

01:28:00.201 --> 01:28:03.401
You have. - How?
- Are you serious?

01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:06.281
Don't act innocent
and try to deceive me.

01:28:06.401 --> 01:28:08.841
You need to stop going
around with Mini.

01:28:08.921 --> 01:28:10.961
Choose just one!
- Between what?

01:28:11.121 --> 01:28:13.241
Between me and Mini.

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:16.041
Choose one.
- Why should I choose Mini?

01:28:16.121 --> 01:28:19.921
Don't you ever forget this. If
I ever spot you talking to her

01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:21.961
laughing or singing with her

01:28:22.041 --> 01:28:25.041
I shall kill you!
- Do whatever you want

01:28:25.121 --> 01:28:26.961
but take that away!
- Shut your mouth!

01:28:27.041 --> 01:28:28.241
Beware!

01:28:44.121 --> 01:28:46.681
I hope you haven't forgotten
what I told you last night.

01:28:47.521 --> 01:28:52.161
Be careful. You falter
and you are dead!

01:29:38.321 --> 01:29:41.801
'If I spot you talking to her,
laughing or singing with her..'

01:30:18.681 --> 01:30:21.041
'As the artist who was
supposed to come has not'

01:30:21.201 --> 01:30:25.561
'Mahadev Dhuli and co. will
play the dhol and the bell.'

01:30:25.641 --> 01:30:27.521
'A Night of sacrifice.'

01:30:41.681 --> 01:30:42.721
What's wrong, Mr. Bhanu?

01:30:42.801 --> 01:30:45.121
'You must maintain
no ties with Mini!'

01:30:45.201 --> 01:30:46.561
'Choose one!'

01:30:52.121 --> 01:30:56.761
I waited for you the entire day.
But you didn't come.

01:30:57.721 --> 01:30:59.441
You didn't even answer my calls.

01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:05.441
Hey! You are crying!

01:31:05.521 --> 01:31:07.041
Come on! I am being
considered the one spoiling

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.121
your relationship with Jahar.

01:31:09.161 --> 01:31:12.121
What would people think?
How shameful!

01:31:12.961 --> 01:31:17.201
What a shame!
Jahar has gone mad.

01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:21.201
I am in a battle with my
mind over what I want.

01:31:21.881 --> 01:31:25.481
I will fix our relationship
once I become a heroine.

01:31:25.601 --> 01:31:27.881
Let's go.
- No! - What!

01:31:28.681 --> 01:31:29.961
Do you know what Jahar said?

01:31:30.041 --> 01:31:33.201
Do you know what he will do

01:31:33.281 --> 01:31:35.401
if he spots me with you?
He'll shoot me dead!

01:31:36.681 --> 01:31:38.881
So will you let your
fear transform this

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:40.961
into the truth, Bhanu?
- No!

01:31:41.761 --> 01:31:43.601
So, let's go.
- Let's go!

01:31:46.841 --> 01:31:49.681
Wait! - Why? - Let me
get dressed properly!

01:32:07.841 --> 01:32:10.041
Taxi..

01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:14.081
Mr. Bhanu,
what are you thinking?

01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:16.721
How foolish of me!

01:32:17.401 --> 01:32:21.441
His pistol scared me to death!
What a shame!

01:32:21.681 --> 01:32:25.321
Really. Had you not come..
- What would've happened?

01:32:25.561 --> 01:32:28.241
Our love relationship would
have got.. - Stand up..

01:32:28.321 --> 01:32:30.761
I will never repeat this..
- Hey! - What happened?

01:32:30.801 --> 01:32:33.281
Mr. Bhanu.. - Mini!
Where are you going?

01:32:33.361 --> 01:32:35.521
To Mr. Bhanu.
- I won't let you!

01:32:35.641 --> 01:32:38.521
Jahar!
- You will come with me. Yes.

01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:45.081
'What made you think
you escaped?'

01:33:47.281 --> 01:33:48.481
'Stand up!'

01:33:50.921 --> 01:33:54.721
'Hands up! Walk backwards,
towards the door.'

01:33:59.881 --> 01:34:02.321
'I warned you many times
but you didn't pay heed.'

01:33:59.881 --> 01:34:02.321
'I warned you many times
but you didn't pay heed.'

01:34:03.801 --> 01:34:06.881
'Stop!
I will shoot you dead today.'

01:34:06.961 --> 01:34:10.201
No..

01:34:17.881 --> 01:34:20.081
'The drama ends here.'

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.561
'The next announcement
will happen shortly.'

01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:25.761
Why are you mum?

01:34:26.601 --> 01:34:29.241
I don't talk to the one who
wants to fix relationships

01:34:29.401 --> 01:34:34.201
at gunpoint.
- Pistol! Where?

01:34:34.281 --> 01:34:35.481
In your hand.

01:34:37.521 --> 01:34:40.201
This is just a replica.

01:34:41.721 --> 01:34:45.641
Why did you get it then?
- To get Bhanu scared.

01:34:46.361 --> 01:34:49.001
What makes you feel that
if you scare him away

01:34:49.161 --> 01:34:52.441
I'll be all yours?
- No matter what it takes.

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:56.681
I will not sit on my hands.

01:34:56.801 --> 01:34:58.801
I want to claim what is mine!

01:34:58.921 --> 01:35:00.641
And no one can take
you away from me!

01:34:58.921 --> 01:35:00.641
And no one can take
you away from me!

01:35:12.961 --> 01:35:17.241
Bhanu..

01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:21.881
So you are here to
kill me again! No.

01:35:21.961 --> 01:35:24.201
I can't die again..

01:35:24.321 --> 01:35:27.361
I died once, not again..

01:35:31.121 --> 01:35:34.801
Bhanu..

01:35:42.121 --> 01:35:45.961
Catch him..

01:35:46.081 --> 01:35:48.961
Nab him..

01:35:49.041 --> 01:35:51.161
Hey! Let go.
Why me?

01:35:51.241 --> 01:35:55.401
Didn't you call me mad?
- No! Why would I?

01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:58.161
Let go of me!

01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:10.321
Nab him..

01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:14.401
Nab him..

01:36:14.481 --> 01:36:18.641
Bhanu..

01:36:18.801 --> 01:36:22.041
Nab him..
- Bhanu..

01:36:22.721 --> 01:36:26.841
Bhanu..
- Nab him..

01:36:28.481 --> 01:36:30.681
Hey! - Bhanu..
- Wait.. - Nab him.

01:36:30.761 --> 01:36:33.601
Bhanu..
- Nab him..

01:36:40.321 --> 01:36:44.601
Bhanu..
- Nab him..

01:36:54.721 --> 01:36:57.561
Nab him..

01:37:00.121 --> 01:37:04.841
Nab him..
- Come on!

01:37:05.121 --> 01:37:09.641
Bhanu..
- Nab him..

01:37:10.841 --> 01:37:15.041
Nab him..

01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:21.761
Nab him..

01:37:24.681 --> 01:37:27.361
Bhanu..

01:37:29.081 --> 01:37:33.721
Bhanu..
- Nab him..

01:37:43.081 --> 01:37:45.161
Nab him..

01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:57.201
Bhanu..
- Nab him..

01:38:01.681 --> 01:38:05.721
Bhanu..

01:38:13.481 --> 01:38:16.881
Bhanu..

01:38:42.321 --> 01:38:45.601
Come on.. Nab him..

01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:50.521
Come on.. Nab him..

01:39:06.121 --> 01:39:09.401
Come on.. Nab him..

01:39:29.321 --> 01:39:32.401
Bhanu..

01:39:32.481 --> 01:39:34.961
Bhanu..

01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:42.801
Bhanu..

01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:44.361
Bhanu..

01:39:48.281 --> 01:39:52.521
Bhanu..

01:39:52.561 --> 01:39:54.041
Bhanu..

01:40:03.481 --> 01:40:05.961
Bhanu, get down!

01:40:08.281 --> 01:40:10.121
Bhanu!

01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:12.281
Get down!

01:40:12.361 --> 01:40:14.721
Bhanu..

01:40:16.401 --> 01:40:18.921
Bhanu!

01:40:28.721 --> 01:40:31.161
I.. Mukto..

01:40:32.481 --> 01:40:34.241
Y-You! - Why..
- You here!

01:40:34.321 --> 01:40:36.321
Are you cracking a joke
so early in the morning?

01:40:36.401 --> 01:40:38.881
This is where I always was.

01:40:50.401 --> 01:40:52.481
Bhanu..

01:40:53.601 --> 01:40:55.401
Mr. Jahar is calling you.
Open the door.

01:40:55.481 --> 01:40:58.881
Bhanu..

01:40:58.961 --> 01:41:02.321
Bhanu..

01:40:58.961 --> 01:41:02.321
Bhanu..

01:41:02.601 --> 01:41:05.881
Bhanu! Bhanu.. - It hurts..
- Bhanu..

01:41:05.961 --> 01:41:08.561
Let go of me! My belly.
It hurts, let go! - We..

01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:09.921
How can I let you go?

01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:12.841
I'll make you my partner
and take you to Kolkata. - No!

01:41:12.961 --> 01:41:14.961
No.. - Come on! - You have
won the lottery.

01:41:15.081 --> 01:41:16.121
Won't you claim the money?

01:41:16.161 --> 01:41:18.841
No.. I have already
seen a dream before

01:41:18.921 --> 01:41:23.641
I got the money.
So, I better not claim it.

01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:27.241
Did you see a dream?
- It was such a dream!

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:31.521
I went to Kolkata and fell
in love with Mini..

01:41:32.041 --> 01:41:35.681
You shot me but I survived.

01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:38.281
But after that,
I left everyone behind

01:41:38.401 --> 01:41:42.321
and sailed up in the air..

01:41:42.681 --> 01:41:46.561
And soon after
I started flying

01:41:46.681 --> 01:41:50.361
God made me fall on the
ground and made me realise.

01:41:50.441 --> 01:41:52.961
What did He make you
realise? - He made me realise

01:41:53.081 --> 01:41:54.921
that there's no happiness
in scaling heights

01:41:55.001 --> 01:41:58.681
leaving others behind.
No, Jahar..

01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:00.921
Distribute the
money amongst all.

01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:00.921
Distribute the
money amongst all.

01:42:00.961 --> 01:42:03.121
Do it.. - What do you mean
by that? What about you?

01:42:03.201 --> 01:42:05.481
Even I will get my share.

01:42:05.561 --> 01:42:09.961
That will allow me to be
in my house, with her.

01:42:18.081 --> 01:42:21.641
Mukto.. The 10 a.m. train has left.
Give me tea and snacks.

01:42:21.681 --> 01:42:22.801
Right away.

01:42:22.921 --> 01:42:27.961
"You had created me just once.."

01:42:28.201 --> 01:42:29.921
"Just once.."

01:42:30.281 --> 01:42:32.601
"But I make You"

01:42:32.921 --> 01:42:35.041
"many a time"

01:42:35.761 --> 01:42:40.481
"And that makes me
way stronger than You."

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:45.481
"When Brahma decided to
weigh the two of us.."

01:42:45.561 --> 01:42:47.441
"The Almighty.."
