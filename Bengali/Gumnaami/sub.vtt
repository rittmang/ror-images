WEBVTT

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.125
It'll be done, Bapu.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.583
Our members are working on it.

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.166
We'll have to wait till the next meeting
for the rest.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:11.583
I've spoken with Sardar.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:14.042
Come, Subhas.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.100
Greetings, Bapu.
Hello, Jawahar.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.167
Hello, Subhas.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.583
Congratulations on your victory!

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.917
Hope you have an excellent second term.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.316
Congratulations!

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.167
Thank you.
Hope you're happy, Bapu.

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:29.875
I'm very happy.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.750
But...

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:43.292
But there's a small issue, Subhas.

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:47.417
The Congress High Command
is not happy with your attitude.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:48.999
If you still stick to your decision...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.542
of not supporting the British
during the War...

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.082
We'll have to take
some very hard decisions.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:59.417
Whereby I'll be forced to resign, huh?

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:02.215
Listen Jawahar, come what may...

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:07.707
I'll never support the Empire
which mercilessly ruled over
us for 200 years.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:12.333
And I will never support the sacrifice
of Indian soldiers for the British cause.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:15.917
If they have to fight,
they should fight for India, their motherland.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.333
Violence through military struggle,
even in self-defence...

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.458
is not a solution, Subhas.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.792
Non-violence,as shown by Bapu,
has to be the way forward.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.292
Very well.

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:31.358
Let us assume we do go forward.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.832
India does win freedom.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:36.375
And
you are
the first Prime Minister,
Jawahar.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.150
Do you envisage an army, a navy,
and an air force for Free India?

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:45.208
Or do you think the best way
to encounter foreign aggression...

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.291
will be to offer the other cheek?

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:49.167
- Whatever it is...
- Jawahar.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:53.562
Subhas, just think about it.

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:58.910
The British Empire is in a lot of trouble
right now.

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:02.128
If we help them now...

00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:06.739
then I believe,
they'll give in to our demands.

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:11.083
But Bapu, we had helped them
during the First World War too.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.348
What did we get in return?

00:04:13.617 --> 00:04:16.325
Rowlatt Act. Jallianwala Bagh.

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:18.601
It won't be repeated this time.

00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:20.874
I am very certain.

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:24.109
In time, we'll win our freedom.

00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:25.340
How long, Bapu?

00:04:26.277 --> 00:04:27.129
And why?

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:31.292
We shouldn't be begging for freedom.
It's our right!

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:34.167
We can't ask for freedom.
We have seize it from them.

00:04:34.558 --> 00:04:37.183
Your way of thinking
is completely wrong, Subhas.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.528
Violence is not the way.

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:44.708
The only way India can attain independence
is through non-violence.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.792
That's what I believe.

00:05:09.784 --> 00:05:11.042
Please forgive me, Bapu.

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:13.550
I don't agree with you.

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.888
You can fight for freedom
in your own way.

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:19.974
And I'll do it my way.

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:25.822
Bless me so that I can free India
and return to an independent country.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.792
Be victorious, Subhas!

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.004
I'll wait for you.

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:09.542
Subhas, wait!

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.917
Think about it, Subhas.

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.366
You're the Congress President.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.796
Sooner or later,
we'll get our freedom.

00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:20.147
Don't go so far away that it becomes
difficult for you to return.

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.182
Don't worry, Jawahar.

00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:26.748
Doesn't matter how far I go,
I'll come back to meet you.

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:30.438
But I'll return to an independent India.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:53.291
<i>Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here</i>

00:06:53.292 --> 00:07:00.624
<i>The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here</i>

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:08.249
<i>Subhas, Subhas,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:15.332
<i>The hero of India

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:19.374
<i>Subhas, Subhas</i>

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:27.333
<i>Subhas is the heart of India
Subhas is the pride of India</i>

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:37.042
<i>Subhas is the respect of India
Subhas is the dignity of India</i>

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:43.874
<i>Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here</i>

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:51.042
<i>The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here</i>

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:56.125
<i>Subhas, Subhas</i>

00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:24.471
<i>He'll lead a storm called India
He'll bring glory to India</i>

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:34.833
<i>He'll be a terror to the foreign masters</i>

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:41.666
<i>Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here</i>

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:48.833
<i>The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here</i>

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:56.124

00:08:56.125 --> 00:09:03.292
<i>The hero of India

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.249
<i>Subhas, Subhas</i>

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.750
THE UNKNOWN

00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:45.806
Greetings, Your Excellency Kana Kanta!

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.907
My name is Tadamoto Negishi.

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:52.806
I bring news from Honourable Ambassador
in Thailand, Mr. Tsubogaami.

00:09:54.137 --> 00:09:55.556
What is it, Mr. Negishi?

00:09:57.042 --> 00:09:58.774
Have they dropped another bomb?

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:12.857
<i>It's over.</i>

00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:15.131
The Japanese are about to surrender.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.943
Make arrangements.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.326
We'll be moving to Singapore tomorrow.

00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:27.974
And we'll decide
the next plan of action.

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:31.584
As you wish, Netaji.

00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:34.083
I...

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.375
I'll tell the others.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.099
Ayer...

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:45.615
We might have lost the War.

00:10:46.596 --> 00:10:50.179
But the battle against the British
will continue till we're free.

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:52.375
Long live, India!

00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:53.929
Long live, India!

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:13.082
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:17.332
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:21.291
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:25.542
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.833
<i>So many sacrifices... so much struggle...</i>

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:30.292
All for nothing!

00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:31.458
At least, we tried, Habibur.

00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:35.124
This is better than getting kicked around
by those British dogs.

00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:36.500
But what should we do now?

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:38.042
We'll all die if we keep fighting.

00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:39.999
We'll die but in the battlefield.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.375
Those Brits won't ever get their hands
on us.

00:11:42.424 --> 00:11:44.924
I think we should switch to regrouping
and espionage now.

00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:46.741
And the first thing to be done...

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:49.250
is for the Supreme Leader to move away
from Singapore.

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:51.809
No.

00:11:53.417 --> 00:11:54.542
No?

00:11:55.104 --> 00:11:56.104
No.

00:11:56.807 --> 00:11:58.222
INA will surrender.

00:11:58.324 --> 00:12:01.854
The question is whether we'll do it
with Japan or independently.

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:04.249
But sir, what about your plans...

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.041
to wage a guerilla warfare
if the Axis powers...

00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:08.667
Carrying on like this
will only increase the casualty.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.417
Surrendering
will be a better option.

00:12:11.573 --> 00:12:13.375
We might have lost the war...

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.208
but we have shown them...

00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:19.593
that the Indian Army will not fight
for those foreigners anymore.

00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:23.292
But sir, the Allied forces
are very vindictive.

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:25.667
And they've already declared you
as a war criminal.

00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:29.291
- If they capture you alive...
- The most they'll do is they'll hang me till death.

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:30.583
I'm prepared for it.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:34.541
But the sacrifices made by our Azad
Hind Fauj will not go in vain.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.417
What are we going to do now?

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.707
Rehman, tell Stracey to raise a memorial...

00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:46.957
for the INA members
who died here in Singapore.

00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.832
Ayer, prepare for a golden handshake...

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:52.999
for the soldiers of INA
and Indian Independence League.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.958
Three months of salary and ration.

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.582
I've had a word
with the local Japanese commander.

00:12:57.583 --> 00:13:00.958
And he suggested we should go to Bangkok
to consult Minister Hachiya...

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.207
and Lt. General Isoda
about the terms of INA surrender.

00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:06.499
If they can't
help us,
then we'll go to Saigon...

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.624
to meet Field Marshal Count
Hisaichi.

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:09.625
And then decide.

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.000
That will be all, gentlemen.

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:20.041
Long live, India.

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:23.832
<i>March forward, the Tiger of India
Don't be afraid to die</i>

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:27.999
<i>By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation</i>

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.041
<i>March forward, the Tiger of India
Don't be afraid to die</i>

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:36.124
<i>By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation</i>

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:40.082
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:44.667
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:14.582
<i>Let your courage be ever increasing
May The Lord always hear you</i>

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:18.832
<i>As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes</i>

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:22.666
<i>Let your courage be ever increasing
May The Lord always hear you</i>

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:26.916
<i>As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes</i>

00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:30.999
<i>Keep stepping forward

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.250
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.541
Gentlemen, in another few minutes,
there'll
be a Japanese bomber plane...

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:43.542
which will take off for Tokyo.

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.707
With the officers Lt. Colonel Sakai...

00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:51.167
Lt. Colonel Nonogaki, Major Kono
and Major Takahashi.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.833
There are only two seats
which are available.

00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:57.495
So gentlemen, I'll have to take
your leave for this journey.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.917
And I promise to meet you later.

00:15:00.023 --> 00:15:02.231
Please
continue the operation
as instructed.

00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:04.292
And please keep the gold safe.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.121
Who is going to accompany you?

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:08.166
You shouldn't go alone.

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:08.958
He's right.

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.292
Japan is ready to surrender.

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:12.583
The Allied forces will take over Tokyo
any moment.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.578
And you want to go there alone?

00:15:14.825 --> 00:15:15.963
Don't worry.

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.486
Rehman will come with me.

00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:22.625
Rehman is another name for Allah
in Islam.

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:24.167
Nothing will happen to me.

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:56.499
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.750
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.667
I'm feeling very cold, sir.

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.417
I'll get something warm to wear
from the plane.

00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:11.542
Should I get something for you?

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:13.950
I don't need anything.

00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:16.083
I usually don't feel very cold.

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.816
Netaji! Netaji!

00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:21.375
Get up.

00:17:23.887 --> 00:17:25.566
We'll go out the front.

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:55.625
Be careful, Netaji!

00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:39.000
Are you...

00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.458
okay?

00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:30.458
Water! Water!

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:32.292
- Bring some water.
- Right away.

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:34.583
Water!

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.000
Water...

00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:51.416
Is Hasan there?

00:19:51.417 --> 00:19:54.500
No... No...
This is Habibur Rehman.

00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:56.917
Do you need anything?

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:00.583
Tell everyone...

00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:03.299
I fought till the end.

00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:10.000
I think he is a very brave man,
almost inhuman.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.666
I have seen enough
cases
like this.

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:15.708
And you cannot
imagine
the amount of pain.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.583
Will he... survive?

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:22.832
Sadly, no.

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:25.083
Keep fighting.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.917
India will be free soon.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.833
Excuse me, Mr. Rehman.

00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:01.042
He wants to take a photograph
of Kana Kanta.

00:21:03.042 --> 00:21:04.567
No photographs, please.

00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:08.708
I don't want people to see Netaji
like this.

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:24.708
I bring news
from the local
commander.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:28.167
It's not possible to
transport
Kana Kanta's body anywhere.

00:21:28.565 --> 00:21:30.689
The coffin is too big
for
any of the planes.

00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:32.333
That is bad news.

00:21:32.926 --> 00:21:35.384
We can't keep the body like this
for too long.

00:21:35.542 --> 00:21:36.832
So what do we do now?

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:40.250
I suggest cremation.
And at the
earliest.

00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:52.750
<i>The streets and the trees are buzzing
with the Nightingale's song</i>

00:21:55.833 --> 00:22:02.957
<i>The streets are buzzing
with the song of the masses</i>

00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:10.082
<i>Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here</i>

00:22:10.083 --> 00:22:16.958
<i>The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here</i>

00:22:17.292 --> 00:22:22.333
<i>Subhas, Subhas</i>

00:22:25.821 --> 00:22:27.707
<i>And these ashes, My Lord...</i>

00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:31.708
<i>were the ashes which were then taken
to the
Renkoji Temple, Tokyo.</i>

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:35.000
<i>And have been
there
for all these years.</i>

00:22:36.292 --> 00:22:38.666
<i>Various Prime Ministers
and foreign dignitaries...</i>

00:22:38.667 --> 00:22:41.208
<i>have gone there
to pay their
respects.</i>

00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:48.083
My Lord, the circumstances
and exact sequence of events...

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.541
leading to
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's
death...

00:22:51.542 --> 00:22:57.583
have been discussed,
dissected and checked
by so many
agencies.

00:22:57.875 --> 00:23:01.917
Have been confirmed
by so many eye witness accounts.

00:23:02.417 --> 00:23:08.500
Have been tested by so many international
intelligence organisations.

00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:11.382
That there cannot be a shred of doubt...

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:19.356
that Netaji did die on the 18th of
August, 1945 at the Taihoku aerodrome.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.362
Two independent, extensive and credible
commissions...

00:23:24.458 --> 00:23:26.351
the Shahnawaz Committee
and the Khosla Commission...

00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:31.042
were formed at
the behest
of conspiracy theorists.

00:23:31.297 --> 00:23:34.129
And even they upheld the same conclusion.

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:39.350
So, in fact, frankly the third commission
seems like...

00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:42.458
an unnecessary burden
on the public exchequer.

00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.457
But since we
have to go through
the same witnesses...

00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:47.583
- evidences...
- Thank you.

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:54.542
Thank you for your frank opinion about the
need of this Commission, learned counsel.

00:23:55.125 --> 00:23:58.792
But I would appreciate if you stick
to the particulars of the case.

00:23:59.249 --> 00:24:01.790
The person in question
is Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose...

00:24:01.917 --> 00:24:05.042
one of the leading pioneers
of our freedom struggle.

00:24:05.542 --> 00:24:10.957
And whether it is worthwhile to investigate
about the fate of a national hero...

00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:13.542
is something the nation will decide.

00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:16.833
Any other points?

00:24:17.542 --> 00:24:20.833
Any other sequence of
events
you would like to take us through?

00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:24.417
My Lord, I'm sorry.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.625
No, that's all for now.

00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:28.542
- Thank you.
- Please take your seat.

00:24:35.231 --> 00:24:36.398
Excellent!

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:44.583
Now, I would like to call
upon
the founder member of Mission Netaji...

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.375
which is a voluntary
fact-finding organisation...

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:54.167
dedicated to the cause of solving
the mysteries of Netaji's disappearance.

00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:57.083
Mr. Chandrachur Dhar?

00:24:57.583 --> 00:24:59.749
No, he's something else.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.874
The Tiger of Behala!

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:02.249
Best captain of India.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.125
He's an inspiration.
What brilliant strategy!

00:25:05.164 --> 00:25:06.789
- The pep talk...
- What was the point?

00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:08.458
What do you mean?

00:25:09.042 --> 00:25:13.083
How did all the pep talk, strategy,
all the fight help?

00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:14.749
Our team lost the crucial match.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.582
So, you're saying this fight,
this struggle is meaningless?

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:20.291
It reminded me
of a Kulbhushan Kharbanda dialogue.

00:25:20.292 --> 00:25:22.124
The one from 'Shakaal'?

00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:25.042
No, man. What he had said to Asrani.

00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:28.292
The victor is the king.

00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:31.583
What will be written on the scoreboard
100 years from now?

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.333
Winner, Australia.
Winning captain, Ricky Ponting.

00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:36.249
Sourav's name will be
in the footnote.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.749
Neither I nor history has the time
to discuss footnotes.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.249
So, you're trying to say
Porus has no place in history?

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.792
It's all Alexander.

00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:46.417
Now, I'm reminded of Kamal Mitra.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.833
I'm not trying to say it.
I am saying it.

00:25:50.125 --> 00:25:51.458
Boss is looking for you.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.832
Done watching the match?

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:58.207
I was just eating...
They just...

00:25:58.208 --> 00:26:00.292
- Forced you to sit with them.
- Exactly.

00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:02.542
It's the same thing I mean...

00:26:02.708 --> 00:26:06.207
The more I try to change
the work ethics in Kolkata...

00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:07.624
Nothing seems to work!

00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:12.042
All that people are interested in
is either cricket or cinema.

00:26:12.167 --> 00:26:13.167
Anyway.

00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:18.292
- Anyway, what's the score?
- 234.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.208
Couldn't even score 300.

00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:25.208
- Anyway, I have an assignment for you.
- Please tell me.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:28.083
Have you heard
of the Mukherjee Commission?

00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:31.042
The one waiting for Netaji to return.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.707
Are you kidding?

00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:33.999
Shouldn't I?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.249
I've heard all my life
that Netaji isn't dead.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.833
And he'll come back at the right time
to save the country.

00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:41.833
The entire world knows
he died in the plane crash.

00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:45.417
We're lucky Rabindranath Tagore and
Satyajit Ray's deaths are well documented.

00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:47.124
Otherwise, in this iconless country...

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:49.333
they'd have spawned
conspiracy theories as well.

00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:52.125
- Not a Netaji fan, then?
- Not at all.

00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:54.125
I find him very overrated.

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:57.518
In fact, I feel if he stayed with the Congress
he could have done something for the country.

00:26:57.542 --> 00:27:01.708
But he left the party and the country.
That too, to join Hitler's team.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.958
All that's great.
But they didn't even win.

00:27:04.417 --> 00:27:07.749
He built an army
without any military training.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.791
He made friends with the Japanese,
then lost to the Allied forces.

00:27:10.792 --> 00:27:12.249
It was a mess.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.625
He had the courage to fight
the British.

00:27:15.917 --> 00:27:17.667
He could look them in the eye.

00:27:17.792 --> 00:27:21.667
In fact, the INA army had partially won
in Imphal and Arakan.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.791
Dr. BR Ambedkar said in a BBC interview...

00:27:26.792 --> 00:27:30.916
Or Clement Attlee, the British PM
at the time of Independence...

00:27:30.917 --> 00:27:33.041
when he came back to India said...

00:27:33.042 --> 00:27:38.875
"The real reason why the British left India
was not Gandhi.

00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:42.499
But Netaji, his phenomena,
the INA revolt...

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.917
and the naval mutiny which followed."

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.500
What phenomena?
Which mutiny?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.542
I was just telling them.

00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:52.792
The victor is the king.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.249
Only the losing party comes up
with lame excuses.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.832
The fact is we got our independence
because of Gandhi and Nehru.

00:27:58.833 --> 00:28:00.417
Not Subhas Bose.

00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:04.666
That's a different discussion.
We'll save it for later.

00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:07.333
I want you to work on a story.

00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:12.332
Do a story on this... the third commission
that has been set up.

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:14.125
And the mystery around Netaji's death.

00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:17.874
Although you have a strong opinion
about this.

00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:20.292
- But try to keep it neutral.
- Okay.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.500
Keep it neutral and...

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.624
Whatever references you need,
whoever you need to talk to...

00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:27.874
The books you need read,
the documents you need to check...

00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:30.125
Just tell me.
I'll get it arranged.

00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:33.374
- We have a lot of budget for this.
- Really? Wow!

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:37.082
So treat this as an independent inquiry
on behalf of the India Times.

00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:38.124
Okay.

00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.833
- And Chandrachur...
- Yes?

00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:44.792
Make sure this is the most
comprehensive report ever...

00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:47.499
in Indian media on this issue. Okay?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.874
Okay, boss.
Will get going.

00:28:49.875 --> 00:28:52.042
I'll begin from the beginning.

00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:24.957
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:29.124

00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:33.166

00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:37.500

00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:07.832
<i>By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation</i>

00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:11.791
<i>March forward, the Tiger of India

<i>Let your courage be ever increasing
May the Lord always hear you</i>

00:30:54.292 --> 00:30:58.416
<i>As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes</i>

00:30:58.417 --> 00:31:02.374
<i>Let your courage be ever increasing
May the Lord always hear you</i>

00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:06.624
<i>As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes</i>

00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:10.582
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:31:10.583 --> 00:31:14.833
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.916
<i>Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness</i>

00:31:18.917 --> 00:31:23.583
<i>This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her</i>

00:31:54.375 --> 00:31:56.375
Which assignment is this?

00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:58.333
Hmm?

00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:02.000
What's this assignment about?

00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:06.333
It's about Netaji. Why?

00:32:08.833 --> 00:32:12.083
No, I mean, it's been months...

00:32:12.583 --> 00:32:14.958
You've become very distracted.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.292
You're going to sleep late at night.

00:32:19.708 --> 00:32:21.625
Waking up early.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.833
You're not even sleeping.

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.167
You have dark circles
under your eyes.

00:32:27.417 --> 00:32:30.375
And you haven't shaved in a while.

00:32:32.958 --> 00:32:35.083
Why are you so stressed out?

00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:37.167
Hmm?

00:32:39.292 --> 00:32:40.708
What?

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:42.958
Did you hear anything I said?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.167
Huh?

00:32:48.167 --> 00:32:50.083
Roni, what do you think of Netaji?

00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:52.542
I don't think of him.
So, nothing.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.333
What comes to your mind
when you hear the word 'Netaji'?

00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:02.333
Holiday...

00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:06.042
Lazing around, Star Movies...

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:07.708
Why?

00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:17.083
Actually, I had some preconceived notions
about Netaji.

00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:19.917
I'm not saying all of them are gone.

00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:22.417
But the more I'm reading
and finding out...

00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:25.291
the clouds of doubt
are gradually disappearing.

00:33:25.292 --> 00:33:27.167
The sky is clearing up.

00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:34.417
Why are you talking in riddles?

00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:37.292
That man was like a riddle.

00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:40.167
A puzzle which I need to solve.

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:42.666
Too many contradictions.

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:44.207
Maybe a lot of drawbacks too.

00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:46.499
And there's no way
you can deny one thing.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.875
He was the bravest and most intelligent
freedom fighter in our history.

00:33:52.958 --> 00:33:54.125
I see.

00:33:55.042 --> 00:33:58.958
Why is it so necessary...

00:33:59.917 --> 00:34:03.167
to give up on your sleep
to solve this puzzle?

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:08.708
Because it's the first step towards solving the
biggest political mystery of the 20th century.

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:10.792
And what is that?

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:16.917
Did Netaji really die on 18th August
in a plane crash?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.792
Uncle.

00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:44.708
What happened?

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.083
What is it this time?

00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:48.875
Telegram.

00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:52.583
One from Madan Mohan Malaviya.

00:34:53.167 --> 00:34:56.333
And the other one is from Gandhi.

00:34:57.042 --> 00:34:58.167
Why?

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.958
What have they written?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.208
They don't want us perform the last rites
for Subhas.

00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:10.167
What does that mean?

00:35:10.417 --> 00:35:13.500
THE MYSTERY
OF NETAJI'S DISAPPEARANCE

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.458
Watanabe.

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:10.250
What?

00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:13.416
Not what. Watanabe.
Watanabe's testimony.

00:36:13.417 --> 00:36:14.917
What are you talking about?

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.125
What's wrong, baby?

00:36:18.222 --> 00:36:23.013
I just remembered a Japanese interpreter.

00:36:27.625 --> 00:36:28.792
What did you say?

00:36:30.333 --> 00:36:33.250
Your wife is trying to
make love to you.

00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:35.750
And you're thinking
of a Japanese interpreter?

00:36:35.917 --> 00:36:37.582
No, no. It's not like that.

00:36:37.583 --> 00:36:40.291
Actually, Watanabe had said that...

00:36:40.292 --> 00:36:43.083
- Subhas went to Manchuria to go to Russia...
- Subhas again?

00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:47.750
But then why did Habibur Rehman
mention Tokyo?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.292
What happened, Roni?

00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:52.208
Where are you going?

00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:54.625
Roni?

00:36:56.125 --> 00:36:57.333
Roni?

00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:09.166
So as a combined result
of our
successful Quit India Movement...

00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:13.333
and kind co-operation that our brothers
extended in the war against Fascism...

00:37:13.417 --> 00:37:17.124
the Empire has very kindly
agreed to look into our demands...

00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:21.124
relating to Dominion Status
and
Provisional Government.

00:37:21.125 --> 00:37:23.875
And we
would like to dedicate
our success...

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.250
in this struggle for independence...

00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:29.082
to the brave sons
of our beloved
motherland...

00:37:29.083 --> 00:37:32.250
who gave up their lives fighting
for this country.

00:37:33.792 --> 00:37:37.833
I also take this opportunity
to place a plea for clemency...

00:37:37.917 --> 00:37:39.999
for one such brave son...

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.542
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:47.625
I request the Allied powers
not to mark him as a war criminal.

00:37:48.042 --> 00:37:50.333
And to give him the posthumous honour
which he...

00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:51.833
Yes.

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:55.041
Extremely sorry
to interrupt
you, Mr. Nehru.

00:37:55.042 --> 00:37:57.708
This is Alfred Wagg from Chicago Tribune.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.499
I was, in fact, in Taihoku, Saigon
and Bangkok...

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.957
on a spot inquiry
following Mr. Bose's
alleged plane crash...

00:38:03.958 --> 00:38:07.542
in Saigon on August 18, 1945.

00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:10.124
I would like to inform you, sir...

00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:15.625
that I indeed saw Mr. Bose in
Saigon
on the 21st of August.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.542
Subhas?

00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:24.583
I would, therefore, welcome your reaction
on this because we're doing a story now.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.541
I'm... I'm frankly...

00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:31.375
quite surprised
by this recent development.

00:38:32.042 --> 00:38:35.625
I will immediately ask the IB
to look into this claim.

00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:38.624
Believe you me, this is one
rumour I'll be ecstatic about...

00:38:38.625 --> 00:38:40.292
if it turns out to be true.

00:38:41.083 --> 00:38:42.667
Well, thank you, Mr. Nehru.

00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:45.957
But given that Mr. Bose
is a certified war criminal...

00:38:45.958 --> 00:38:48.707
having joinied hands
with Hitler and Tojo...

00:38:48.708 --> 00:38:51.333
and is a sworn enemy of the Empire.

00:38:51.417 --> 00:38:54.958
We do hope that the IB
undertakes this mission zealously.

00:38:55.292 --> 00:38:58.292
In fact, no European
or American agency...

00:38:58.333 --> 00:39:01.458
or for that matter, citizen,
believes that this man is dead.

00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:12.625
<i>Missing my beloved</i>

00:39:16.083 --> 00:39:17.292
Madam?

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.250
We're taking last orders.

00:39:20.292 --> 00:39:22.000
Are you waiting for someone?

00:39:22.042 --> 00:39:24.582
No. Could you please get me the bill?

00:39:24.583 --> 00:39:25.958
Okay, madam.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.542
Happy anniversary.

00:40:14.542 --> 00:40:16.542
Oh, s... t!

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:20.417
Sorry, sorry, sorry, Roni.
I completely forgot.

00:40:20.667 --> 00:40:26.250
I was trying to reconstruct a complicated
event from these documents and...

00:40:26.417 --> 00:40:29.250
Anyway, I'll make it up to you.
Promise. Promise!

00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:42.374
Happy anniversary.

00:40:42.375 --> 00:40:44.833
Yeah, happy anniversary.

00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:46.292
Sorry. Good night.

00:41:00.083 --> 00:41:04.167
Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary!

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.832
Have you gone crazy?

00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:09.250
Do you know how difficult it was
to find these books?

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.874
You're so selfish, Roni.

00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:14.249
What matters to you is just...

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.667
All that matters to you
is the anniversary dinner.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.583
Read about these people, Roni.
Find out about them.

00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:22.958
They've been beaten like animals...
Tortured...

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.457
They've been arrested again and again.

00:41:24.458 --> 00:41:26.667
But they didn't give up.
They freed our country.

00:41:27.625 --> 00:41:29.042
Anniversary, my foot!

00:41:31.042 --> 00:41:32.250
Okay.

00:41:32.375 --> 00:41:36.958
You can live with your toxic patriotism.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.250
I'm leaving.

00:41:38.251 --> 00:41:39.332
- Yeah, okay...
- I'm leaving.

00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:40.916
Yes, please get out!
Leave!

00:41:40.917 --> 00:41:42.157
I'm going to be fine like this.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.500
What is this?

00:41:43.958 --> 00:41:45.542
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:41:45.792 --> 00:41:47.208
What do you mean by resigning?

00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:49.792
I'm quitting the job, sir.

00:41:51.667 --> 00:41:53.292
Does Ronita know?

00:41:55.375 --> 00:41:57.333
She's filing for divorce.

00:41:57.417 --> 00:42:02.667
She can't live with an unstable
and unpredictable man anymore.

00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:05.292
Okay.

00:42:05.583 --> 00:42:10.207
But have you thought about
the decision well or...

00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:12.625
Yes, sir. A lot.

00:42:12.792 --> 00:42:14.375
I thought about it a lot.

00:42:15.542 --> 00:42:21.083
I don't think I can ever do anything else
in my life.

00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:26.917
I can't concentrate.
I can't motivate myself for anything else.

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:30.625
Everything else seems like a waste of time.

00:42:31.167 --> 00:42:34.957
You know... I actually
have to travel a lot.

00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:37.041
Delhi, National Archives,
Taiwan, Bangkok...

00:42:37.042 --> 00:42:38.417
Money?

00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:42.874
I have some savings.

00:42:42.875 --> 00:42:46.957
I'll sell some things off.
I'll manage.

00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:50.541
But what's important is
I have to find out a lot of things.

00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:54.250
- I have to expose and prove to people...
- Listen, listen, Chandrachur...

00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:58.458
What you've written is like a thesis.

00:42:58.667 --> 00:43:00.167
It's brilliant!

00:43:02.083 --> 00:43:05.667
I thought I will speak to the Bombay office
about a raise.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:13.292
And here you are resigning.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.917
Stop the madness.
Don't do this to yourself.

00:43:17.106 --> 00:43:18.898
Raise?

00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:25.625
You know in terms of money, respect and
institution a job at ICS was the best.

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:29.792
And that man had given that up
with a smile.

00:43:31.083 --> 00:43:37.332
Just the last few pieces of the
jigsaw puzzle are missing.

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:39.541
If I can solve it then...

00:43:39.542 --> 00:43:43.707
I can expose the lies
which have been told for the last 60 years.

00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:46.416
Sir, I can send lakhs of history books
to reprint.

00:43:46.417 --> 00:43:49.500
Netaji served the nation.
Whom will you serve?

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.333
I will serve the honour of the man
who served the nation.

00:44:08.458 --> 00:44:11.875
The poison has spread all over, Bapu.

00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:22.333
I had told Jawahar and Sardar...

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:28.708
The partition will cost us dearly.

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:30.957
I know, Bapu.

00:44:30.958 --> 00:44:35.875
When people are taken over by madness
reason stops working.

00:44:36.583 --> 00:44:43.875
The independence we fought so long for...

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.042
Ultimately, it will become this ugly...

00:44:53.333 --> 00:44:55.750
I had never imagined.

00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:01.542
Brothers are killing each other.

00:45:01.658 --> 00:45:05.949
Patel has to work harder
to keep matters under control.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.473
I wish my other son was here today.

00:45:15.789 --> 00:45:18.122
Who? Harilal?

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.284
Not him.

00:45:23.042 --> 00:45:24.667
Subhas.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.166
Subhas?

00:45:27.167 --> 00:45:30.750
But he has passed away.

00:45:31.742 --> 00:45:34.992
No, he's still alive.

00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:36.958
He's in Russia.

00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:44.625
So, this is the end,
my beautiful friend.

00:45:45.792 --> 00:45:46.875
How are you going back?

00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:48.292
Taxi.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.083
Do you need a drop?

00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:51.875
Don't need it.

00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:56.082
Remember to take your meds.

00:45:56.083 --> 00:45:58.167
Pressure in the morning
and the liver at night.

00:45:58.458 --> 00:46:00.419
Otherwise, you won't be able to serve
the country.

00:46:02.417 --> 00:46:04.333
You could have been more patient, Roni.

00:46:04.792 --> 00:46:06.166
You could have been more sensitive.

00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:07.917
Sorry... Sorry.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.250
I know I've said this before but...

00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:11.917
You'll laugh at me but...

00:46:12.042 --> 00:46:14.582
I've gone beyond obsession.
I'm almost possessed by the cause.

00:46:14.583 --> 00:46:16.833
- How did Netaji...
- Again...

00:46:17.153 --> 00:46:18.528
Spare me, Chandra.

00:46:19.667 --> 00:46:23.833
I don't know if Subhas returned home
but because of him I couldn't.

00:46:25.667 --> 00:46:27.208
Of late, it felt like...

00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:29.792
there were three of us living
in the house.

00:46:30.292 --> 00:46:32.292
I hope you'll be normal soon.

00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:33.458
Bye.

00:46:37.083 --> 00:46:40.375
SHYAMAL BASU
SUBHAS NEVER CAME HOME

00:46:47.125 --> 00:46:49.042
Stop the car!
Stop! Stop!

00:46:49.417 --> 00:46:50.417
Stop, stop, stop.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.125
What can I get you, sir?

00:47:05.667 --> 00:47:09.083
- What are you looking for?
- Round framed glasses.

00:47:09.875 --> 00:47:11.667
Got it.

00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:14.542
I don't want sunglasses.
I want plain glasses.

00:47:14.625 --> 00:47:16.333
Normal ones?

00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:17.583
Plain glasses.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.832
Zero power...
Not prescription glasses.

00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:21.917
- I got it.
- No, not that.

00:47:22.167 --> 00:47:23.375
Okay.

00:47:24.167 --> 00:47:27.625
- This one! Show me.
- Yes, sir.

00:47:32.292 --> 00:47:33.417
You're looking good.

00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:39.083
<i>Liberating India
is ours and ours alone.</i>

00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:43.250
<i>That responsibility we shall not cast
on anybody else.</i>

00:47:43.542 --> 00:47:47.083
<i>Because that would be
against our national honour.</i>

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:53.416
<i>Moreover, we have no right to ask for
or expect help from any quarter.</i>

00:47:53.417 --> 00:47:58.750
<i>Until, we ourselves have first of all,
done our very utmost.</i>

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:02.832
I want to thank all of you
for responding to my call.

00:48:02.833 --> 00:48:07.749
My purpose was to create
an unbiased, apolitical...

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.249
and a passionate group of researchers.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.791
So that we can create
an information bank.

00:48:13.792 --> 00:48:15.041
Based on which...

00:48:15.042 --> 00:48:20.916
we can pressurize powerful people
to expose the truth about Netaji's death.

00:48:20.917 --> 00:48:21.958
Okay?

00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:24.000
- Okay.
- Fine.

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.249
One more thing.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.458
Before we start working
we must name our organisation.

00:48:28.542 --> 00:48:29.542
Right?

00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:31.417
Any suggestions?

00:48:31.582 --> 00:48:37.873
Mission Netaji which is a voluntary
fact-finding organisation...

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.582
Dedicated to the cause of solving the
mysteries of Netaji's disappearance.

00:48:43.583 --> 00:48:46.583
Mr. Chandrachur Dhar

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:48.833
Yes, My Lord.

00:48:59.875 --> 00:49:03.041
Mr. Dhar, would you like
a government appointed counsel...

00:49:03.042 --> 00:49:04.458
to argue on your behalf?

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:05.625
No, My Lord.

00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:09.625
I'll present the case myself.
I'll do so mainly in Bengali.

00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:11.750
I object, My Lord.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.417
Either it has to be in Hindi,
our national language.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.999
Or in English, our official language.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.582
I think Mr. Paul is making a mistake.

00:49:21.583 --> 00:49:25.999
Hindi is not our national language.
In fact, we don't have a national language.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.999
According to the Constitution,
all our 22 languages are equally important.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.667
Based on that, all the 22 languages
are national languages.

00:49:31.792 --> 00:49:36.457
English might be our official language,
but if one is not comfortable using it...

00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:38.333
then there should be an
interpreter present.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.249
Since Mr. Mukherjee is a Bengali...

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:44.500
and I believe Mr. Paul used to be Mr.
Pal before...

00:49:44.708 --> 00:49:46.250
there won't be any issues.

00:49:46.417 --> 00:49:49.542
You can get it transcribed
for documentation.

00:49:49.708 --> 00:49:52.458
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.395
Go ahead, Mr. Dhar.

00:49:56.112 --> 00:50:01.820
Please share your research and proof
about Netaji's disappearance.

00:50:02.292 --> 00:50:03.458
Yes, sir.

00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:05.916
I'd like to start by saying...

00:50:05.917 --> 00:50:08.250
it might seem from Mr.
Paul's description...

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.000
that he was on his way to Tokyo
when the plane crashed.

00:50:12.292 --> 00:50:13.292
But no.

00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:15.750
He had no plans to go to Tokyo.

00:50:15.917 --> 00:50:18.166
I need to go to Russia, General Isoda.

00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:22.874
I'm confident that I can improve
the relationship between Russia and Japan.

00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:26.167
And also gather support
for our freedom struggle.

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:31.250
(speaking Japanese)

00:50:37.327 --> 00:50:57.726
(speaking Japanese)

00:50:58.958 --> 00:51:01.499
Going to Russia
will be very difficult now.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.791
Especially after the Japanese surrender.

00:51:03.792 --> 00:51:06.333
And the Russian
control over the skies.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.291
I have to...
I have to go to
Russia!

00:51:09.292 --> 00:51:10.833
It is absolutely necessary.

00:51:11.292 --> 00:51:14.000
Please General Isoda...
Please do something.

00:51:14.167 --> 00:51:15.875
(speaking Japanese)

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.750
Is there anyway we can do this?

00:51:29.917 --> 00:51:36.250
Maybe. If we go to Manchuria
and he gives himself up to the Russians.

00:51:36.542 --> 00:51:41.875
Can we take him there via Darien?

00:51:43.042 --> 00:51:43.625
Possible.

00:51:43.667 --> 00:52:01.997
(speaking Japanese)

00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:06.457
Your Excellency, Kana Kanta,
we can
take you to Darien.

00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:11.417
But after that
you'll have to depend
on your own
resources to go to Russia...

00:52:11.458 --> 00:52:13.333
after we reach Manchuria.

00:52:14.042 --> 00:52:15.667
But what about the plane crash?

00:52:18.437 --> 00:52:19.645
Well...

00:52:21.083 --> 00:52:26.458
Sorry, I might be breaking down
a lot of political palaces...

00:52:27.167 --> 00:52:29.042
But that day...

00:52:29.674 --> 00:52:31.382
I swear there was no plane crash.

00:52:32.875 --> 00:52:33.542
What?

00:52:33.629 --> 00:52:37.129
Yes, we'll have to stage my death.

00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:42.208
And for that I'll need the
help
of some eye witnesses...

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:48.000
which includes officers, soldiers,
local doctors, nurses, priests...

00:52:48.083 --> 00:52:52.083
at the same place
where we decide to enact the crash.

00:52:52.542 --> 00:52:56.124
We need some old
photographs
of an airplane crash...

00:52:56.125 --> 00:52:57.874
at the same place...

00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:02.374
A telegram from Hikari Kikan
mentioning the crash...

00:53:02.375 --> 00:53:06.624
which needs to be planted
with a list of passengers...

00:53:06.625 --> 00:53:09.749
who would be leaving
on that imaginary plane.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.542
Mr. Watanabe, please explain my plan
to Lt. General Isoda.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.499
And please make sure...

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.707
that General Shidei should be
on that imaginary plane...

00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:20.207
because he's coming with me to Darien.

00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:23.750
And he'll be disappearing
for quite some time.

00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:30.292
Rehman.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.875
You'll have to be the special witness
of this accident.

00:53:37.333 --> 00:53:39.458
Your wish is my command, Netaji.

00:53:39.667 --> 00:53:41.125
I'm ready to die for you.

00:53:41.375 --> 00:53:43.625
I need your courage, Rehman.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.292
Not your life.

00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:49.542
The courage to keep repeating
the same story.

00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:52.708
The one we will create right now.

00:53:53.042 --> 00:53:54.624
Remember after surrendering...

00:53:54.625 --> 00:53:58.583
you'll be
questioned by American,
British
and Indian Intelligence.

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.208
And you'll be in all possibilities,
be
tortured.

00:54:06.167 --> 00:54:08.333
But the story shouldn't change.

00:54:10.917 --> 00:54:13.167
The story won't change, Netaji.

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:15.417
Don't worry.

00:54:15.792 --> 00:54:17.999
The story might be imaginary...

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.375
but the scars on my body
from the plane crash...

00:54:22.167 --> 00:54:23.708
would be real.

00:54:24.957 --> 00:54:26.957
I have arranged for some acid.

00:54:35.083 --> 00:54:39.207
You have to keep spreading the news
of my death in India...

00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:42.667
until I come back to free her.

00:54:43.833 --> 00:54:46.707
<i>IB officer, Finney who...</i>

00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:49.249
saw the fake telegram
and questioned the absence of a body...

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:53.292
or even a photo of the body.
He understood.

00:54:53.507 --> 00:55:01.256
He documented Watanabe's testimony as secret
file number 32, reference number: DIB/B/2.

00:55:01.375 --> 00:55:03.458
You can find it in the National Archives.

00:55:04.292 --> 00:55:07.625
Do you want to cross-examine
the witness, Mr. Paul?

00:55:10.958 --> 00:55:12.125
Of course.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.624
Mr. Dhar, according to you,
there was no plane crash.

00:55:15.625 --> 00:55:16.417
No.

00:55:16.418 --> 00:55:17.750
There was no plane crash.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.875
Except for circumstantial evidence...

00:55:20.929 --> 00:55:23.329
do you have any other evidence
that there was no plane crash?

00:55:23.567 --> 00:55:25.983
Do you have any other evidence
apart from circumstantial evidence...

00:55:26.125 --> 00:55:27.268
that the plane actually crashed?

00:55:27.292 --> 00:55:31.167
Mr. Dhar, you can't answer a question
with another question.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:37.250
Why do you think the plane crash
was staged?

00:55:38.823 --> 00:55:40.739
I think so because...

00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:44.018
I have 19 reasons.

00:55:44.167 --> 00:55:45.125
Will you listen to them with patience?

00:55:45.126 --> 00:55:46.458
Nineteen?

00:55:46.542 --> 00:55:48.250
Nineteen!

00:55:49.562 --> 00:55:50.562
Yes, My Lord.

00:55:51.492 --> 00:55:53.533
Firstly, after the famous Bangkok Meeting,
why did Netaji...

00:55:53.667 --> 00:55:57.333
<i>carry four chests of gold,
bid a formal farewell...</i>

00:55:57.417 --> 00:55:59.958
in a way that he would never come back?

00:56:00.417 --> 00:56:03.374
If he was going to discuss
the terms of his surrender...

00:56:03.375 --> 00:56:05.333
then he would have plans to return.

00:56:05.625 --> 00:56:07.707
And why did he take only Rehman...

00:56:07.708 --> 00:56:10.124
<i>on the Japanese bomber plane?</i>

00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:12.124
Where a 12-seater...

00:56:12.125 --> 00:56:13.833
<i>INA plane was ready.</i>

00:56:14.167 --> 00:56:14.625
Okay...

00:56:14.667 --> 00:56:18.250
There's a lot of debate and inconsistencies
about the actual site of the crash.

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.749
Some say it was the runway.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:20.708
Some say out of the runway...

00:56:20.709 --> 00:56:21.958
but inside the aerodrome.

00:56:22.042 --> 00:56:24.124
<i>Some say a little far away
from the aerodrome.</i>

00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:28.417
<i>If we compare the positions of the hills
and the crashed plane...</i>

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.707
<i>then it'll be clear...</i>

00:56:29.708 --> 00:56:32.833
<i>that it is somewhere else,
and some other plane crash's photo...</i>

00:56:32.958 --> 00:56:34.666
<i>Even Habibur Rehman's photo...</i>

00:56:34.667 --> 00:56:37.583
<i>of him in bandages
is extremely unclear and obscure.</i>

00:56:37.708 --> 00:56:42.166
<i>In fact, the aerodrome's officers,
local residents, and Taiwan government...</i>

00:56:42.167 --> 00:56:44.749
<i>has officially declared
that not just on 18th August...</i>

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:48.874
<i>but in 1945, there were no plane crashes
in that entire area...</i>

00:56:48.875 --> 00:56:53.541
<i>The last crash that happened
was in September, 1944...</i>

00:56:53.542 --> 00:56:56.791
<i>The way the plane crashed
is another subject of controversy...</i>

00:56:56.792 --> 00:56:57.893
<i>Some say the wings caught fire.</i>

00:56:57.917 --> 00:56:59.207
<i>Some say the engine had burst.</i>

00:56:59.208 --> 00:57:00.791
<i>Some say the propeller fell out.</i>

00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:03.499
<i>Different eye witenesses
have different versions.</i>

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.832
<i>Some say Netaji escaped first.</i>

00:57:04.833 --> 00:57:05.999
<i>Some say Rehman escaped first.</i>

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.458
<i>Some say the Rehman helped Netaji
to put out the fire.</i>

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.500
<i>Some say Rehman was unconscious
and the Japanese put out the fire.</i>

00:57:11.583 --> 00:57:14.041
<i>In fact, there are different versions of the
description of Netaji's scars and burns.</i>

00:57:14.042 --> 00:57:17.291
Rehman says Netaji's forehead
had a four inch deep scar...

00:57:17.292 --> 00:57:20.374
<i>Dr. Yoshimi who was treating Netaji
had said there was no scar...</i>

00:57:20.375 --> 00:57:23.333
<i>He also said Netaji's blood
had turned black and thick...</i>

00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:25.624
<i>He had to go through a blood transfusion.</i>

00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:29.332
<i>Whereas his assistant, Tsuruta,
has refuted it.</i>

00:57:29.333 --> 00:57:31.999
Ultimately, the fact that in 1945,
in the Taipei airport...

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.624
<i>Netaji had passed away from the burns
he suffered, there's no proof.</i>

00:57:37.625 --> 00:57:40.374
<i>There are no hospital records
or mention in the airport log books.</i>

00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:42.207
<i>There are no police
or fire department documents.</i>

00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:49.417
<i>There's no mention in the crematorium
register of Netaji or any other casualty.</i>

00:57:50.042 --> 00:57:52.082
Yoshimi and Tsuruta have said...

00:57:52.083 --> 00:57:54.707
<i>only one death certificate
for Kana Kanta was issued.</i>

00:57:54.708 --> 00:57:57.667
Although, the cause of death
according to them are different.

00:57:57.792 --> 00:57:59.207
A bigger reason for suspicion.

00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:02.958
There was only one crematorium permit
issued based on the death certificate...

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.749
<i>which was for Ichiro Okura...</i>

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.042
a Japanese citizen.

00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:09.041
He was born in 1901.

00:58:09.042 --> 00:58:11.707
He died of heart problems
and not from burns.

00:58:11.708 --> 00:58:15.791
As for General Shidei and other victims
of the crash, even that was never found.

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:18.791
<i>No one has seen the dead bodies
of such celebrated officers...</i>

00:58:18.792 --> 00:58:20.082
No one attended their funeral.

00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:21.792
There are no reports of their deaths.

00:58:21.875 --> 00:58:24.250
So many people just disappeared
into the thin air.

00:58:25.333 --> 00:58:26.999
Do you want some water?

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.042
I don't want water,
I just need justice.

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:30.250
Just a little justice.

00:58:30.667 --> 00:58:31.667
It's okay.

00:58:31.958 --> 00:58:32.958
Are you done?

00:58:33.208 --> 00:58:34.917
- Are you done with your 19 reasons?
- No.

00:58:35.292 --> 00:58:36.292
I gave you 14 reasons.

00:58:36.333 --> 00:58:38.774
The details of which I've already submitted
to the Commission.

00:58:38.917 --> 00:58:42.917
For the rest of the five reasons, I would
request Mr. Paul to read my two books.

00:58:43.125 --> 00:58:46.332
I've quit my job to run Mission Netaji.

00:58:46.333 --> 00:58:48.749
It would help me if you bought the book.

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:50.707
If you find something illogical in the book
you'll get your money back.

00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:52.125
That's my guarantee.

00:58:57.542 --> 00:58:59.500
Okay. Okay.
Can we get back to the real issue?

00:58:59.833 --> 00:59:03.375
The earlier detailed Commissions
set up by the Government...

00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:05.707
<i>the Shahnawaz Committee of 1956...</i>

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.791
<i>and the Khosla Commission of 1970...</i>

00:59:07.792 --> 00:59:08.583
<i>What about those?</i>

00:59:08.792 --> 00:59:10.542
What about their reports?

00:59:10.708 --> 00:59:15.124
They had come to the conclusion
after unbiased research and investigation.

00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:17.458
That Netaji died in the plane crash.

00:59:18.542 --> 00:59:19.917
Yes, sir. You're right.

00:59:20.083 --> 00:59:20.875
That's right.

00:59:20.917 --> 00:59:23.332
Their findings were very
detailed and unbiased.

00:59:23.333 --> 00:59:29.458
So much so, that our then PM, Morarji Desai,
rejected both in 1978 for the lack of credibility.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.291
It was so unbiased...

00:59:31.292 --> 00:59:35.457
even though there were several flaws
in the plane crash theory...

00:59:35.458 --> 00:59:38.207
both Commissions covered it up
and told the Government...

00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:39.684
exactly what the Government wanted to hear.

00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:40.832
It was so detailed that...

00:59:40.833 --> 00:59:44.124
<i>the dissentient report submitted by Bose's
brother to the Shahnawaz Committee...</i>

00:59:44.125 --> 00:59:46.583
<i>even forced Nehru to agree...</i>

00:59:46.625 --> 00:59:51.208
<i>that there's no irrefutable proof
that Subhas Bose died in the plane crash.</i>

00:59:51.417 --> 00:59:52.458
It was so unbiased...

00:59:52.958 --> 00:59:57.542
that they ignored capable judges like Radha
Binod Pal who was there in the Tokyo trial...

00:59:58.125 --> 01:00:01.458
and appointed Khosla
who was openly anti-Subhas.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.208
Then giving him a huge post in the
Government after the verdict.

01:00:05.292 --> 01:00:07.000
It was so detailed...

01:00:07.292 --> 01:00:11.083
that the entire Commission was run
in an air conditioned room in Delhi.

01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:13.875
And another one, although
with great reluctance, in Taiwan.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:18.542
But more energy was spent on shopping for
the then PM rather than the investigations.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:21.250
You're making this political, Mr. Dhar.

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:23.958
Which anti-Congress party
are you a member of?

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:27.083
BJP, RSS, Bajrang Dal
or Forward Bloc?

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:28.916
I'm not a political party cadre, Mr. Paul.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.875
I'm a soldier of the Azad Hind Fauj.

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:32.542
I'm sure you've heard of it.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.250
Or do you want to set
up another commission?

01:00:35.333 --> 01:00:37.917
Okay, that'll be all gentlemen.

01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:39.250
Okay.

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:41.083
Okay.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:46.042
The commission
will look into
the entire plane crash theory with proof...

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:49.333
testimonials and the government
documents
you have furnished.

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:54.083
I, personally, will travel to Taiwan,
Japan and Bangkok...

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:56.875
to investigate
the claims
and the counter claims.

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.292
But tell me something, Mr. Dhar.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:06.625
If Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
did not die in the plane crash...

01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:09.167
then where did he go?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.917
I mean, according to your theory.

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:42.917
Coming.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:46.042
Wait... I'm coming...

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:47.667
Who is it?

01:01:47.668 --> 01:01:49.917
Open the door, Mishra.
The CM is here.

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.333
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.875
Hope all is well with you, Mahadeo.

01:01:57.917 --> 01:02:01.333
- Yes, My Lord.
- I'm not your lord.

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:03.792
He's sitting inside.

01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:06.625
- Yes, that's true.
- Hello.

01:02:06.792 --> 01:02:09.708
He's expecting you.
Please come this way.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.125
- Let's go.
- This way.

01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:18.083
Watch your step.

01:02:44.542 --> 01:02:45.958
Greetings, Babaji!

01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:48.708
Welcome, Sampooran.

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:51.625
Have you brought the books on Tantra?

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.167
Yes, Babaji.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.875
Here they are.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:57.083
That's great.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.167
Tell me something, son.

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:04.958
How long has our country
been independent?

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:06.542
It's been eight years, Babaji.

01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:08.417
Eight years.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.083
Tell me.

01:03:12.833 --> 01:03:18.541
Is there a triple arch on the facade
of the UP Legislative Assembly?

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:20.291
Yes, Babaji. Yes.

01:03:20.292 --> 01:03:24.750
There's a symbol there
from before the independence.

01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:27.333
A star.

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:31.375
An occult-imperialist symbol.

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:35.208
A memento of the British rule
and oppression.

01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:36.583
Really?

01:03:37.167 --> 01:03:39.208
I've never noticed.

01:03:40.042 --> 01:03:41.749
But if you're saying it might be there...

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:45.042
I am certain it's there.

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:49.375
But it shouldn't be there
after eight years of independence.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.000
Isn't it, Sampooran?

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:54.625
It won't be there from tomorrow, Babaji.

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:56.833
There's one more thing.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.875
I got a letter from Benarasi.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:02.458
Do you agree with him?

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:03.833
Yes, Babaji.

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.792
It's probably not my place to say it...

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:10.542
The relationship Delhi now
has with the other countries...

01:04:10.667 --> 01:04:13.000
You should be a little careful.

01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:15.166
Therefore, on behalf of UP Government...

01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:16.958
and in my personal capacity...

01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:19.375
let me arrange for a security cover.

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:22.125
Then you can stay here
without any worry.

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:24.583
Thank you.

01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:27.458
Babaji, there's something else.

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:34.958
Mishra told me
you spend the entire night coughing.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:38.333
Let me send you a better heater
and some more blankets.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.125
If that's okay with you.

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:41.958
There's no need.

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:45.000
I usually don't feel very cold.

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:50.250
This body has experienced
the frost of Siberia.

01:04:52.167 --> 01:04:54.125
I'll take your leave now, Babaji.

01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:56.333
Okay.

01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:59.417
- Goodbye, Babaji.
- Goodbye.

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:57.875
<i>The light of my lamp died
while I walked this lonely path</i>

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:07.833
<i>The light of my lamp died
while I walked this lonely path</i>

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:17.250
<i>A storm brews, oh dear!</i>

01:06:18.625 --> 01:06:23.707
<i>The storm offers me company</i>

01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:31.708
<i>The light of my lamp died
while I walked this lonely path</i>

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:38.458
<i>While I walked this lonely path</i>

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.957
<i>My Lord, a lot of people believe
in the plane crash theory...</i>

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:48.125
Many of Netaji's family members including
his wife, the late Emily Schenkl...

01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:50.624
his brothers, Sarat and Suresh
and their children.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:52.166
And a lot of other people believed...

01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:54.792
that he didn't die in the plane crash.

01:06:55.583 --> 01:07:00.083
But there are a lot of theories and debates
about what happened after that.

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:02.375
<i>Some believe he fled to Russia.</i>

01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:05.917
<i>He was taken prisoner there,
tortured and murdered.</i>

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.583
My personal theory is...

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.292
<i>after his staged plane crash...</i>

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:13.667
<i>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
went to Russia.</i>

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:17.958
<i>He spent some time in
Stalin's Gulag in Siberia.</i>

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:21.667
<i>Then he went to China in 1950.
And onto Tibet.</i>

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:26.542
<i>He started delving in yoga,
spirituality and tantra...</i>

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:30.707
<i>Then he finally became a monk.</i>

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:35.125
<i>He entered India through Nepal
with the help of Mahadeo Mishra.</i>

01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:36.917
<i>A monk?</i>

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.042
<i>Oh yes!</i>

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:41.250
Netaji became a monk?

01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:47.542
My Lord, what kind of nonsense is he saying
about a national hero like Netaji?

01:07:47.875 --> 01:07:49.624
What audacity!

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:54.291
My Lord, I request the Commission
not to waste time on these stupid theories.

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:56.583
Excuse me...
Mr. Paul... Mr. Paul...

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:58.666
Please remember,
according to what you said...

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:02.250
a great national hero like Netaji
is no one's personal property.

01:08:02.417 --> 01:08:04.417
If you are a relative,
not even then.

01:08:04.833 --> 01:08:07.750
The actual surname
of all free Indians is Bose.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.208
Because they're all
members of Bose's family.

01:08:10.292 --> 01:08:11.750
I'll share my theory.

01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:13.726
And I'll present my theory
with witnesses and proof in support.

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.582
Please feel free to disagree.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:18.417
It doesn't matter to me
or my countrymen.

01:08:26.583 --> 01:08:31.416
All that is fine but...
Russia, China, a monk...

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:35.541
My Lord, I think Chandrachur
is smoking some great weed.

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:39.875
Otherwise, he wouldn't waste our time
with these fantasies.

01:08:40.208 --> 01:08:41.458
You're absolutely right, sir.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.250
It's the same weed Ardhendu Sarkar
used to smoke.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:44.958
What?

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.167
Ardhendu what?

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:47.667
Sarkar.

01:08:47.708 --> 01:08:49.417
Ardhendu Sarkar.

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:52.917
I am a post graduate
in mechanical
engineering from UK.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:55.791
And I am the Chief Engineer
in the Heavy
Engineering Corporation.

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:56.916
Yes, tell me.

01:08:56.917 --> 01:08:58.292
Right, sir.

01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:04.083
My senior at the plant, Mr. BA Zerovin
was a German Jew.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.208
And he was once in Stalin's Gulag...

01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:12.124
which is located beyond the ends
of Trans-Siberian Railways...

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:13.791
in the vicinity of Ural mountains.

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:15.333
Okay, go on.

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:23.625
Sir, he told me that...

01:09:25.083 --> 01:09:31.417
he met Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose once
in the Gulag in 1948.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.417
<i>He was being treated well.</i>

01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:35.375
<i>Even given a car.</i>

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.417
<i>And he was moving around
with a couple of guards there.</i>

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.958
<i>But the most important thing is that...</i>

01:09:43.583 --> 01:09:47.750
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose told Zerovin...

01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:53.750
that he would be going back to India
very soon.

01:09:57.458 --> 01:10:02.333
Mr. Sarkar,
you're a mechanical engineer, right?

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:03.708
Yes, sir.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:07.166
Was Netaji also a mechanical engineer?

01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:08.750
Certainly not, sir.

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:12.833
Then how is this information
relevant to you?

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:15.375
No, sir... Actually...

01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:16.667
I mean...

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.541
I being an Indian who...

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:21.875
Who has come here to work
as an engineer.

01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.458
Not as a private eye.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:28.417
So if he pokes his nose
into matters of politics I'm afraid...

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:33.167
I cannot guarantee the safety
of his nose.

01:10:33.542 --> 01:10:36.417
Or any other part of his body
for that matter.

01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:38.375
Is that clear?

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.292
Yes, sir.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:41.750
Yes.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.457
Just one other thing...

01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:45.999
Could you please repeat
what you just told me?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:46.708
Of course.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.792
My senior Mr. Zerovin had...

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:57.042
I mean I...

01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.917
I really don't remember...

01:11:01.917 --> 01:11:04.417
whatever I have told you right now.

01:11:05.703 --> 01:11:06.703
Excellent!

01:11:07.167 --> 01:11:08.917
Remember that you don't remember.

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.300
You may leave now.

01:11:11.445 --> 01:11:14.820
That day he returned home terrified.

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:18.958
After that, he didn't say anything
to anyone for years out of fear.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:21.070
Until, I interviewed him
last year.

01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:22.721
Okay.

01:11:23.125 --> 01:11:26.750
This Commission will record his testimony.

01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:30.292
Do you think we should call
any other witnesses?

01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:31.833
Yes, My Lord.
I think so.

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:37.124
Famous Tibetologist, Rahul Ram
could have provided a strong testimony.

01:11:37.125 --> 01:11:40.207
Whereby, my theory
would've been proved beyond doubt.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:41.208
But...

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:42.917
We're late.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.207
In fact, the pre-RAW, Ministry of External
Affairs' Govt. Intelligence Officer...

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:50.542
he was late too.

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:55.583
Yadav, I have a secret.

01:11:56.125 --> 01:12:00.958
I won't be able to die in peace with it.

01:12:01.042 --> 01:12:02.417
Nothing will happen to you.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.375
Keep quiet.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:04.333
The doctor's on his way.

01:12:04.334 --> 01:12:06.042
- Don't talk.
- Please let me speak.

01:12:07.292 --> 01:12:10.875
I don't have much time.

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:13.292
Okay, tell me.
Go ahead.

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:18.958
Do you remember Babajaan Gouffral?

01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:22.167
Gouffral... That Soviet official?

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:24.291
He was a good friend of Stalin.

01:12:24.292 --> 01:12:25.833
He was quite close to you too.

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:27.083
Yeah.

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:28.333
Yes.

01:12:28.458 --> 01:12:30.167
He once told me...

01:12:30.625 --> 01:12:36.083
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1945...

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:41.750
had entered Russia through Manchuria.

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:43.083
What?

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:46.250
- But the plane crash...
- Was a lie!

01:12:46.417 --> 01:12:49.792
I'm not making this up.

01:12:52.292 --> 01:12:54.000
This is the truth.

01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:56.750
And you...

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.625
You will share this information
with everyone...

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:09.042
when this country is ready
to hear the truth about Netaji.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:12.875
And this was his dying declaration.

01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:14.249
So, Mr. Paul...

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:18.042
there were other famous people
smoking the same weed.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:19.957
Anyway, let me get back to main issue.

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.332
Let me tell you
about the mysterious old man.

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:26.000
He had a lot of different names.

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:30.875
Like Pardewale Baba,
Anaam Sant,
Bhagwanji or...

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:34.000
Gumnaami Baba.

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:38.582
<i>When Netaji settled in Lucknow in 1955...</i>

01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:41.457
<i>to live the rest of his life in secret...</i>

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.999
<i>he didn't know it then...</i>

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.708
<i>that a moment of carelessness...</i>

01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:47.749
<i>could expose his secret.</i>

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:52.125
<i>And that he would have to keep moving
all over Uttar Pradesh frequently.</i>

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:56.833
<i>Because people got to know his
real identity in just a few days.</i>

01:13:58.292 --> 01:14:02.125
- Please come in, Guruji. This way.
- Greetings!

01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:08.750
Please come in.

01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:16.708
I've heard Mr. Gandhi used to
get his glasses from here.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.500
Yes, Guruji.

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:22.125
But how does that...
I mean...

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.375
You don't have a...

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:27.791
Maybe, our visions are different.
Even the far-sighted ones.

01:14:27.792 --> 01:14:32.458
But that doesn't mean
we can't buy glasses from the same shop.

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:38.750
Guruji, please check if
you can read clearly.

01:14:38.792 --> 01:14:40.458
This is correct.

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:42.458
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:47.792
We're done here.
Let's select a frame now.

01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:49.375
Let's go.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.333
Oh my God! Netaji!
Netaji is sitting here.

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:40.708
Come and see.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:42.958
How did you come here?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.083
That's not Netaji.
Please move.

01:15:49.333 --> 01:15:50.333
<i>Brilliant!</i>

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.500
You should have been a screenplay writer!

01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:55.792
Anyway, tell me, Mr. Dhar.

01:15:56.125 --> 01:16:01.375
How did an activist, a
fiercely political man...

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:07.125
suddenly became a god-fearing,
shy monk in hiding?

01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:08.208
How?

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:09.917
Suddenly, sir.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:16.082
Just like a brown Sahib who made racist
comments against the African natives...

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:19.375
suddenly became a cotton loincloth
wearing 'Mahatma'.

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:21.542
Just like a bomb making daredevil...

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:23.000
but a violent revolutionary...

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:26.333
suddenly became a peace loving
and spiritual guru.

01:16:26.958 --> 01:16:29.708
That's life, sir. Life.

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:33.167
Life and it's different ways.

01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:35.875
It can change you forever.

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:40.124
Though unlike Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
or Aurobindo Ghosh...

01:16:40.125 --> 01:16:44.917
Netaji's transformation was not sudden
or unexpected.

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:48.042
He had a history of spirituality.

01:16:48.708 --> 01:16:53.042
In his youth, he had run away from home
several times in search of a teacher.

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:57.750
He knew the the ancient religious texts
by heart.

01:16:58.208 --> 01:17:01.292
He prayed to Goddesses Durga,
Kali and Shakti.

01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:03.875
He regularly practised yoga.

01:17:03.958 --> 01:17:05.375
I get that.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:09.957
But do you have any admissable evidence
apart from your stories?

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:14.792
Someone who knew him...
Old friends, relatives, companions...

01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:17.332
People who knew that Gumnaami Baba
as Netaji.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:22.000
Do you think I'll waste your time
if I didn't have the evidence?

01:17:22.292 --> 01:17:25.875
There are many relatives
and friends like that.

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:28.167
People who had recognised him as Netaji.

01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:31.792
And there are signs of this recognition
in letters written to Gumnaami Baba...

01:17:31.917 --> 01:17:36.333
that prove beyond doubt and which I have
already submitted to the Commission.

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:37.832
But among them...

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:40.207
I want to mention two people specially...

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:43.333
who after they recognised him...

01:17:43.708 --> 01:17:46.083
reacted in two different ways.

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.333
<i>Greetings!</i>

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:49.291
My name is Atul Sen.

01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:50.958
<i>I have come from Calcutta.</i>

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:54.042
<i>I want to meet Pardewala Baba once.</i>

01:17:54.417 --> 01:17:56.249
<i>He doesn't meet anyone.</i>

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:59.082
<i>Even if he speaks to someone,
he stays behind a curtain.</i>

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:01.207
<i>I've come a long way.</i>

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:03.082
<i>I've heard a lot about him.</i>

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:07.125
<i>Even if I got a chance to hear him,
I would be at peace.</i>

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:11.417
How are you, Atul?
How is your family?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.625
You... You...

01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:17.917
I mean... I bow to you, Guruji.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.708
You've always spoken Hindi with a
Bengali accent, just like me, Atul.

01:18:23.781 --> 01:18:27.656
So, say whatever you want
in Bengali.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.750
You, I mean... You...

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:31.208
Are you surprised?

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.833
Are you really him?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:37.875
The one who helped me
win the Dhaka Municipal elections?

01:18:39.793 --> 01:18:40.793
No.

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.000
He has died.

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:47.000
That man is dead.

01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:49.457
<i>Mine is not mere belief
but actual knowledge...</i>

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.957
<i>that Netaji is alive
and is engaged in spiritual practice...</i>

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:54.041
<i>somewhere in India.</i>

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:56.582
<i>I deliberately make the
location a little vague...</i>

01:18:56.583 --> 01:19:00.333
<i>because of the talks I had with him
for months together not very long ago.</i>

01:19:00.375 --> 01:19:05.041
<i>I could understand that he is yet regarded
as enemy number one of the Allied powers.</i>

01:19:05.042 --> 01:19:06.541
<i>And there's a secret protocol...</i>

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:11.208
<i>that binds the
Government of India
to deliver him
to Allied justice if found alive.</i>

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:18.124
<i>Despite being asked to keep it a secret,
Atul Sen wrote to Pundit Nehru.</i>

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:20.166
<i>And surprisingly, Pundit Nehru...</i>

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:24.874
<i>despite his supported theory
of Netaji dying in a plane crash...</i>

01:19:24.875 --> 01:19:27.707
<i>took the letter very seriously.</i>

01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:29.958
<i>And he personally replied to the letter.</i>

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:32.708
<i>Because of Prof. Atul
Sen's over excitement...</i>

01:19:32.792 --> 01:19:35.250
<i>he never got to see Gumnaami Baba again...</i>

01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:39.208
<i>Dr. Pabitra Mohan Roy's case
was on the other side of the spectrum.</i>

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.458
<i>A trusted comrade of Netaji.</i>

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.750
<i>One of the four members
of the INA's secret service.</i>

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:49.667
<i>Who had travelled to Kolkata in a submarine
to handle the guerilla units of INA.</i>

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:53.208
<i>He immediately recognised Netaji
in the Gumnaami Baba outfit.</i>

01:19:53.833 --> 01:19:55.249
<i>But this information...</i>

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:59.208
<i>he kept it a secret
till the last day of his life.</i>

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.041
<i>After Gumnaami Baba's death...</i>

01:20:01.042 --> 01:20:05.249
<i>when the Police and CBI
found hundreds of letters written to him...</i>

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:09.583
<i>where it became clear that he was
addressing Gumnaami Baba as Netaji.</i>

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:12.583
<i>He faced gruelling interrogation.</i>

01:20:12.792 --> 01:20:16.625
There are similarities between Gumnaami
Baba and Netaji's handwriting.

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:22.917
Can you please tell me clearly
whether he was or wasn't Netaji?

01:20:23.667 --> 01:20:27.333
I could never understand
if he was Netaji or not.

01:20:31.917 --> 01:20:33.750
You have some letters from him.

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:35.208
Show it to us.

01:20:36.292 --> 01:20:38.458
I had received a few letters.

01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:41.250
But I didn't keep them.
I've thrown them away.

01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:44.708
But then who was he?

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:48.000
I don't know.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.458
We've a lot of things belonging to Netaji
in Gumnaami Baba's room.

01:20:55.013 --> 01:20:57.138
What's your opinion on the matter?

01:20:58.542 --> 01:21:01.249
Some say he's alive.
Others say he isn't.

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:03.375
What do you have to say?

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:06.583
What does it matter what I say?

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:12.083
Didn't you ever feel that Gumnaami Baba
could be Netaji?

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:17.499
I've never met him face to face.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:22.833
But you've heard both their voices.

01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:25.917
Did they sound alike?

01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:32.750
Was Gumnaami Baba a Bengali?

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:36.125
Yes.

01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:41.250
Dr. Roy, can you deny
that he was Netaji?

01:21:41.625 --> 01:21:43.167
What do you want me to deny?

01:21:43.417 --> 01:21:45.708
I've already told you
what I had to say.

01:21:46.917 --> 01:21:51.667
But what will we tell the police
and people of Faizabad?

01:21:52.042 --> 01:21:54.292
Tell them what I told you.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.750
But they're all saying that he's Netaji.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:04.458
Then let what's happening, happen.

01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:10.625
But Pabitra Mohan Roy
ultimately didn't say anything.

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:15.292
He kept the whole thing
shrouded in doubt.

01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:19.833
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dhar.

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:23.625
We'll notify your next date of testifying.

01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:26.417
The Commission is adjourned for the day.

01:22:29.917 --> 01:22:32.207
- What are you doing here?
- Get in.

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:33.582
- What's the matter?
- Get in the car. We need to talk.

01:22:33.583 --> 01:22:35.500
- What?
- Come on.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:39.875
What is it?

01:22:40.792 --> 01:22:43.458
Get rid of the cigarette.
I want to switch on the AC.

01:22:49.167 --> 01:22:50.666
What are you researching on now?

01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:52.375
What else?
Netaji. Gumnaami Baba.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.458
I've formed a group called Mission Netaji.
Why?

01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:56.249
I mean is it dangerous?

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.667
What has happened?

01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:01.417
I got a call last night.
He was speaking in Hindi.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.833
Asked me to warn my ex-husband.

01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:06.542
To not play with fire.
Not delve into Netaji...

01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:08.167
To go back being a journo.

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:08.958
What did you say?

01:23:08.959 --> 01:23:11.917
I said if I don't help, you'll
kill him right? Please kill him.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.417
I'll help in whatever way I can.

01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:15.375
The a... e doesn't deserve to live.

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:16.750
He just hung up.

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:23.250
Are you trying to help?

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.667
Do you have a sniper back there?

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.125
Stop kidding.

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:30.083
You've done whatever you want
all your life.

01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:31.496
You've never listened to me.

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:33.625
Please listen to me.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.417
Do something else.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:37.458
Too late for that, Roni.

01:23:37.833 --> 01:23:40.000
The problem are these glasses.

01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:42.250
I see everything through them.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.958
Okay. Do whatever you want.

01:23:45.375 --> 01:23:47.875
How have you been?
Do you miss me?

01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:49.458
Why should I?

01:23:49.833 --> 01:23:50.833
No way.

01:23:53.792 --> 01:23:55.917
You're just incorrigible.

01:23:57.208 --> 01:23:58.583
Flirting with your ex-wife?

01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:01.833
Today the testimony
which this
Commission will examine...

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:05.750
in the matter of the identity
of Gumnaami Baba...

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:07.292
is that of...

01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:13.208
Mr. Shrikant Sharma Kanha.

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.542
Greetings!

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:22.208
So, Mr. Sharma, please tell the Commission
what you know about Gumnaami Baba.

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:26.000
I live in Sitapur.

01:24:27.667 --> 01:24:34.958
I had met Netaji for the first time
in 1938.

01:24:35.167 --> 01:24:37.917
I had even spoken to him.

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:46.542
He was on a tour of UP at that time
as the Congress President.

01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:58.708
After that I met him at Neemsar
in 1963.

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:06.083
He was living there as a monk.

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:12.458
Some people called him Gumnaami Baba.

01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:15.708
Some people called him Bhagwanji.

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:19.625
And some people called him
Bhik Manga Bachha.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:25.458
- I've heard a lot about you...
- Are you a poet?

01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:31.083
Shrikant Sharma Kanha...

01:25:33.042 --> 01:25:36.625
I've heard you're a poet.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.250
Is it true?

01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:42.208
Yes... Yes...

01:25:43.125 --> 01:25:44.875
Yes, Bhagwanji.

01:25:46.458 --> 01:25:52.625
Bhagwanji, your voice sounds very familiar.

01:25:53.917 --> 01:25:59.042
Did you come to Sitapur in 1938?

01:26:00.417 --> 01:26:04.708
Do you know why you can meet me?

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:08.625
No, Bhagwanji.

01:26:08.917 --> 01:26:13.333
Because where sunlight can't reach...

01:26:14.042 --> 01:26:17.500
A poet's verses can.

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:21.083
Thank you.

01:26:21.708 --> 01:26:24.042
- But...
- That's all for today.

01:26:25.333 --> 01:26:27.083
Come back tomorrow.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:31.625
I didn't get to see him that day.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:39.042
But after a few days I had become
his close confidant.

01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:44.875
He had even called me inside his room.

01:26:49.708 --> 01:26:55.625
When I saw him...
When I heard him speak...

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.125
I had no doubt...

01:27:00.542 --> 01:27:05.750
that he was our Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:10.083
Bhagwanji, the country
you won freedom for...

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.917
The people you showed the light to...

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:15.792
Why don't you appear in front of them?

01:27:18.708 --> 01:27:23.500
What you call independence, Kanha...

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:27.125
was just an agreement...

01:27:28.917 --> 01:27:35.333
between a few leaders
and the British Empire.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.458
A disgusting agreement,
the price of which was the Partition.

01:27:47.042 --> 01:27:55.042
I have renounced politics
and the world, anyway.

01:27:56.292 --> 01:28:04.292
And if I, a war criminal
for the Allied powers reveal myself now...

01:28:04.792 --> 01:28:09.625
my country heavily dependent
on Allied powers...

01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:14.208
will suffer a lot of losses.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.458
There's going to be loss, anyway.

01:28:20.458 --> 01:28:23.958
- China has attacked...
- This was not an attack.

01:28:24.542 --> 01:28:27.500
This was just a gentle kick in the back.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.792
It's good for the country.

01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:39.625
At least, the JLN combine will now know
that non-violence can't defend the borders.

01:28:40.417 --> 01:28:45.166
They can write as many patriotic film songs
as they want...

01:28:45.167 --> 01:28:49.250
but we needed weapons
to win this freedom.

01:28:49.583 --> 01:28:53.125
JLN combine... As in?

01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:57.833
My special friend in Delhi.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.667
I get it.

01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:05.042
Can I ask you something?

01:29:07.583 --> 01:29:08.917
Go ahead, son.

01:29:11.833 --> 01:29:14.708
Was there really an accident that day?

01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:20.875
No plane took off that day.

01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:30.625
Much before the crash, your dead man
had already reached his destination.

01:29:34.292 --> 01:29:35.833
Then one day...

01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:44.708
his long time friend and freedom fighter,
Leela Roy...

01:29:45.917 --> 01:29:51.542
came to Neemsar after she heard of him.

01:29:52.708 --> 01:29:57.750
She tried very hard to meet him.

01:29:58.083 --> 01:30:01.375
She sent a lot of things too.

01:30:02.792 --> 01:30:07.958
But Bhagwanji didn't meet her.

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:16.167
And one day she sent a message
through me.

01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:18.625
<i>I've been here since the 23rd.</i>

01:30:18.833 --> 01:30:21.875
<i>But I've been unable to establish
any contact with you.</i>

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.750
<i>If you need to see proof of identity...</i>

01:30:25.917 --> 01:30:28.167
<i>I can arrange for that too.</i>

01:30:28.292 --> 01:30:31.333
<i>I had expected that I will receive orders
to establish contact.</i>

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.667
<i>But I don't know why it hasn't come.</i>

01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:38.250
What did Gandhi say?

01:30:38.708 --> 01:30:40.583
Non-violence is our religion.

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.833
And that's why I'm a violent terrorist.

01:30:42.875 --> 01:30:48.374
Great! That means Kshudiram Bose, Prafulla
Chaki, Binoy, Badal, Dinesh, Bhagat Singh...

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:49.958
All are violent terrorists!

01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.042
And our armed revolution?

01:30:52.292 --> 01:30:57.625
Deepali Sangha, Sree Sangha, Chottograam
armoury raid were all for nothing?

01:30:57.792 --> 01:31:00.541
I've decided to resign Leela, Anil.

01:31:00.542 --> 01:31:02.875
I'll create a new party
called Forward Bloc.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.625
What a relief, Subhas!

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.624
I had asked you
not to make me join Congress.

01:31:08.625 --> 01:31:11.208
I don't belong here.

01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:14.224
You took me from Sree Sangha
and sent me to the Planning Committee.

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:18.375
- Bhagwanji?
- Yes.

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:29.636
Tell Leela Devi and Prof. Samar Guha
that I have received their gift.

01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:40.385
Tell her I loved the sweets
that she made.

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:46.042
I can't meet them.

01:31:46.792 --> 01:31:51.542
But if they want to talk to me then...

01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:58.417
How are you, Lee?

01:32:00.333 --> 01:32:01.500
How are you, Samar?

01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:04.583
Su... Subhas?

01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:09.958
No one called Subhas lives here, Leela.

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:17.208
The one you're talking about
is a completely different person.

01:32:18.083 --> 01:32:20.417
I'm a monk with many names.

01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:28.458
After one becomes a monk, the earlier
life becomes like an earlier birth.

01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:36.417
There's a lot of difference
between that dead man and this body.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.208
You're very angry, Subhas.
Aren't you?

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:44.708
Anger?

01:32:45.667 --> 01:32:49.875
Someone who is an orphan
even though his parents are alive...

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:55.583
Someone who is alone
even though he has siblings...

01:32:56.208 --> 01:33:01.875
Someone who is an refugee
in his own country...

01:33:01.917 --> 01:33:05.917
So much so that he can't even
call his country his own...

01:33:06.667 --> 01:33:11.083
How can he be angry?

01:33:11.625 --> 01:33:15.042
Yes, he might feel hurt.

01:33:18.875 --> 01:33:22.750
You may leave now.
Take care.

01:33:24.042 --> 01:33:26.917
Please write to me often.

01:33:46.917 --> 01:33:50.833
JOYSHREE
FOUNDING EDITOR LEELA ROY

01:33:53.792 --> 01:33:56.000
Thank you, My Lord.

01:33:56.292 --> 01:33:58.500
My name is Sunil Gupta.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.625
I'm a lawyer by profession.

01:34:01.625 --> 01:34:07.917
My family members have been involved
with India's freedom struggle.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:15.333
Dinesh Gupta, from the
Binoy-Badal-Dinesh trio is my brother.

01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:22.082
When Suresh Bose,
Subhas Chandra Bose's brother...

01:34:22.083 --> 01:34:27.167
heard the rumours that Gumnaami Baba
was Netaji...

01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:30.000
he had sent me
to find out the truth.

01:34:30.083 --> 01:34:34.208
Because I knew Netaji very well.

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:38.167
When I came back with the news...

01:34:39.208 --> 01:34:42.374
Suresh, I'm certain.

01:34:42.375 --> 01:34:45.374
I'll not make a mistake
in recognising Subhas.

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:51.792
That voice, politics, religion,
literature, science...

01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:54.417
in-depth knowledge
about different subjects...

01:34:55.708 --> 01:34:59.708
The country, the social system...

01:34:59.833 --> 01:35:04.750
- His anger about the Partition.
- Are you sure?

01:35:06.417 --> 01:35:08.833
He is Subhas?

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.333
He won't come back home?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.125
No, Suresh.
He said it'll be harmful for everyone.

01:35:24.917 --> 01:35:27.500
Many people will be in danger.

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:32.457
He has renounced worldly desires.

01:35:32.458 --> 01:35:35.750
Looked like his pride was hurt.

01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:40.208
Actually, the way India was
supposed to respond at that time...

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:41.917
That didn't happen.

01:35:41.958 --> 01:35:47.000
Yes, we all have let him down.

01:35:48.417 --> 01:35:53.167
Okay... Let him live his own way.

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:56.458
I'll write to him.

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:58.625
Please take the letter to him.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.958
Please arrange for whatever he needs.

01:36:03.333 --> 01:36:11.333
Money, books, magazines,
newspapers, records, anything he needs.

01:36:16.625 --> 01:36:24.625
And on his birthday, take some sweets
and Hilsa fish.

01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:33.583
He really loved it...

01:36:34.542 --> 01:36:35.583
Loves it...

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:42.707
<i>Fields of golden grains,
meadows of fragrant flowers</i>

01:36:42.708 --> 01:36:48.708
<i>This world of ours</i>

01:36:48.792 --> 01:36:54.457
<i>Nestled amongst it is a country</i>

01:36:54.458 --> 01:36:58.749
<i>The greatest country in the world</i>

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:06.750
<i>Created from dreams,
anchored by memories</i>

01:37:09.917 --> 01:37:17.917
<i>Nowhere else will you find
such a glorious country</i>

01:37:21.625 --> 01:37:27.707
<i>She is the queen of all countries</i>

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:35.708
<i>That's my Motherland</i>

01:37:50.708 --> 01:37:55.667
Bhagwanji, why don't you quit smoking?

01:37:56.583 --> 01:37:59.375
What if you fall ill at this age?

01:38:06.917 --> 01:38:10.167
Have you heard of Winston Churchill, Panda?

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:13.750
No, Bhagwanji.
Who was he?

01:38:15.583 --> 01:38:20.708
He was an as... e of the first order.

01:38:21.375 --> 01:38:26.167
He took away all our country's crops
and caused drought...

01:38:26.208 --> 01:38:30.667
that killed 30 lakh Bengalis.

01:38:31.667 --> 01:38:37.167
He was as oppressive as Hitler.

01:38:38.958 --> 01:38:44.792
When I escaped in 1941...

01:38:45.542 --> 01:38:51.875
he issued a shoot-at-sight order for me.

01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:58.750
But they couldn't catch me.

01:38:59.917 --> 01:39:03.042
Did he die of smoking too?

01:39:04.167 --> 01:39:06.000
That's the thing.

01:39:06.667 --> 01:39:10.292
That as... he lived a very long life.

01:39:11.125 --> 01:39:14.458
That too he smoked cigars not cigarettes.

01:39:16.125 --> 01:39:19.333
What health are you talking about, Panda?

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Bhagwanji.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:30.083
Bhagwanji? Bhagwanji? Bhagwanji?

01:39:30.208 --> 01:39:31.208
Saraswati!

01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:33.875
- Banerjee, we need a cylinder!
- I'll get it.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.125
I've asked for a cylinder.
Banerjee is getting it.

01:39:46.167 --> 01:39:51.458
Turn off the lights, Panda.

01:39:54.958 --> 01:40:00.583
I want to sleep now.

01:40:07.708 --> 01:40:14.333
The person whose funeral should have
been attended by 13 lakh people...

01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:18.083
there are just 13 of us here.

01:40:18.458 --> 01:40:21.000
My India is great!

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:27.416
<i>The immense love
of my mother and brothers</i>

01:40:27.417 --> 01:40:33.458
<i>Where else will one find such pure love?</i>

01:40:33.625 --> 01:40:41.625
<i>Let me touch your feet, oh Mother,
in deep adoration</i>

01:40:44.333 --> 01:40:52.333
<i>This is the country of my birth
And I hope to breathe my last here</i>

01:40:57.208 --> 01:41:05.208
<i>Nowhere else will you find
such a glorious country</i>

01:41:09.167 --> 01:41:15.332
<i>She is the queen of all the countries</i>

01:41:15.333 --> 01:41:23.333
<i>That's my Motherland</i>

01:41:36.167 --> 01:41:38.708
<i>Guptar Ghat near Sarayu river...</i>

01:41:39.083 --> 01:41:43.333
<i>where Lord Rama also ended his life
by stepping into the river.</i>

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:47.375
<i>His life ended in a military cantonment
close by.</i>

01:41:48.458 --> 01:41:54.124
<i>Obviously, questions were raised because an ordinary
monk's last rites took place in a military base.</i>

01:41:54.125 --> 01:41:56.582
<i>An ordinary monk?
What are you saying?</i>

01:41:56.583 --> 01:42:01.042
<i>He used to advise the army on big wars
like Vietnam war, Bangladesh war.</i>

01:42:01.083 --> 01:42:02.749
<i>He must have been a great man.</i>

01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:04.542
<i>Liar! Cheat! Fraud!</i>

01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:06.333
<i>See, Mr. Paul...</i>

01:42:06.458 --> 01:42:13.582
<i>Although most civilians wouldn't have access
to military information like he did...</i>

01:42:13.583 --> 01:42:17.749
<i>But I believe, he claimed a lot of things
that were inconsistent...</i>

01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:23.999
<i>unbelievable, exaggerated,
delusional and halucinatory too.</i>

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.082
<i>That might have been the result of the PTSD
he suffered after being tortured in Russia.</i>

01:42:29.083 --> 01:42:33.166
<i>But the question is not about Gumnaami Baba
or his followers' claims.</i>

01:42:33.167 --> 01:42:35.667
<i>The question is about his identity.</i>

01:42:36.042 --> 01:42:38.500
<i>Question is about the
proof of that identity.</i>

01:42:38.667 --> 01:42:40.625
Which I have submitted to the Commission.

01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:44.917
The answer, my friend,
is blowing in the wind.

01:42:45.375 --> 01:42:49.958
The problem is he wasn't an ordinary monk.

01:42:50.667 --> 01:42:56.167
He was an extraordinary soldier.
One of the greatest sons of India.

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:03.542
Is that all, Mr. Dhar?

01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:07.291
- What?
- Or have you found anything else in your research?

01:43:07.292 --> 01:43:09.500
Yes, My Lord.

01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:12.000
I have, My Lord.

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:16.292
The 2760 objects found
in Gumnaami Baba's room.

01:43:16.417 --> 01:43:19.082
Oh, what objects?

01:43:19.083 --> 01:43:23.792
First I'll tell you about
the hundreds of letters we found.

01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:29.667
<i>Pabitra Mohan Roy, Leela Roy, Sunil Das,
Anil Das, Ashutosh Kali, Bishwarup Roy...</i>

01:43:29.708 --> 01:43:31.999
<i>And many more freedom fighters
wrote to him...</i>

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.750
And other well wishers who addressed him
as Netaji and asked him to be careful.

01:43:38.792 --> 01:43:43.625
In a letter to Netaji's dear friend
Dilip Roy, Leela Roy writes...

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:46.292
that Netaji is alive and she has met him.

01:43:46.542 --> 01:43:50.292
But the most surprising thing is...

01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:53.250
<i>A letter signed by Secretary
Nathaniel Knowles...</i>

01:43:53.417 --> 01:43:57.500
An official letter from the
USA's Foreign Services...

01:43:57.792 --> 01:43:59.333
And where was that sent?

01:43:59.542 --> 01:44:04.333
It was sent to an ordinary monk
in Ayodhya.

01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:07.458
Interesting... Anything else?

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.792
Yes, the details of the 2760 objects
have been submitted to the Commission.

01:44:11.958 --> 01:44:15.499
There were some really
interesting objects found.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.042
<i>Japanese water filters.</i>

01:44:18.417 --> 01:44:20.708
Flashlights from World War II.

01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:24.958
<i>German binoculars, pipes,
cigarettes, cigars.</i>

01:44:25.167 --> 01:44:26.792
<i>Bengali, English and Sanskrit...</i>

01:44:27.167 --> 01:44:28.541
Famous books in these languages.

01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:30.500
Numerous journals and magazines.

01:44:30.625 --> 01:44:33.042
Some rare photos of Netaji's parents
and family members.

01:44:33.208 --> 01:44:35.417
<i>Not just that.</i>

01:44:36.083 --> 01:44:40.042
There are notes on the back of the photos
in his own handwriting.

01:44:40.083 --> 01:44:48.083
We've found photos of many of his friends
with the mention of their nicknames.

01:44:48.875 --> 01:44:50.208
But the most important object...

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:56.125
because of which a Government catalogue was
created and the objects kept with care...

01:44:56.208 --> 01:45:00.667
Lolita Bose, Netaji's niece
is the one who found it.

01:45:00.708 --> 01:45:03.875
I knew my uncle very well.

01:45:03.917 --> 01:45:07.667
He appreciated the finer things in life.

01:45:07.708 --> 01:45:12.375
Why would he live like a monk
in a place like this?

01:45:12.417 --> 01:45:14.250
All this is nonsense.

01:45:14.833 --> 01:45:16.917
This is rubbish!

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:50.625
The first paper he found was the Khosla
Commission's original summons to Suresh Bose.

01:45:50.708 --> 01:45:51.333
Remember...

01:45:51.417 --> 01:45:52.792
<i>The original copy.</i>

01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:54.917
But it doesn't end there.

01:45:55.583 --> 01:45:59.958
She also found a copy of
Suresh Bose's dissentient report.

01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:03.916
That Suresh Bose had written
as a member of the Shahnawaz Committee.

01:46:03.917 --> 01:46:07.207
He had logically refuted the report.

01:46:07.208 --> 01:46:09.667
And he had said Subhas is alive.

01:46:10.292 --> 01:46:14.833
The second paper can be tracked down. But
the first one will be difficult to explain.

01:46:16.083 --> 01:46:17.375
No, My Lord.

01:46:18.625 --> 01:46:20.624
If the second document
would have been an ordinary copy...

01:46:20.625 --> 01:46:23.208
it would be easily accessed but...

01:46:24.208 --> 01:46:27.042
But it wasn't an ordinary copy.

01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:34.542
Because that had Lolita Bose's
mother's handwritten message.

01:46:36.792 --> 01:46:38.083
What was the message?

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:42.750
"Dearest brother-in-law...

01:46:42.875 --> 01:46:45.208
May you have a long life.

01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:48.833
Lots of love and blessings."

01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:53.958
Addressed to her beloved brother-in-law.

01:46:54.667 --> 01:46:56.208
Subi!

01:46:57.375 --> 01:47:02.833
Subhas... Subhas Chandra Bose...

01:47:16.792 --> 01:47:18.458
Is that all?

01:47:22.875 --> 01:47:24.417
Yes, My Lord.

01:47:25.375 --> 01:47:26.750
Thank you.

01:47:26.958 --> 01:47:28.917
You may take your seat now.

01:47:35.250 --> 01:47:36.458
Thank you, My Lord.

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:40.500
After six years of
extensive investigation...

01:47:40.708 --> 01:47:45.000
Finally, I've completed collecting
the entire evidence...

01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:47.207
all the testimonies...

01:47:47.208 --> 01:47:50.874
the report and findings
of the previous two commissions.

01:47:50.875 --> 01:47:55.749
I've been to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand,
London and Russia.

01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:59.250
And conducted in-depth queries
with all the witnesses.

01:48:00.208 --> 01:48:05.083
I will duly table the report at
the Parliament in a few months.

01:48:06.375 --> 01:48:10.958
This Commission now
officially comes to an end.

01:48:24.375 --> 01:48:25.542
What is the stress?

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.375
Confirmed, tomorrow?

01:48:27.917 --> 01:48:29.458
Yeah, that's what I heard.

01:48:30.583 --> 01:48:32.458
Does Sumit have any information?

01:48:32.625 --> 01:48:34.042
No.

01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:35.958
But most probably, it's tomorrow.

01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.375
Expect the worst, Chandrachur.

01:48:38.667 --> 01:48:41.417
You know how it went
with Shahnawaz and Khosla.

01:48:41.958 --> 01:48:43.624
Adheer is right.

01:48:43.625 --> 01:48:45.583
People will shout and scream.

01:48:45.708 --> 01:48:47.917
It'll fizzle out in Delhi.

01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:51.375
But they're under a lot of pressure...

01:48:52.458 --> 01:48:55.917
Anuj, get the door please.

01:48:56.875 --> 01:49:00.250
I raised some fundamental points.

01:49:02.083 --> 01:49:04.625
- But now if they... What?
- Hey!

01:49:05.208 --> 01:49:07.333
Your wife...

01:49:10.375 --> 01:49:12.292
Am I disturbing you?

01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:13.708
No, not at all.

01:49:13.833 --> 01:49:15.042
Come in.

01:49:15.083 --> 01:49:20.792
I thought it is a big day for all of you,
so will come and wish you all the best.

01:49:20.833 --> 01:49:23.250
Thank you. Thank you.
How did you know?

01:49:23.625 --> 01:49:25.813
Newspaper, TV... It's everywhere.

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.542
Well...

01:49:28.333 --> 01:49:29.625
- We'll get going now.
- What?

01:49:29.667 --> 01:49:31.374
No, I'll push off.
You guys stay please...

01:49:31.375 --> 01:49:35.792
- No, no...
- Please stay.

01:49:35.917 --> 01:49:38.542
- See you tomorrow in the morning.
- We'll leave.

01:49:38.583 --> 01:49:39.707
- Okay...
- Let's go.

01:49:39.708 --> 01:49:42.332
- Okay, good night.
- Bye.

01:49:42.333 --> 01:49:45.583
- What are you staring at?
- Hey, pass me my bag.

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:48.582
- Anuj, call me in the morning.
- Okay.

01:49:48.583 --> 01:49:50.833
Adheer, take the print outs.

01:49:51.875 --> 01:49:53.083
But that's my shoe.

01:50:09.083 --> 01:50:11.167
Can I get you a drink?

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.542
Okay.

01:50:12.667 --> 01:50:13.667
What do you want?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.167
- The usual. Rum and Coke.
- Okay.

01:50:20.875 --> 01:50:25.250
You know, of the people
who knew Gumnaami Baba...

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.999
one of them was Colonel VR Mohan.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.582
The owner of the famous
Mohan Meakin Breweries.

01:50:30.583 --> 01:50:34.333
He wrote some letters to Baba
in the '50s.

01:50:34.792 --> 01:50:40.083
Later on, he named the best selling product
of his company after Gumnaami Baba.

01:50:40.583 --> 01:50:42.000
Which one?

01:50:43.917 --> 01:50:45.042
This...

01:50:45.958 --> 01:50:47.333
Old Monk.

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:50.500
Great trivia!

01:50:50.542 --> 01:50:52.833
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:50:55.458 --> 01:50:58.667
- It's too stiff.
- Here's some water.

01:51:06.583 --> 01:51:08.250
Are you okay?

01:51:08.958 --> 01:51:10.625
Are you okay?

01:51:12.458 --> 01:51:19.125
All of life's struggles and fights
culminates to just one night.

01:51:21.792 --> 01:51:23.083
I see.

01:51:24.917 --> 01:51:26.375
Are you very tense?

01:51:27.083 --> 01:51:30.042
Not like the board exams but yes.

01:51:35.125 --> 01:51:38.375
So, the thing is...

01:51:40.292 --> 01:51:45.083
Can I stay over tonight?

01:51:46.292 --> 01:51:47.292
What?

01:51:52.917 --> 01:51:56.792
How does a marriage become better
after divorce?

01:52:58.917 --> 01:53:00.750
Chandrachur.

01:53:05.083 --> 01:53:06.292
Who are you?

01:53:06.917 --> 01:53:11.375
Can't you recognise the person
you've been researching?

01:53:13.292 --> 01:53:14.583
Oh!

01:53:15.042 --> 01:53:18.292
- You are...
- Yes, you're right...

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:22.375
What's happening?
You're dead.

01:53:24.333 --> 01:53:26.458
I am dead.

01:53:27.083 --> 01:53:32.542
But not because my heart stopped beating
or my body was cremated.

01:53:37.833 --> 01:53:38.833
Then?

01:53:40.792 --> 01:53:44.750
A soldier doesn't die
when he becomes a martyr.

01:53:44.792 --> 01:53:48.083
He dies when people forget him.

01:53:48.292 --> 01:53:56.124
A monk dies when people call out his name
for the last time.

01:53:56.125 --> 01:53:58.499
Then there's no death for you, sir.

01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:03.541
People still remember you...
Especially as Netaji, very well.

01:54:03.542 --> 01:54:09.500
Oh, Netaji is at the airport
and at a busy intersection on horseback!

01:54:09.792 --> 01:54:11.750
You call that remembering?

01:54:14.833 --> 01:54:16.124
No, sir.

01:54:16.125 --> 01:54:21.916
As long as I'm here, we are here,
Mission Netaji is here...

01:54:21.917 --> 01:54:22.958
I know.

01:54:23.625 --> 01:54:26.083
That's why, I have some advice
about tomorrow.

01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:30.166
Don't worry about the result.

01:54:30.167 --> 01:54:37.792
No matter what the results are tomorrow,
keep up your work.

01:54:39.417 --> 01:54:41.333
What's going to happen tomorrow?

01:54:43.875 --> 01:54:45.208
I don't know.

01:54:47.708 --> 01:54:49.458
Only Time knows.

01:54:49.667 --> 01:54:52.417
But you yourself are Time!

01:54:53.500 --> 01:55:01.500
You used to sign your name as Mahakaal
meaning Time in your letters.

01:55:08.917 --> 01:55:11.458
Bhagwanji!

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:17.042
Bhagwanji!

01:55:19.833 --> 01:55:21.792
Come, come.

01:55:21.833 --> 01:55:23.000
Has anything come out?

01:55:23.042 --> 01:55:26.208
- Plane crash theory has been rejected.
- Good!

01:55:26.292 --> 01:55:28.833
- What else?
- Yes, telling you.

01:55:29.333 --> 01:55:31.082
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:55:31.083 --> 01:55:33.167
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:34.583
Morning!

01:55:34.833 --> 01:55:36.500
Okay, listen to this.

01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:42.332
"On a conspectus of all the facts and
circumstances relevant to the above issues...

01:55:42.333 --> 01:55:47.750
it stands established
that emplaning at Saigon on 17.8.1945...

01:55:47.792 --> 01:55:51.124
Netaji succeeded in evading
the Allied forces...

01:55:51.125 --> 01:55:53.166
and escaping out of their reach.

01:55:53.167 --> 01:55:58.082
And as a camouflage thereof the entire
make believe story of the air crash...

01:55:58.083 --> 01:56:03.749
Netaji's death therein and his cremation was
engineered by the Japanese army authorities...

01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:07.291
including the two doctors
and Habibur Rehman.

01:56:07.292 --> 01:56:13.167
And then aired on 23.8.1945
through a statement prepared by SA Ayer...

01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:15.874
at the dictation of the aforementioned
authorities...

01:56:15.875 --> 01:56:20.041
to give imprimatur of INA
to the death news of Netaji."

01:56:20.042 --> 01:56:22.083
Yes! Yes!

01:56:22.167 --> 01:56:23.582
What about the ashes
in the Renkoji Temple?

01:56:23.583 --> 01:56:24.874
Yeah...

01:56:24.875 --> 01:56:27.917
"Since ashes collected
were Ichiro Okura's...

01:56:27.958 --> 01:56:29.207
not of Netaji...

01:56:29.208 --> 01:56:33.125
the only inference drawn is that the ashes
lying in the temple is not that of Netaji."

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.082
What have they said about Russia?

01:56:36.083 --> 01:56:37.792
Russia... yeah.

01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:43.583
"But the question whether Netaji
thereafter landed in Russia or elsewhere...

01:56:43.667 --> 01:56:47.583
cannot be answered due
to dearth of evidence."

01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:52.249
Even I thought this might happen.
Anyway, let it be.

01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:54.625
And Gumnaami Baba?

01:56:55.583 --> 01:56:57.042
You read it out.

01:56:57.333 --> 01:57:00.708
- Someone read it out.
- Read...

01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:11.124
"Apparently, there's no reason for not
acting or relying upon the evidence...

01:57:11.125 --> 01:57:12.957
of the last two categories
of witnesses.

01:57:12.958 --> 01:57:16.917
Particularly of the category
who had seen Netaji before 1945...

01:57:17.167 --> 01:57:22.624
and also met Bhagwanji/Gumnaami Baba
face to face on a number of occasions.

01:57:22.625 --> 01:57:26.457
More so in their evidence regarding the
frequent visit of some freedom fighters...

01:57:26.458 --> 01:57:31.749
eminent politicians and former members of INA on
January 23rd and during the Durga festival..."

01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:34.167
- So? So? So? Then what?
- But as...

01:57:34.875 --> 01:57:36.500
Why apparently?

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.874
"But as the discussion will follow there are
other formidable facts and circumstances..."

01:57:40.875 --> 01:57:45.042
What facts and circumstances?
Tell me in short.

01:57:53.125 --> 01:57:55.749
"In fine, the absence
of any clinching evidence...

01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:58.624
to prove that
Bhagwanji/Gumnaami Baba was Netaji.

01:57:58.625 --> 01:58:04.792
The question whether he died in Faizabad
on 16.9.1985 need not be answered."

01:58:07.125 --> 01:58:09.417
They don't need to answer questions
about Netaji?

01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:12.417
Is this a joke?

01:58:12.458 --> 01:58:15.582
Are we talking about the grocer
or the local laundry guy?

01:58:15.583 --> 01:58:18.957
They said they can't come to any conclusions
after the handwriting analysis.

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:19.958
What?

01:58:21.167 --> 01:58:23.208
This is outrageous!

01:58:23.292 --> 01:58:26.667
Mr. B Lal, India's best
handwriting expert...

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:29.332
The ex-Government Officer
of Examined Documents Department...

01:58:29.333 --> 01:58:32.791
How can they say this after a 200-page
detailed document by him?

01:58:32.792 --> 01:58:35.291
He was sent both English
and Bengali handwritings.

01:58:35.292 --> 01:58:38.249
He checked both
and said Netaji and Gumnaami...

01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:41.542
Okay, forget B. Lal.
What about Curt Baggett?

01:58:41.583 --> 01:58:47.542
FBI's very own American handwriting expert.
40 years of experience. 5000 cases.

01:58:47.583 --> 01:58:49.666
We sent him both the handwritings
without revealing the identities.

01:58:49.667 --> 01:58:51.374
He said it's the same person.

01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:55.207
He's even ready to testify
in any court of Law.

01:58:55.208 --> 01:58:56.707
I don't know what's going on.

01:58:56.708 --> 01:58:59.999
ML Sharma and Amar Singh
of the Department of Examined Documents...

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.207
And SK Mondal of Kolkata's Forensic Lab
had given negative reports.

01:59:04.208 --> 01:59:05.791
After all, they are Government officials.

01:59:05.792 --> 01:59:07.499
Rubbish! ML Sharma?

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.666
It was a brief one line report.

01:59:09.667 --> 01:59:12.708
There were no supporting causes
or analysis.

01:59:12.958 --> 01:59:15.375
They don't care.
They don't.

01:59:16.125 --> 01:59:18.041
Anuj, what are they saying
about the DNA test?

01:59:18.042 --> 01:59:23.332
They found some teeth
in Gumnaami Baba's house.

01:59:23.333 --> 01:59:26.750
It didn't match Netaji's DNA.

01:59:27.458 --> 01:59:31.291
In fact, Hyderabad couldn't give
any answers.

01:59:31.292 --> 01:59:33.375
And Kolkata said it didn't match.

01:59:33.417 --> 01:59:38.500
And the Kolkata Lab didn't give the
machine-generated report they usually do.

01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:41.000
Only human interpretation
of the test.

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.750
How can they do this?

01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:47.124
Forget everything else and tell me...

01:59:47.125 --> 01:59:51.375
How will they prove
that those teeth belong to Gumnaami Baba?

01:59:51.583 --> 01:59:54.999
That's why there's no mention of the teeth
or the DNA test...

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.791
in the verdict about Gumnaami Baba
from the Allahabad Court.

01:59:57.792 --> 02:00:00.000
Even if the teeth belongs to him...

02:00:00.042 --> 02:00:02.041
I've heard they've faked the DNA test too.

02:00:02.042 --> 02:00:04.166
There's nothing to be surprised about.

02:00:04.167 --> 02:00:08.208
These politically sensitive tests should be
carried out in labs in first world countries.

02:00:08.667 --> 02:00:12.083
We must see this DNA test through.

02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:14.792
Anyway... Anyway...

02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:22.166
At least, the Government has to agree that
the 60-year-old plane crash theory is wrong.

02:00:22.167 --> 02:00:23.374
A lie!

02:00:23.375 --> 02:00:26.666
It's victory for us!
Let's celebrate!

02:00:26.667 --> 02:00:30.042
Anuj, get the bottle of rum.
Let's drink!

02:00:30.375 --> 02:00:32.167
Where's the water?

02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:37.958
What's wrong?

02:00:41.375 --> 02:00:43.083
What is it?

02:00:45.292 --> 02:00:47.625
Why are you all so quiet?

02:00:48.167 --> 02:00:49.500
Huh?

02:00:50.292 --> 02:00:52.958
Why so serious?

02:00:53.250 --> 02:00:54.750
Adheer?

02:00:57.292 --> 02:00:58.708
What is it, Anuj?

02:01:05.375 --> 02:01:07.167
Today...

02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:12.833
The Goverment responded immediately after
this report was tabled at the Parliament.

02:01:13.292 --> 02:01:14.625
Which is?

02:01:15.833 --> 02:01:18.000
Which is... I mean...

02:01:20.083 --> 02:01:24.542
The Government doesn't...
I mean this Commission...

02:01:25.083 --> 02:01:27.875
They don't agree with the report.

02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:33.625
And this report along
with all the research...

02:01:34.542 --> 02:01:38.583
has completely been dismissed
by the Government.

02:01:41.625 --> 02:01:42.958
Why?

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.291
What's the reason?

02:01:44.292 --> 02:01:47.207
They have not given any reasons...

02:01:47.208 --> 02:01:49.250
Just like that.

02:01:51.417 --> 02:01:53.167
Just like that?

02:01:53.292 --> 02:01:55.333
Yes, just like that.

02:01:56.708 --> 02:02:02.500
The most thorough, intensive
and extensive commission...

02:02:03.875 --> 02:02:10.791
After spending tax payer's money
on the investigation for six years...

02:02:10.792 --> 02:02:12.917
Just like that?

02:02:28.208 --> 02:02:31.583
How can the Government...

02:02:32.083 --> 02:02:39.666
reject their own Commission led
by the Chief Justice of a High Court?

02:02:39.667 --> 02:02:41.582
Just like that?

02:02:41.583 --> 02:02:43.000
Just like that.

02:02:43.333 --> 02:02:48.708
How can this happen in a democratic space?

02:03:00.083 --> 02:03:01.292
Hello?

02:03:01.375 --> 02:03:03.291
<i>Listen to me carefully, okay?</i>

02:03:03.292 --> 02:03:07.958
<i>Stop this circus called Mission Netaji
that you're running.</i>

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.082
<i>Take the Commission's report in your hand.</i>

02:03:12.083 --> 02:03:12.792
Listen.

02:03:12.793 --> 02:03:14.041
<i>Now go to the loo.</i>

02:03:14.042 --> 02:03:17.374
<i>Sit on the commode and
s... t out your research.</i>

02:03:17.375 --> 02:03:20.999
<i>Now, wipe your a... with it
and throw it away.</i>

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.791
<i>Otherwise you won't be in a state
to use the commode ever again.</i>

02:03:25.792 --> 02:03:27.542
Hello? Hello? Hello?

02:03:27.667 --> 02:03:30.082
What's your name?
Who are you?

02:03:30.083 --> 02:03:34.125
<i>Doesn't matter who I am.
Just remember you're a journalist.</i>

02:03:34.667 --> 02:03:37.208
<i>Don't try to be a detective
or a patriot.</i>

02:03:37.458 --> 02:03:42.249
<i>Write about Bollywood and cricket.
You can write about election too.</i>

02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:46.167
<i>But stay away from Netaji. Okay?
Long live, India!</i>

02:03:46.208 --> 02:03:50.750
Hello? Tell me your bloody name!
Hello!

02:03:51.375 --> 02:03:53.500
Bloody swine!

02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:05.292
I need some time alone, please.

02:04:24.542 --> 02:04:25.917
What happened?

02:04:27.583 --> 02:04:30.167
What does the report say?

02:04:33.708 --> 02:04:36.000
What happened?

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.000
Hey...

02:04:57.708 --> 02:04:59.667
Why are you locking the door?

02:05:02.167 --> 02:05:04.374
Why did you lock the door?

02:05:04.375 --> 02:05:07.375
Get out of there.
Hello?

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:10.250
What are you doing?

02:05:15.375 --> 02:05:19.667
Hello? Hello?
What's going on?

02:05:20.042 --> 02:05:21.792
What are you doing there?

02:05:22.292 --> 02:05:24.125
Hey, Chandra!

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:28.208
What the hell are you doing, Chandra?
Open the door.

02:05:28.875 --> 02:05:31.417
Have you gone crazy?

02:05:32.875 --> 02:05:35.750
Chandra... Chandra! Open...

02:05:37.917 --> 02:05:42.833
Hello? Hello? Where are you?
Chandra has lost it.

02:05:42.917 --> 02:05:45.874
He's burning the house down.
Please come back quickly!

02:05:45.875 --> 02:05:47.667
I can't...

02:05:48.375 --> 02:05:53.083
Chandra, please open the door!
Chandra, are you mad or what?

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.458
Have you gone mad?

02:05:58.250 --> 02:06:00.542
Chandra? Chandra...

02:06:01.708 --> 02:06:03.958
Chandra, what are you doing?

02:06:06.333 --> 02:06:08.167
Hello? Fire Brigade?

02:06:09.083 --> 02:06:10.625
Please note the address.

02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:15.167
It's 3/7 Aurobindo Nagar,
Kolkata 40. Yes, 40!

02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:23.708
What are you doing?

02:06:23.875 --> 02:06:26.833
Have you lost your mind? Hello?
Chandra...

02:06:28.833 --> 02:06:30.332
Open the door.

02:06:30.333 --> 02:06:33.167
Honey, please listen to me.

02:06:34.125 --> 02:06:37.000
Chandra, open the door.

02:06:39.708 --> 02:06:40.958
Chandra.

02:06:44.458 --> 02:06:47.167
Chandra, open the door.

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:59.041
Chandra, open the door.

02:06:59.042 --> 02:07:04.125
Chandra, what the hell are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

02:07:04.333 --> 02:07:07.416
Stop acting crazy.

02:07:07.417 --> 02:07:10.042
Chandra, open the door.
What's wrong with you?

02:07:15.875 --> 02:07:18.125
Chandra, open the door.

02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:23.708
Please get him out of there.

02:07:25.667 --> 02:07:28.583
Get the hammer!
And some water!

02:07:28.875 --> 02:07:30.167
It's round the corner.

02:07:36.458 --> 02:07:37.750
Break it down.

02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:44.708
(indistinct chatter)

02:08:32.167 --> 02:08:33.499
- Sit here.
- Right here.

02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:35.208
- Get him water.
- Go that side...

02:08:35.292 --> 02:08:37.542
- I'll get the water.
- Give him some air.

02:08:37.958 --> 02:08:39.958
- Hey.
- The fire!

02:08:43.792 --> 02:08:45.791
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

02:08:45.792 --> 02:08:48.875
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.332
What were you trying to do?

02:08:54.333 --> 02:08:56.458
Are you a follower of Netaji?

02:08:56.542 --> 02:08:59.124
Netaji's disciple? Netaji's fan?

02:08:59.125 --> 02:09:00.457
What were you doing?

02:09:00.458 --> 02:09:03.374
Are you already giving up?

02:09:03.375 --> 02:09:08.707
- Three years of work, Roni...
- Yeah, so?

02:09:08.708 --> 02:09:12.249
- Three years of fights and struggles...
- Only three years!

02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:15.833
Do you know how long that man fought for
the one you're fighting for?

02:09:15.875 --> 02:09:19.666
Thirty years!
Who are you fighting against?

02:09:19.667 --> 02:09:24.708
Democracy. Bureaucracy. But he fought
against the entire British Empire.

02:09:24.833 --> 02:09:30.291
What's wrong with you?

02:09:30.292 --> 02:09:33.667
I can't do it!
I am not Subhas!

02:09:33.917 --> 02:09:37.333
I am not Subhas!
I can't do it.

02:09:39.625 --> 02:09:43.291
You can do it! You're Subhas!
We are all Subhas!

02:09:43.292 --> 02:09:45.125
There's a little bit of Subhas
in all of us.

02:09:45.167 --> 02:09:47.249
One who protests
after living in fear for years.

02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:52.666
One who fights against the bribery
of non-violence and untruths.

02:09:52.667 --> 02:09:55.207
If not you, then who?

02:09:55.208 --> 02:09:58.249
Get up! Stand up!

02:09:58.250 --> 02:10:00.916
What are you doing?

02:10:00.917 --> 02:10:03.167
We have to get a DNA test done.

02:10:03.708 --> 02:10:05.208
A DNA test...

02:10:05.375 --> 02:10:08.167
In a first world lab...
A proper DNA test...

02:10:08.458 --> 02:10:12.333
- One minute...
- DNA test...

02:10:13.292 --> 02:10:18.499
I have a very close friend
who stays in New York.

02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:20.291
And he's a scientist.

02:10:20.292 --> 02:10:24.125
He has a lot of contacts.

02:10:24.292 --> 02:10:27.249
We'll figure something out.

02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:33.249
Meanwhile, is there anything else
we can do?

02:10:33.250 --> 02:10:35.249
A law has been passed.

02:10:35.250 --> 02:10:37.542
Right To Information Act.

02:10:37.708 --> 02:10:39.708
Maybe we can fight based on that.

02:10:39.792 --> 02:10:44.500
Some day the Government
might declassify the files on Netaji.

02:10:45.042 --> 02:10:47.749
But only if we pressurize them enough...

02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:50.499
Then do that... pressurize them...

02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:55.625
Then why aren't you doing it?
We will pressurize them.

02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:07.083
Thank you, comrade!

02:11:07.333 --> 02:11:08.625
That'll be all, gentlemen.

02:11:09.208 --> 02:11:10.500
Long live, India!

02:11:12.375 --> 02:11:13.667
Long live, India!

02:11:15.292 --> 02:11:16.292
Long live, India!

02:11:42.667 --> 02:11:48.375
<i>Let peace and prosperity shower on us</i>

02:11:48.417 --> 02:11:52.875
<i>India's destiny has awakened</i>

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:59.082
<i>Punjab, Sind, Gujarat, Maratha</i>

02:11:59.083 --> 02:12:03.875
<i>Dravid, Utkal, Banga</i>

02:12:04.417 --> 02:12:12.417
<i>The deep oceans and the Himalaya
And the beautiful Yamuna and Ganga</i>

02:12:14.917 --> 02:12:19.875
<i>We sing praises of you</i>

02:12:20.375 --> 02:12:25.208
<i>You are the one who gives us life</i>

02:12:25.375 --> 02:12:30.625
<i>You give us all hope</i>

02:12:30.958 --> 02:12:36.417
<i>You shine on the world like the Sun</i>

02:12:36.458 --> 02:12:40.833
<i>India shines bright</i>

02:12:40.958 --> 02:12:48.958
<i>Glory to thee</i>

02:12:54.875 --> 02:13:00.583
<i>India shines bright</i>

02:13:00.833 --> 02:13:06.707
<i>Forget the man you have heard about.
He's a ghost now.</i>

02:13:06.708 --> 02:13:11.666
<i>You'll be making a mistake
if you judge me against the same yardstick.</i>

02:13:11.667 --> 02:13:13.417
<i>That man is no more.</i>

02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:16.916
<i>He has changed inside and out.</i>

02:13:16.917 --> 02:13:21.666
<i>Inert, static
and out of everyone's reach.</i>

02:13:21.667 --> 02:13:29.667
<i>Birds sing your praises every morning</i>

02:13:32.375 --> 02:13:40.375
<i>A fragrant breeze brings
in a new lease of life</i>
