WEBVTT

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:58.136
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.264
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice age?

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.058
Because of all the ice.

00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:09.021
Well, things just got a little chillier.

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:12.692
Help. Help.

00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:16.112
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:18.489
But, but, but, Dad.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.367
No buts. You can play extinction later.

00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:25.121
OK. Come on, guys.

00:04:25.413 --> 00:04:27.457
So, where's Eddie?

00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:31.335
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:33.504
Really?

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.716
I'm flying.

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.136
Some breakthrough.

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:43.806
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.893
Crazy mammoth.

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:58.404
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:03.034
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

00:05:03.242 --> 00:05:06.829
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

00:05:08.664 --> 00:05:11.375
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:13.711
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:17.840
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:29.977
I'm up. I'm up.

00:05:32.438 --> 00:05:37.735
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.571
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:47.411
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:54.377
They left without me.
They do this every year.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.382
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:04.137
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:08.975
All right, I'll just go by myself.

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:13.229
Sick.

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:16.065
Wide body, kerb it next time.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.651
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:24.532
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

00:06:24.657 --> 00:06:27.785
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.456
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:36.711
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:41.549
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

00:06:41.674 --> 00:06:45.428
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

00:06:45.553 --> 00:06:50.516
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:52.643
Yummo.

00:06:52.894 --> 00:06:55.813
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:01.277
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

00:07:01.402 --> 00:07:03.446
He ruined our salad.

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:07.617
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:11.996
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:15.750
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:22.131
Delicious. That's good eating.

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:25.760
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.638
<i>Tasty, isn't it? Bon appêtit.</i>

00:07:30.014 --> 00:07:32.141
Now?

00:07:32.642 --> 00:07:34.685
Now.

00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:47.615
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.995
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.415
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.293
<i>We'll just take our furry piñata and go.</i>

00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:02.380
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:04.882
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:08.344
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:11.556
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

00:08:11.722 --> 00:08:13.766
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:17.520
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:20.523
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:24.026
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:29.407
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:33.369
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

00:08:37.623 --> 00:08:41.169
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

00:08:42.378 --> 00:08:44.088
Get him.

00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:22.210
A dandelion?

00:09:25.087 --> 00:09:27.131
We did it.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.393
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:44.690
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:47.276
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:49.403
- Wow, really?
- No.

00:09:49.695 --> 00:09:53.991
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:56.828
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:59.831
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:04.585
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:09.132
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

00:10:09.257 --> 00:10:13.803
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:17.723
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:20.143
You're a very shrewd mammal.

00:10:20.268 --> 00:10:23.187
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:25.314
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.611
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

00:10:33.156 --> 00:10:35.199
Stop following me.

00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:42.707
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

00:11:26.793 --> 00:11:30.713
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

00:11:33.132 --> 00:11:38.513
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breaktast?
- It wouldn't be breaktast without him.

00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:44.393
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:47.605
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.275
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabres.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.529
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

00:11:55.613 --> 00:12:00.201
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

00:12:00.326 --> 00:12:05.581
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:29.147
Phew. I'm wiped out.

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:33.151
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

00:12:33.276 --> 00:12:36.028
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

00:12:36.154 --> 00:12:42.493
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

00:12:42.952 --> 00:12:44.704
Fascinating.

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:49.125
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

00:12:55.173 --> 00:12:57.341
Think I saw a spark.

00:13:01.304 --> 00:13:04.891
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:07.518
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

00:13:07.643 --> 00:13:11.147
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

00:13:11.564 --> 00:13:16.235
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.946
You should see what they did last year.

00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:21.783
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:24.660
and they gagged me with a fieldmouse,

00:13:24.786 --> 00:13:28.372
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

00:13:28.498 --> 00:13:31.292
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.174
So what about you? You have family?

00:13:42.428 --> 00:13:45.556
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:51.646
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.817
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

00:13:55.942 --> 00:13:57.985
Manny.

00:16:48.865 --> 00:16:50.992
There's Diego. Fall back.

00:16:57.582 --> 00:17:00.418
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

00:17:00.668 --> 00:17:03.171
You lost it?

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.634
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:12.388
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:15.850
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

00:17:17.268 --> 00:17:19.312
It had better be alive.

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:23.107
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

00:17:23.232 --> 00:17:25.693
Let's go.

00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:52.470
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance,

00:17:52.595 --> 00:17:55.139
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt. "

00:17:55.348 --> 00:17:58.726
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me. "

00:17:58.851 --> 00:18:02.563
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:05.942
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:08.277
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

00:18:09.821 --> 00:18:11.906
Manny?

00:18:12.532 --> 00:18:14.575
Manny?

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.922
Look at that. He's OK.

00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:24.896
She's gone.

00:19:34.697 --> 00:19:38.075
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

00:19:38.242 --> 00:19:42.246
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:44.832
But you can't leave him here.

00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:52.381
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

00:19:52.673 --> 00:19:56.594
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

00:19:56.719 --> 00:20:02.308
There never was a "we". In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".

00:20:03.267 --> 00:20:10.108
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:15.279
- Fine, be ajerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

00:20:15.363 --> 00:20:18.783
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

00:20:18.908 --> 00:20:23.162
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

00:20:23.287 --> 00:20:25.373
No, we don't.

00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:58.197
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

00:20:58.823 --> 00:21:02.034
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.203
I'm gonna die.

00:21:17.633 --> 00:21:19.135
Manny.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.819
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

00:21:39.906 --> 00:21:43.284
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:45.161
There is no "us".

00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:48.581
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

00:21:48.706 --> 00:21:51.793
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

00:21:52.001 --> 00:21:55.463
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

00:21:55.588 --> 00:21:57.632
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

00:21:57.757 --> 00:21:59.801
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

00:21:59.884 --> 00:22:01.969
You were thinkin' it.

00:22:02.094 --> 00:22:04.722
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

00:22:05.306 --> 00:22:08.893
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

00:22:09.143 --> 00:22:16.234
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the
humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.

00:22:16.317 --> 00:22:19.487
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.616
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:27.286
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

00:22:27.411 --> 00:22:31.707
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:35.920
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

00:22:36.003 --> 00:22:39.924
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:46.430
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.

00:22:46.556 --> 00:22:49.684
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:52.270
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:22:52.395 --> 00:22:54.480
Don't spear me.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.653
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

00:23:01.737 --> 00:23:04.282
That's perfect.

00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:36.939
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

00:23:37.064 --> 00:23:39.734
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

00:23:39.859 --> 00:23:43.654
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.115
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

00:23:46.282 --> 00:23:50.077
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

00:23:50.203 --> 00:23:52.413
You didn't miss them by much.

00:23:52.538 --> 00:23:55.917
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

00:23:56.334 --> 00:24:00.463
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.510
You don't need this aggravation.

00:24:06.469 --> 00:24:10.264
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

00:24:10.389 --> 00:24:13.059
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

00:24:13.184 --> 00:24:16.687
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

00:24:16.813 --> 00:24:20.358
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:26.280
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

00:24:26.447 --> 00:24:29.450
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

00:24:29.575 --> 00:24:35.373
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

00:24:42.088 --> 00:24:46.342
Here's your little bundle ofjoy.
We're returning it to the humans.

00:24:46.467 --> 00:24:51.973
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

00:24:52.098 --> 00:24:54.892
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:01.149
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:06.028
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

00:25:06.154 --> 00:25:08.614
and the baby, too.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.410
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

00:25:12.493 --> 00:25:18.082
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

00:25:18.207 --> 00:25:21.961
Über-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:23.629
Help me.

00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:43.065
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

00:25:43.274 --> 00:25:47.361
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

00:25:47.487 --> 00:25:49.572
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

00:25:49.697 --> 00:25:52.241
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "

00:25:52.575 --> 00:25:55.787
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

00:25:55.912 --> 00:25:58.873
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

00:25:58.998 --> 00:26:01.417
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:04.295
So if he poops, where does it go?

00:26:06.714 --> 00:26:10.676
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:14.013
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

00:26:14.138 --> 00:26:17.558
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

00:26:17.683 --> 00:26:20.144
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.946
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:32.907
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

00:26:33.032 --> 00:26:35.743
I'm gonna slip.

00:26:39.205 --> 00:26:41.457
It's clean. Got ya!

00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:45.753
Will you cut it out?

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.466
Do that again. He likes it.

00:26:52.593 --> 00:26:55.721
It's makin' me feel better too.

00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:57.974
Here, you hold it.

00:27:04.564 --> 00:27:06.274
Turn him towards me.

00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:08.776
Where is the baby?

00:27:09.819 --> 00:27:12.029
There he is.

00:27:12.155 --> 00:27:14.949
Where is the baby?

00:27:15.491 --> 00:27:18.661
There he is.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.289
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.879
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

00:27:28.004 --> 00:27:31.007
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

00:27:31.132 --> 00:27:33.718
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

00:27:33.843 --> 00:27:36.554
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:40.183
Enough, enough, enough.

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.770
Food.

00:27:52.987 --> 00:27:54.655
I don't know, but I've been told

00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:56.866
I don't know, but I've been told

00:27:56.991 --> 00:28:01.120
End of the world be mighty cold

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:04.040
Prepare for the Ice age!

00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:06.626
Protect the dodo way of life!

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:11.005
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

00:28:12.131 --> 00:28:14.717
Protect the dodo way of life!

00:28:14.842 --> 00:28:17.053
Prepare for the Ice age!

00:28:17.178 --> 00:28:20.139
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.603
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

00:28:25.728 --> 00:28:29.732
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

00:28:31.526 --> 00:28:33.402
<i>.. burn and die.</i>

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.698
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

00:28:37.824 --> 00:28:41.077
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

00:28:41.285 --> 00:28:45.331
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

00:28:45.456 --> 00:28:47.500
So you got three melons?

00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:53.047
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

00:28:53.172 --> 00:28:56.843
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

00:28:56.968 --> 00:28:59.720
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

00:28:59.846 --> 00:29:02.098
Oh, no. No.

00:29:02.515 --> 00:29:06.102
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.367
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.455
There goes our last female.

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:36.507
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

00:29:37.508 --> 00:29:39.969
The last melon.

00:31:06.722 --> 00:31:09.767
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

00:31:13.146 --> 00:31:17.108
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:20.862
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

00:31:26.826 --> 00:31:30.830
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:36.752
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

00:31:40.423 --> 00:31:42.467
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

00:31:51.642 --> 00:31:53.686
Bedtime, squirt.

00:32:03.404 --> 00:32:05.281
The triumphant return.

00:32:05.406 --> 00:32:08.242
Huh? Oh, that.

00:32:09.368 --> 00:32:13.706
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:17.543
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:20.546
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:30.014
All right, good night.

00:32:52.578 --> 00:32:54.705
Will you stop it?

00:32:55.081 --> 00:32:57.834
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:05.591
Oy.

00:33:53.806 --> 00:33:57.101
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

00:33:57.226 --> 00:34:00.813
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:03.941
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

00:34:04.066 --> 00:34:08.112
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

00:34:08.237 --> 00:34:13.493
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all. "

00:34:15.077 --> 00:34:17.371
I have a message for Soto.

00:34:17.497 --> 00:34:19.957
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

00:34:21.209 --> 00:34:23.419
And tell him I'm bringing...

00:34:24.045 --> 00:34:26.088
a mammoth.

00:34:26.214 --> 00:34:28.883
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

00:34:29.509 --> 00:34:33.054
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.849
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:41.187
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:43.356
Get everyone ready.

00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:46.109
Now.

00:35:09.298 --> 00:35:12.426
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

00:35:14.053 --> 00:35:15.221
Sid.

00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:19.809
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

00:35:19.934 --> 00:35:23.771
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

00:35:24.063 --> 00:35:27.900
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

00:35:28.067 --> 00:35:30.236
Sabres were closing in on him.

00:35:30.361 --> 00:35:33.322
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

00:35:33.448 --> 00:35:38.202
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

00:35:38.327 --> 00:35:42.457
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.169
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

00:35:46.794 --> 00:35:50.465
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

00:35:53.968 --> 00:35:57.722
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

00:35:59.932 --> 00:36:02.477
Hey. Hi, Manny.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.438
What's the matter with you?

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:10.109
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

00:36:12.528 --> 00:36:14.614
Sexy.

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:18.409
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

00:36:18.493 --> 00:36:21.954
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.125
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.796
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:34.383
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

00:36:34.509 --> 00:36:37.970
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

00:36:38.054 --> 00:36:41.098
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

00:36:41.182 --> 00:36:43.518
Manny, I need him.

00:36:47.146 --> 00:36:50.149
So, ladies, where were we?

00:36:50.483 --> 00:36:53.152
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

00:36:55.863 --> 00:37:00.159
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:04.080
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

00:37:04.205 --> 00:37:08.042
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

00:37:10.336 --> 00:37:14.006
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:18.803
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

00:37:18.928 --> 00:37:21.430
No fangs, no claws.

00:37:21.556 --> 00:37:24.892
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.979
What's so threatening about you?

00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:36.112
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:42.618
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.541
You think that's funny? How about this?

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.463
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

00:37:55.214 --> 00:37:58.342
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

00:38:04.474 --> 00:38:09.061
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

00:38:09.187 --> 00:38:11.689
Help. Help.

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.983
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

00:38:14.108 --> 00:38:18.279
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.281
Help.

00:38:20.406 --> 00:38:22.950
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

00:38:23.785 --> 00:38:26.037
Over here.

00:38:33.753 --> 00:38:36.255
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:40.301
Wait a minute.

00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:47.767
He's dead all right.

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:49.977
Carnivores have all the fun.

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:57.276
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

00:38:58.111 --> 00:39:00.780
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:03.533
Manny. Manny.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.829
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:10.998
You don't know where it's been.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.836
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

00:39:14.961 --> 00:39:18.047
- I don't eatjunk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:20.550
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

00:39:23.344 --> 00:39:28.307
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:30.476
Fellas.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.813
Thanks for waiting.

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:36.607
Three, two, one...

00:39:39.569 --> 00:39:41.612
Sure is faithful.

00:39:56.502 --> 00:39:58.629
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

00:39:58.754 --> 00:40:01.966
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

00:40:34.749 --> 00:40:37.627
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:54.143
Hiya, Manny.

00:40:56.103 --> 00:40:58.314
Hi, Diego.

00:41:05.238 --> 00:41:07.281
Hey, Sid.

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:11.410
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

00:41:11.494 --> 00:41:13.830
Ask him directions.

00:41:13.955 --> 00:41:16.624
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.794
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

00:41:22.964 --> 00:41:25.925
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.471
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:32.723
Let me try. Pack.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:37.061
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

00:41:38.604 --> 00:41:40.648
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

00:41:40.773 --> 00:41:43.443
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:45.611
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

00:41:46.028 --> 00:41:48.281
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:51.325
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

00:41:51.617 --> 00:41:53.661
Pack of flying fish.

00:42:43.085 --> 00:42:45.338
Great news. I found a short cut.

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:52.303
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:54.555
I know what a short cut is.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.936
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

00:43:00.186 --> 00:43:03.773
Through there? What do you take me for?

00:43:03.856 --> 00:43:07.318
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

00:43:07.777 --> 00:43:10.446
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peekaboo.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.407
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

00:43:15.785 --> 00:43:18.287
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

00:43:20.456 --> 00:43:22.500
No, thanks. I choose life.

00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:25.211
Then I suggest you take the short cut.

00:43:25.378 --> 00:43:29.173
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.639
Way to go, tiger.

00:43:36.722 --> 00:43:39.225
Quick. Get inside.

00:44:01.956 --> 00:44:04.584
OK, I vote short cut.

00:44:19.182 --> 00:44:22.852
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

00:44:38.493 --> 00:44:40.536
Guys?

00:44:57.887 --> 00:44:59.889
A fish.

00:45:42.265 --> 00:45:46.352
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

00:46:31.647 --> 00:46:33.691
I gotcha.

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.835
Captain, iceberg ahead.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.344
Oh, no.

00:47:52.687 --> 00:47:54.939
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

00:47:59.444 --> 00:48:01.487
Tell the kid to be more careful.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.656
Look, look. Tigers.

00:48:47.742 --> 00:48:52.455
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:59.003
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

00:48:59.128 --> 00:49:01.172
You're it.

00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:05.551
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:08.513
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

00:49:08.638 --> 00:49:12.183
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

00:49:12.308 --> 00:49:15.478
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

00:49:16.395 --> 00:49:18.689
And he's got a family.

00:49:18.815 --> 00:49:22.151
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

00:49:22.276 --> 00:49:25.947
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

00:49:26.072 --> 00:49:28.783
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

00:49:28.908 --> 00:49:30.326
- Sid.
- What?

00:49:30.451 --> 00:49:32.495
- Shut up.
- But...

00:53:00.286 --> 00:53:02.538
Would you look at that.

00:53:02.663 --> 00:53:05.666
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

00:53:05.792 --> 00:53:08.461
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

00:53:08.878 --> 00:53:12.632
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

00:53:12.757 --> 00:53:14.801
You're almost home.

00:53:19.555 --> 00:53:22.058
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash

00:53:22.183 --> 00:53:25.520
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

00:53:25.645 --> 00:53:28.815
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.864
Tell me that was your stomach.

00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:39.158
I'm sure it was just thunder.

00:53:39.492 --> 00:53:42.370
From underground?

00:54:02.682 --> 00:54:04.809
Come on, keep up with me.

00:54:04.934 --> 00:54:07.687
I would if you were moving.

00:54:10.106 --> 00:54:13.234
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

00:54:17.655 --> 00:54:21.993
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

00:54:41.262 --> 00:54:43.306
Hold Pinky.

00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:16.923
Manny.

00:55:28.392 --> 00:55:33.064
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

00:55:35.483 --> 00:55:37.527
What? What? I can't hear you.

00:55:37.735 --> 00:55:39.946
You're standing on my trunk.

00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:45.409
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

00:55:45.535 --> 00:55:48.246
You could have died, trying to save me.

00:55:48.704 --> 00:55:51.249
That's what you do in a herd.

00:55:51.374 --> 00:55:53.501
You look out for each other.

00:55:53.709 --> 00:55:55.962
Well, thanks.

00:55:58.172 --> 00:56:02.718
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

00:56:21.112 --> 00:56:24.115
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.994
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

00:56:31.414 --> 00:56:34.083
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

00:56:34.167 --> 00:56:38.337
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

00:56:38.463 --> 00:56:42.133
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

00:56:42.258 --> 00:56:45.428
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

00:56:45.553 --> 00:56:48.514
Mammoths don't go down easy.

00:56:48.806 --> 00:56:51.100
There's only one way to do it.

00:56:51.267 --> 00:56:53.769
First, you have to force it into a corner.

00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:58.441
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

00:56:58.733 --> 00:57:00.818
I'll go for the throat.

00:57:10.828 --> 00:57:13.581
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

00:57:17.877 --> 00:57:20.129
- How much further?
- Three miles.

00:57:20.254 --> 00:57:23.591
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

00:57:26.761 --> 00:57:30.389
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:36.437
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

00:57:36.562 --> 00:57:38.606
And make him rounder.

00:57:41.192 --> 00:57:44.946
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:54.413
I'm a genius.

00:57:58.126 --> 00:58:03.047
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:06.676
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

00:58:14.725 --> 00:58:18.688
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

00:58:18.813 --> 00:58:21.107
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

00:58:21.232 --> 00:58:24.318
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

00:58:24.902 --> 00:58:27.071
Lovebirds.

00:58:27.196 --> 00:58:29.240
Look at this.

00:58:33.202 --> 00:58:35.246
I don't believe it.

00:58:48.718 --> 00:58:53.681
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

00:58:53.806 --> 00:58:55.975
Come to Uncle Sid.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:59.103
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

00:59:00.229 --> 00:59:02.899
No, no, no. No, go to him.

00:59:04.066 --> 00:59:06.110
Go to him.

00:59:08.529 --> 00:59:09.781
OK.

00:59:11.199 --> 00:59:14.911
Good job. Keep practisin'.

00:59:17.872 --> 00:59:21.000
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

00:59:23.336 --> 00:59:26.339
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

00:59:32.011 --> 00:59:34.055
Look at that big pushover.

00:59:35.681 --> 00:59:39.977
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

00:59:40.436 --> 00:59:44.732
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

00:59:45.191 --> 00:59:47.235
Yeah, he is.

00:59:47.985 --> 00:59:50.363
Well, good night.

01:00:22.478 --> 01:00:28.025
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

01:00:28.901 --> 01:00:32.947
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

01:00:33.072 --> 01:00:36.868
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

01:00:36.993 --> 01:00:39.036
Diego, what do you think?

01:00:40.788 --> 01:00:43.124
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

01:00:43.249 --> 01:00:47.003
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

01:00:47.253 --> 01:00:49.630
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

01:00:49.755 --> 01:00:54.302
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

01:00:54.886 --> 01:01:00.224
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

01:01:19.577 --> 01:01:21.704
Diego. You frozen back there?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.960
- Get down.
- What?

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:30.338
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

01:01:30.463 --> 01:01:35.468
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

01:01:35.593 --> 01:01:37.845
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.225
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.895
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.773
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

01:01:48.898 --> 01:01:50.942
No, you're not. Not yet.

01:01:51.192 --> 01:01:54.821
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:58.157
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:01.536
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:03.704
Because I'm your only chance.

01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:19.387
Hello, ladies.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:25.726
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

01:02:25.852 --> 01:02:32.066
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:33.901
Very nice.

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:37.363
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:42.827
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

01:02:44.078 --> 01:02:46.539
You want to maul something, don't you?

01:02:46.664 --> 01:02:50.126
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:55.798
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:20.990
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:38.674
Loop-de-loop.

01:03:39.717 --> 01:03:41.844
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:11.374
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:15.086
Get him.

01:04:18.131 --> 01:04:20.174
Surprise!

01:04:25.138 --> 01:04:29.767
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

01:04:29.892 --> 01:04:33.813
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.494
There he is.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.999
That's right. Where's the baby?

01:04:56.919 --> 01:05:00.173
Survival of the fittest.

01:05:00.298 --> 01:05:03.092
I don't think so. Yeah.

01:05:14.353 --> 01:05:18.816
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:24.781
Fine. I'll take you down first.

01:06:40.773 --> 01:06:42.817
We did it.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.249
We were some team, huh?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.378
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

01:07:02.879 --> 01:07:05.423
I'm sorry I set you up.

01:07:05.965 --> 01:07:08.759
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

01:07:12.138 --> 01:07:14.182
Knock it off, squirt.

01:07:15.183 --> 01:07:17.185
You gotta be strong.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.855
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

01:07:21.898 --> 01:07:23.900
Especially Sid.

01:07:24.025 --> 01:07:27.862
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

01:07:27.987 --> 01:07:31.073
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

01:07:31.199 --> 01:07:33.451
Come on, Diego, come on.

01:07:33.576 --> 01:07:35.703
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

01:07:37.288 --> 01:07:40.917
Listen, you have to leave me here.

01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:45.213
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.925
You didn't have to do that.

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.761
That's what you do in a herd.

01:11:07.582 --> 01:11:09.625
Don't forget about us.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.794
OK?

01:11:14.046 --> 01:11:16.757
We won't forget about you.

01:11:56.422 --> 01:11:59.008
Goodbye.

01:11:59.091 --> 01:12:01.552
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:12:01.677 --> 01:12:03.971
- Sid...
- Bye.

01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:07.475
Bye.

01:12:10.269 --> 01:12:12.647
That's right. Where's the baby?

01:12:12.814 --> 01:12:15.316
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:35.294
Bye.

01:12:36.462 --> 01:12:39.924
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

01:12:40.466 --> 01:12:42.510
Diego? You're OK.

01:12:42.677 --> 01:12:45.847
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

01:12:45.972 --> 01:12:48.015
You're OK.

01:12:48.724 --> 01:12:50.768
I could kiss ya.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.689
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

01:12:54.814 --> 01:12:57.775
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

01:12:57.984 --> 01:13:02.405
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:05.032
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

01:13:05.616 --> 01:13:09.078
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

01:13:12.874 --> 01:13:15.460
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

01:13:15.585 --> 01:13:20.465
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:24.343
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

01:13:24.469 --> 01:13:27.763
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

01:13:27.889 --> 01:13:30.933
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...
