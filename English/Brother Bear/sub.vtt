00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.473
<i>This is a story from long ago,</i>

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.144
<i>when the great mammoths</i>
<i>still roamed our lands.</i>

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.900
<i>It's the story</i>
<i>of my two brothers and me.</i>

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.352
<i>When the three of us were young,</i>

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:04.110
<i>we were taught</i>
<i>that the world is full of magic.</i>

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:13.323
<i>The source of this magic</i>
<i>is the ever-changing lights</i>

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.576
<i>that dance across the sky.</i>

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.164
<i>The shaman woman of our village</i>

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:25.214
<i>told us that these lights</i>
<i>are the spirits of our ancestors,</i>

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:29.845
<i>and that they have the power</i>
<i>to make changes in our world.</i>

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.055
<i>Small things become big.</i>

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.688
<i>Winter turns to spring.</i>

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.532
<i>One thing always changes</i>
<i>into another.</i>

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.780
<i>But the greatest change I ever saw</i>

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.740
<i>was that of my brother,</i>

00:01:55.365 --> 00:02:00.371
<i>a boy who desperately</i>
<i>wanted to be a man.</i>

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.713
- Get down.
- What?

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.011
Get down! Get down!

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.307
Kenai.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.751
Never try to milk a caribou.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.792
No. No, don't. No. Come on, don't. No.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:49.261
Hey. Will you two knock it off?

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.964
That's all right.
After today, he won't treat me like that.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:56.138
Oh, right, the big manhood ceremony.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.021
Doesn't matter what the spirits say,
you'll always be our baby brother.

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.976
- Well, wait till I get my totem.
- Baby brother.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.778
Hey, I said knock it off.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:10.107
The quicker we get these fish,
the faster we get to your ceremony.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.111
Let's all just try and get along
for a few hours. Okay, Denahi?

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.446
- Whatever you say.
- Okay, Ken...

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.824
So, what are we waiting for?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.171
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:33.305
<i>When the Earth was young</i>
<i>and the air was sweet</i>

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:38.143
<i>And the mountains kissed the sky</i>

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.222
<i>In the great beyond</i>

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.683
<i>With its many paths</i>

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:48.654
<i>Man and nature lived side by side</i>

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.701
<i>In this wilderness of danger and beauty</i>

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:59.991
<i>Lived three brothers bonded by love</i>

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.837
<i>Their hearts full of joy</i>

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.334
<i>They ask now for guidance</i>

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:11.760
<i>Reaching out to the skies up above</i>

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.047
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.846
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:23.305
<i>Fill our hearts and souls</i>
<i>with all you know</i>

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.188
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.361
<i>We are all the same</i>

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:34.692
<i>Brothers to each other</i>
<i>in this world we remain</i>

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.786
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:42.037
<i>Give us wisdom to pass to each other</i>

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:47.205
<i>And give us strength so we understand</i>

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.250
<i>That the things we do</i>

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.423
<i>The choices we make</i>

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:58.349
<i>Give direction to all life's plans</i>

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:04.723
<i>To look and wonder</i>
<i>at all we've been given</i>

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.985
<i>In a world that's not always as it seems</i>

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.322
<i>Every corner we turn</i>

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.946
<i>Only leads to another</i>

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:21.405
<i>A journey ends but another begins</i>

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.834
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.583
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:32.917
<i>Fill our hearts and souls</i>
<i>with all you know</i>

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.970
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.047
<i>We are all the same</i>

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.596
<i>Brothers to each other</i>
<i>in this world we remain</i>

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.223
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.808
- Kenai's back.
- Kenai.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:53.486
Kenai, are you excited
about getting your spirit rock today?

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.815
It's not a rock. It'll be my totem.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.032
Ooh!

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:01.362
I'll probably get a sabre-tooth tiger
for bravery,

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.446
or strength, or greatness.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.996
- Something that fits me.
- A mammoth for your fat head?

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:10.124
- Make sure you get that basket tied up.
- Don't worry.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.789
No stupid bear
is gonna get near this fish.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.541
Just tie it up.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.877
Just tie it up.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.510
- She's back. Tanana's back.
- Come on.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.184
- Come on, Kenai, let's go.
- Come on.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.512
Tanana's got your rock.
Come on.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.983
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.360
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.820
<i>Fill our hearts and souls</i>
<i>with all you know</i>

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:46.706
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.534
<i>We are all the same</i>

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:54.169
<i>Brothers to each other</i>
<i>in this world we remain</i>

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.877
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:02.840
<i>Brothers all the same</i>

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:04.883
Nana.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:09.559
- Hey, Nana.
- Well, hello there, sweetheart.

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.016
What a big girl.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:20.115
When each of us comes of age,
the great spirits reveal to us a totem

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.069
that helps guide us through our lives.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.701
Some of us use courage to guide us.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.741
Others patience.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.796
And some of us beauty.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.213
Kenai.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.469
- You nervous?
- Excited.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.600
You should be.
It's a good one.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:53.148
Kenai, I have been to the mountain
where the lights touch the earth,

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:58.024
and the great spirits
have revealed to me your totem.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:04.694
To become a man, your actions
must be guided by one thing.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:09.497
Your totem is...

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.918
Love.

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:18.090
- What?
- Yes, love.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.251
The bear of love?

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:25.802
A love that connects
and unites all living things.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.850
- Who wants to trade?
- There is no trading.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.599
Oh, Kenai,

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.647
love is the most precious of totems.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.943
It reveals itself in unexpected ways.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:43.444
Let love guide your actions,
then one day you'll be a man,

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:48.912
and we'll place your mark
next to those of our ancestors.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.464
Oh.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.391
There he is.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.724
Come here, lover boy.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.480
- Leave me alone.
- Kenai, wait.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.854
- I'm sorry.
- What?

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.523
Your totem, I think it's really great.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:28.318
- You do?
- Yeah. And I made you something.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.652
Really?

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.530
Now when you skip around
loving everybody,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.204
you'll smell so sweet.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.160
Well, isn't this nice?

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.662
Instead of fighting,
you're giving each other flowers.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:43.508
Yeah, isn't it lovely?
He's so in touch with his totem already.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.878
Hey, dog breath,
go take care of the fish.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.048
Sure. Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.928
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves...

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.856
- Kenai.
- Someday I'm gonna just...

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.608
- He's just such a...
- Hey, bonehead.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:03.857
Just because his totem is wisdom
doesn't mean he's wise.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:07.237
- I mean, look at him.
- Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.693
- Hi, Denahi.
- Oh, hi.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.570
Let go!

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.573
Yeah, the spirits messed up
on both of our totems.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:18.076
I felt the same way
when Tanana gave me mine.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.078
- Get out of here.
- No, really.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:24.208
I said, "The eagle of guidance?
What does that mean?"

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.210
But now that I'm older,
I know it's about being a leader

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.053
and keeping an eye on you two.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.766
I just want to get my handprint
on that wall.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:38.429
Just be patient, Kenai.
When you live by your totem, you will.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.557
- Really?
- Guarantee it.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.147
But come on, the bear of love?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.399
I mean, a bear doesn't love anyone.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.403
They don't think. They don't feel.
I mean, they're...

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.707
- They're thieves.
- You didn't tie it up, did you?

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:58.829
Uh...

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.618
You should get the totem of pinheads.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:01.911
Knock it off.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.080
- We'll just make another basket.
- We?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.710
Oh, no. It took me two weeks
to make that basket.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.754
Get lover boy to do it.
He's the one always messing things up.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:15.054
- Typical Kenai.
- All right, I'll go get your basket.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:18.095
Kenai, wait. Kenai!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.440
What?

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:46.957
Kenai!

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.667
Kenai!

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.762
- Where'd he go?
- If we're lucky, far away.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.597
Kenai!

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.858
- Kenai.
- Sitka, no, you gotta get out of here.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.810
- What?
- The bear. Behind you.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.483
Hey, bear, come on. Over here.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.859
Come on, bear, come this way.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:29.795
Denahi!

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.095
- Hold on.
- Pull.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.954
Sitka. Sitka!

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.192
Sitka.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.373
Come on!

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.174
- Sitka!
- Sitka!

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.295
Sitka. Sitka!

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.094
- Sitka?
- Sitka, where are you?

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.133
Kenai.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.688
No.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.865
Sitka!

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.239
Sitka!

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.490
Denahi, let's find him!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.833
Sitka.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.669
Sitka, where are you? Sitka!

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:36.106
- You ready?
- For what?

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.187
For going after the bear.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:43.868
I know what you're feeling,
but killing that bear is wrong.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.788
Wrong? Our brother is dead
and it's because of that monster.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.746
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.792
- I see.
- Killing the bear won't make you a man.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.251
Now you're trying to be wise.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:03.050
I'm trying to follow my totem.
Why can't you?

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.257
You really think love
has anything to do with being a man?

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:09.306
A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:13.519
Kenai. Don't upset the spirits.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:17.481
Spirits.
Thanks for your wisdom.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.546
I've got to stop him.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.431
You left too soon, Sitka.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:58.025
Your brothers need your guidance.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.922
Ha!

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.763
Kenai.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.826
What?

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.564
Sitka.

00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:54.339
No.

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:52.143
<i>I don't blame the bear, Kenai.</i>

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:58.566
<i>A man wouldn't just sit here</i>
<i>and do nothing.</i>

00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:53.747
So, Kenai,
you've decided to join the living.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:56.291
Ooh-hoo.
That's quite a bump you've got.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.294
That must have been one heck of a ride
down the rapids.

00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:00.795
Tanana?

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:06.221
Ooh.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.298
Nana, you won't believe this.

00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:10.767
I was at the top of this rock,
and all of a sudden...

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.558
Kenai, honey. Shh-shh-shh.

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:18.692
I don't speak bear.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:25.608
No.

00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:30.329
No, no! No!

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:37.666
All right! All right! All right!
Would you settle down? Settle!

00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:40.794
Kenai! Kenai...

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:44.844
Kenai. Kenai. This isn't going to work.

00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:51.718
Kenai, listen to me. Sitka did this.

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:57.811
Strange. Spirits don't usually
make these kind of changes.

00:25:58.182 --> 00:26:00.809
Oh. Oh, my, my, my, my.

00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:04.029
Sitka must have something really big
planned for you. Yep, yep.

00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.778
You are going to get
a whole new perspective on things.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.361
Oh! Do you see
in black and white or colour?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:14.990
Hey. Listen to me.
You got yourself into this mess.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.335
If you want to change,
take it up with your brother's spirit.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:24.751
You'll find him on the mountain
where the lights touch the earth.

00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:27.507
He'll help you make up
for what you've done wrong.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:30.339
But I didn't do anything wrong.

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:33.259
Tanana? Tanana!

00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:36.266
Wait. I didn't do anything wrong.

00:26:37.387 --> 00:26:40.057
- I don't even know how to get there.
- What happened to them?

00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:41.183
I don't know.

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.393
They were here.
Now they're gone.

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:45.395
Yeah, that's pretty weird.

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:49.700
So you're telling me you didn't eat them
and you have no idea where they are?

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:53.403
- Uh-uh.
- Hey, hey, you. You just talked.

00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:56.623
Just back away, real slow-like.

00:26:56.698 --> 00:27:00.373
- How did you do that?
- I knew you had them.

00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:02.871
Are we there yet?

00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:05.624
Don't make me
turn this formation around.

00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:11.130
Hey. Wait. Come back.
I'm trying to find where the lights...

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:15.844
- What's he getting worked up about?
- Maybe the goose pooped on him, eh?

00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:20.142
Oh, gee. He's looking over here.
Let's beat it. This way.

00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:23.317
- No, this way.
- Thank you very much.

00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:25.895
- Just stay still and...
- Hey, you two!

00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:28.105
Head down.

00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:30.107
I think he's seen us. Now what?

00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:32.906
- Act like we're not here.
- We're not here.

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.279
- Shh! What are you doing?
- You said to...

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.072
- Don't say anything. Shh!
- Okay.

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.415
- I said, "Don't say anything."
- Um, excuse me.

00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:42.996
- Don't eat us.
- You won't like us, eh? We're gamey.

00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:45.080
Yeah. Eat hoof-for-brains over there.

00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:47.791
- Pine-cone breath.
- Crusty tail.

00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:49.259
- Twig legs.
- Big nose.

00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:52.754
- Sorry.
- You went too far that time.

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.677
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Guys.

00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:58.101
- Yours is bigger than mine.
- I'm not eating anybody.

00:27:58.218 --> 00:27:59.891
Oh, whew.

00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:02.814
- That's mighty decent of you, eh.
- My name's Rutt.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.109
- This is my brother Tuke.
- How's it going, Bear?

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:09.738
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry, uh...

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:13.822
- Mr. Bear?
- I mean, I'm not a bear. I hate bears.

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.951
- Well, gee, you're one big beaver.
- No kidding, eh?

00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:21.121
Do either of you know
where the lights touch the earth?

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.078
Yee... ahh...

00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:27.998
No. Uh, no. Sorry, bear... Er, beaver.

00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:31.668
I'm not a beaver, I'm a bear...
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.

00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:33.962
- I'm a man.
- Excuse me.

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:36.632
I was transformed into a bear.

00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:40.344
Magically. I was lifted into the sky
by my brother.

00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:41.812
Uh-huh.

00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:44.139
- Crazy.
- Gesundheit.

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:46.233
No. Fruitcake.

00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:49.232
- Are you okay?
- No. That bear. Over there.

00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:51.530
- He's crazy.
- I am not crazy.

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:54.862
Whoever said you were?
We understand.

00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:57.152
- You do?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:59.321
You see, we're not moose either.

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:00.823
- We're not?
- No.

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:04.285
We're like, uh...
We're like squirrels. Yeah.

00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:07.087
Oh. Oh, yeah. Beauty, eh?

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:12.000
Well, he's actually the squirrel.
I'm more of a purebred wolverine.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.219
Look at these cuspids.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.674
- Give him a little room.
- Why am I talking to moose?

00:29:18.674 --> 00:29:21.223
- No, we're squirrels, eh.
- Wolverine.

00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:24.346
I'll find it myself.

00:29:25.264 --> 00:29:27.767
- Oh, I wouldn't go that way.
- Why not, eh?

00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:30.860
Uh, well, there was a reason.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:33.280
- You brought it up.
- I'm trying to...

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.484
Ow!

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.572
Ow!

00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:45.376
- So, you think of it yet?
- Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.661
Ow.

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:03.051
Hey. Is the coast clear?

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.888
- What?
- Are there any hunters around?

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:08.398
- Uh... No.
- Oh, good!

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.226
You didn't see the trap?

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:15.276
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.

00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:16.607
Don't worry.

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:20.072
I won't tell anyone.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:22.663
- What?
- You need to get down. Let me help.

00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:24.331
Oh, wait. Ow!

00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:27.000
- Hold still.
- Just... Stop that. Ow!

00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.169
If you just...

00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:32.127
- Stop it!
- It's no use.

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:36.918
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.

00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:40.889
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.

00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:43.262
- Okay, here.
- No, I'll do it myself.

00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:45.936
Put it back. No, where you found it.

00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.930
- Oh.
- To the left. By the little rock.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.352
- Here?
- Yes.

00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:51.809
Okay.

00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:55.604
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:58.699
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.

00:30:58.774 --> 00:31:00.026
All kinds of trees.

00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:05.865
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars,
maples, birch trees, willow trees...

00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:08.116
My eyes were watering
and my tongue was swollen.

00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:11.791
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:21.597
Ha! See? It's all about using your head.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.515
That was funny. Do it again.

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:31.269
- Don't you have someplace to go?
- Yeah, the salmon run.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.478
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.

00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:39.482
- Deal?
- Yeah, okay, fine.

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.989
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:46.117
- Salmon run.
- Whatever. But if you can't...

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:50.501
You turn around, walk away,
and never come back, ever.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.369
- You swear?
- Yeah.

00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:55.339
- Pinky swear?
- Yeah, sure, fine, pinky swear.

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:58.338
But this is a human trap
and you're just a dumb little bear.

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.511
There's no way
you're going to be able...

00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:09.098
Okay, so I'm thinking
we travel by day and sleep by night.

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:12.021
My bedtime is an hour after sunset...

00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.525
Run!

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:17.815
Yeah, good riddance.

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.244
Denahi.

00:32:34.244 --> 00:32:35.712
Denahi, you found me.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.507
You wouldn't believe
what a nightmare this has been.

00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:43.553
Denahi? It's me. Kenai.

00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:18.580
Is he gone?

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.423
- I think he was going...
- Shh!

00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.760
Hello. I can't breathe.

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:48.653
- Why is he chasing me?
- That's what they do.

00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:52.456
- But it's not like him.
- Lucky for him, he didn't find us

00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:55.330
'cause when I get in a fight,
I go all crazy

00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:57.877
and I'm a raging ball of brown fur.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.841
I mean, I don't want to brag or nothing,
but I got some moves.

00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:06.761
- Oh, really?
- Yep. This first one, well...

00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:10.966
It's just a little thing
I like to call "The Slasher."

00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:15.563
And this one I like to call
"Flying Fury of Death."

00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:19.145
- Uh-huh. He's coming back.
- Where?

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.897
Typical.

00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:25.231
Yeah, well,
the next time we run into that hunter...

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:28.988
There is no "we."
I'm not taking you to any salmon run.

00:34:29.192 --> 00:34:31.661
What? But you pinky swore.

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.488
Yeah, well, things change.

00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:35.824
See you, kid.

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:38.584
Wait, uh...

00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:46.042
The truth is,
I got separated from my mom.

00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:48.837
And now, with this hunter around...

00:34:48.837 --> 00:34:52.933
- Kid, I got my own problems.
- Come on. Please.

00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:56.888
Can't we just go together?
There's a lot of bears and a ton of fish,

00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:00.600
and every night we watch the lights
touch the mountain. Last year...

00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:03.727
- Wait, wait. What did you say?
- Lots of bears and fish.

00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:06.105
No. You know
where the lights touch the earth?

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:09.190
Yeah! The top of the mountain
right by the salmon run.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:12.740
- You're kidding me.
- No, no, they're practically next door.

00:35:12.819 --> 00:35:15.197
Come on, I'll show you. It'll be great.

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:19.789
I promise to help you escape
from every trap you walk into.

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:21.586
I'm not going to walk into any more...

00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:27.089
- Traps.
- Come on. What do you say?

00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:31.546
Sure you can take me
to where the lights touch the earth?

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.389
Yeah, no problem.

00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:42.186
- If you slow me down...
- I won't, I promise.

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:45.811
All right, we leave first thing tomorrow.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.243
And keep all that cuddly bear stuff
to a minimum, okay, kid?

00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:05.213
My name's not "kid." It's Koda.

00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.673
What's your name?

00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:22.271
- Good day.
- How's it going, eh?

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:26.693
Beauty. So we got a lot to get done
today. You want to get started?

00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:28.770
- Yeah. Just give me one sec, eh?
- Okay.

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.274
Woo-oo-hoo...

00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:34.659
- Just help me crack this.
- All right.

00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:36.277
Ah.

00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:38.621
- You ready now?
- Almost.

00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.997
Just want to do "dog facing forward."

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:47.122
- Oh, come on.
- Good. Okay.

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:48.749
And go.

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:52.460
This a nice patch here.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.964
Don't go near this patch here.
Something went here.

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.245
Ahh!

00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:39.340
Skinny. Fat. Skinny. Fat.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.344
Hey, I've got a mountain to get to.
Come on, kid.

00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:45.894
I told you before. My name's Koda.

00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:49.017
Say it with me. Ko... Da.

00:37:49.017 --> 00:37:52.021
Sure your mom didn't ditch you,
Ko-duh?

00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:54.356
Humph.

00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:03.372
- Rutt.
- Go away, eh, I'm eating twigs.

00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:06.710
- Rutt.
- You're breaking my concentration.

00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:09.538
We should start running, like now!

00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:14.047
I can't. I'm still digesting, eh.
I'll get cramps.

00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:23.351
- Whoa, gee! He's after us!
- Come on, little brother.

00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:25.887
Cramp!

00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:30.391
If you really want to know
how me and my mom got separated...

00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:34.897
I was saving this story
for the salmon run, but I'll tell you.

00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:41.244
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.414
- Sounds good. You should save it.
- You think so?

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.912
- Oh, yeah. For your friends.
- Oh.

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:50.078
- Well, I have this other story.
- Tell you what.

00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:53.290
- How about no talking?
- Okay.

00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:55.750
- Then I'll sing.
- No, no, no.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.419
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

00:38:58.419 --> 00:38:59.796
Will you stop it?

00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:01.965
<i>New friends and new places to see</i>

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:03.633
Come on, quit it. Shh!

00:39:03.633 --> 00:39:06.469
Koda, stop singing.

00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:08.972
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:13.435
<i>And there's nowhere else</i>
<i>that I'd rather be</i>

00:39:14.644 --> 00:39:18.606
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:22.452
<i>And I'm loving every step I take</i>

00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:27.457
<i>With the sun beating down</i>
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

00:39:27.991 --> 00:39:31.962
<i>And I can't keep this smile off my face</i>

00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:37.168
<i>'Cause there's nothing like</i>
<i>seeing each other again</i>

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.221
<i>No matter what the distance between</i>

00:39:42.088 --> 00:39:48.687
<i>And the stories that we tell</i>
<i>will make you smile</i>

00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:52.733
<i>Oh, it really lifts my heart</i>

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:56.311
<i>So tell them all I'm on my way</i>

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:00.695
<i>New friends and new places to see</i>

00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:05.700
<i>And to sleep under the stars</i>
<i>Who could ask for more?</i>

00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:09.328
<i>With the moon keeping watch over me</i>

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:15.204
<i>Not the snow, not the rain</i>
<i>can change my mind</i>

00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:19.542
<i>The sun will come out, wait and see</i>

00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:23.342
<i>And the feeling of the wind in your face</i>

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:27.216
<i>Can lift your heart, whoa</i>

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:30.311
<i>There's nowhere I would rather be</i>

00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:35.524
<i>'Cause I'm on my way now</i>

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:40.067
<i>Well and true</i>

00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:44.821
<i>I'm on my way now</i>

00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:48.371
Hey, hold on, eh?

00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:49.572
Wait up.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.203
- How's it going, bear boy?
- And, uh, smallish bear.

00:40:55.203 --> 00:40:57.581
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.

00:40:57.664 --> 00:41:01.589
- Actually, he's...
- There was this hunter following us.

00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:04.921
We was thinking if we could
maybe just hang out with you guys.

00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:07.549
- Just hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be fun.

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:10.886
- If the hunter was going to catch up...
- Then you'd eat him.

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:14.564
- That's what we was thinking.
- We lost the hunter at the glacier.

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:16.516
You don't think he'll follow those?

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.321
- They are quite nice.
- I've got an idea.

00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:23.774
Okay, this is really weird.

00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:28.277
- I'm driving.
- When can I have a turn?

00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:31.406
It's not as easy as it looks.
Just watch what I do.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.084
Let's get a back seat or something.
I look like you hunted me.

00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:38.792
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:40.168
Hey, come on.

00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:43.127
<i>And I just can't wait to be there</i>

00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:48.924
<i>Blue skies ahead</i>
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:54.020
<i>Nothing but good times to share</i>

00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:57.770
<i>So tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:01.937
<i>And I just can't wait to be home</i>

00:42:03.396 --> 00:42:07.697
<i>With the sun beating down</i>
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:12.280
<i>With nothing but good times to show</i>

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.705
<i>I'm on my way</i>

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:19.583
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

00:42:20.663 --> 00:42:22.131
Beauty, eh?

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:27.128
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.

00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.630
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.303
I learned that one the hard way.

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:35.978
That reminds me. Last year at the
salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.

00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:39.182
But I'd heard of a cub
who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.

00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:41.142
Then he started to float away.

00:42:41.142 --> 00:42:44.020
To save him
they had to rip off his tongue,

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.990
so now he hath to talk like thith
all the time and...

00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:49.909
- Do you ever stop talking?
- Oh!

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:52.528
Look. The night rainbow.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:56.658
- You can see the spirits from here.
- You know about the great spirits?

00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:59.995
Yeah, my grandma's up there,
and my granddad.

00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:04.757
Mom says the spirits make
all the magical changes in the world.

00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:08.711
Like how the leaves change colour,
or the moon changes shapes,

00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:12.386
- or tadpoles change into frogs.
- Yeah, I get it.

00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:17.053
You know, for a change, maybe
they could just leave things alone.

00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:20.057
- What do you mean?
- My brother's a spirit.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.063
If it wasn't for him, I...

00:43:23.142 --> 00:43:25.019
I wouldn't be here.

00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:27.322
You have a brother up there?

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.740
- What happened to him?
- He was killed by a...

00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:36.197
By a monster.

00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:43.796
What's your brother's name?

00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.040
Sitka.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.295
Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you,
I would have never met Kenai.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.349
I always wanted a brother.

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:20.412
So, you want to play "I spy"?

00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:23.415
- All right. I'll go first.
- Okay.

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:27.294
I spy something green.

00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:30.918
- Tree?
- Oh!

00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:32.135
- My turn?
- Yeah.

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:35.215
Okay, I spy something tall.

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:38.221
- Tree.
- Okay.

00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:43.349
I spy something with bark.

00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:44.807
Tree?

00:44:44.807 --> 00:44:47.481
Okay, I spy something, uh...

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.904
- A vertical log.
- Tree.

00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:53.279
- Okay, I spy something...
- Tree.

00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:55.155
- My turn.
- Tree.

00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:56.451
- No, I...
- It counts.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.871
- I didn't even spy anything.
- It counts.

00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:01.199
Okay. Tree.

00:45:02.617 --> 00:45:04.619
Let's play something else.

00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:13.845
Koda. Come on.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.220
- Koda, wake up.
- Two more months, Mom.

00:45:20.968 --> 00:45:22.891
So, where are we?

00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:32.693
Well, which way?

00:45:34.315 --> 00:45:37.319
- I think it's that way.
- You think, or you know?

00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:39.487
That way?

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.999
Why wasn't I turned
into a homing pigeon?

00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:46.666
- Come on.
- Hey, riding mammoths was your idea.

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.205
Thanks for the ride, guys. See you.

00:45:49.205 --> 00:45:51.754
Lucky for you,
I've been lost worse than this.

00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:55.044
- Last summer, I was with Bucky...
- Enough with the stories.

00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:57.505
I don't care about the time
you and Binky found

00:45:57.505 --> 00:46:00.054
the world's biggest pine cone ever.

00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:04.012
First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.

00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:06.564
Second, it wasn't a pine cone,
it was a pine nut.

00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:09.688
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.

00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:12.395
Oh, gee,
our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?

00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:14.856
Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on.

00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:18.067
- Can you swing your leg...
- I can't get off.

00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:20.903
Me, neither. Okay, you guys...

00:46:20.903 --> 00:46:24.908
I guess we'll just catch up
with those guys later, eh?

00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:27.910
- Good trip, eh?
- Beauty.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.790
You know, I was thinking now
might be a good time for me to drive.

00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:34.421
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.218
Yeah. Okay.

00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:38.546
Whee.

00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:42.137
I'm sorry we're lost, okay?

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:45.094
- Even though it's your fault.
- My fault?

00:46:45.094 --> 00:46:46.562
That's it.

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:50.312
Just remember, if it weren't for me,
you'd be hanging upside down.

00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:54.770
Better than being stuck nowhere
with you and your blabbering mouth.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.399
"I'm lost. I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me to the salmon run?"

00:46:58.399 --> 00:47:01.448
- Why don't you just grow up?
- Fine. I'll go on my own then.

00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:03.738
- Fine. Go ahead.
- Fine.

00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.081
- Fine.
- Fine.

00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:24.225
Koda?

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.427
Koda?

00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:35.941
Whoa.

00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:33.870
Those monsters are really scary.

00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:37.169
Especially with those sticks.

00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:56.484
Come on, let's go.

00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:01.030
So, you recognise anything yet?

00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:03.862
Or maybe you can't see past
my fat head.

00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:09.739
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?

00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:13.201
Well, if you hunched your shoulders
a little it wouldn't seem so big.

00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:15.744
Oh, you mean like this?

00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:17.621
Or like this?

00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:19.707
How about this?

00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:22.918
Oh, my, that was good.

00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:25.046
Maybe they can
give us directions.

00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:27.135
Oh!

00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:29.091
- That clears up the sinuses.
- Oh, it does.

00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:31.385
Okay, okay, hit me again.
I think she's looking.

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:35.764
- Hello, sweetie.
- Yes, she's checking me out, all right.

00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:38.233
- Hey, baby.
- No, come on, you nitwit.

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:40.607
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.

00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:43.656
Like she's looking at your ugly mug?
Come on.

00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:46.075
Excuse me, miss. It's go-time, baby.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.152
You want to go? Bring it on.

00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:49.908
- Horns up.
- Hold on.

00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:52.740
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.459
- What is that?
- Just a minute, bear.

00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:58.245
Hey, shut up.

00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:02.791
No, you shut up.

00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:04.793
Hey, will you shut up?

00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:08.256
Just shut up.

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:10.717
Their horns are screwed on too tight.

00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:15.099
Oh, wait a second.

00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:18.766
- I know this place.
- You do?

00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:21.110
Yeah. The salmon run's not far.

00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:24.488
We just have to go through here.

00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:39.128
What?

00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:45.125
Hey, you sure you know
where you're going?

00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:47.127
Yeah, yeah, follow me.

00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.099
Koda?

00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.315
Koda?

00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:04.065
Koda?

00:51:04.687 --> 00:51:06.689
Where are you?

00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:12.612
Yah!

00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:17.533
- Don't do that.
- Scared you, didn't I?

00:51:17.533 --> 00:51:21.037
There's scared,
and then there's surprised.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.122
And you were both.

00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:25.336
Whoa!

00:51:35.426 --> 00:51:39.772
Nice try.
Uh, you got a little spit right there.

00:51:43.017 --> 00:51:46.271
- Kenai!
- You're not getting me this time.

00:51:46.353 --> 00:51:47.730
No, look out.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.736
No.

00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:56.113
Come on.

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:11.678
Kenai.

00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.721
Kenai, where are you?

00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:29.655
Left. Left. No, the other left.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.252
Kenai!

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:51.168
Whoa! Whoa!

00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:08.440
No!

00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:15.360
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here.

00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:18.202
Ah!

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.393
Why do they hate us, Kenai?

00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:28.600
- We're bears.
- So?

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:31.894
So, you know how they are.
They're killers.

00:54:31.894 --> 00:54:34.238
Wait a minute, who's the killers?

00:54:34.313 --> 00:54:36.691
- Bears.
- What? Which bears?

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:38.902
I'm not like that, and you're not like that.

00:54:38.984 --> 00:54:42.033
Well, obviously not all bears.
I mean, you're okay.

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:46.533
Most bears will look for any excuse
to attack a human.

00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:49.207
But, Kenai, he attacked us.

00:54:51.663 --> 00:54:54.249
You're just a cub.
When you're older, you'll understand.

00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:56.968
Fish! Fish! Fish!

00:54:57.044 --> 00:54:59.388
- Huh?
- We made it. We're here.

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.761
- Come on!
- What? Koda.

00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:05.056
- Fish! Fish! Fish!
- Hey. Get away from me.

00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:08.351
Get away from me. Go on. Shoo!

00:55:28.659 --> 00:55:29.952
Huh?

00:55:29.952 --> 00:55:32.955
Hey, you're stirring up the water, dude.

00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:35.834
Yeah, try not to scare off
the fish there, buddy.

00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:37.797
- Uh...
- Tug.

00:55:37.876 --> 00:55:40.550
Hey, Koda. Come here.

00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:42.597
Look at you.

00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:47.262
- Have you seen my mom yet?
- No, as a matter of fact I haven't.

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:51.933
- Me and my friend Kenai beat her.
- He's with you?

00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:54.476
Uh... Hi.

00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:59.031
Huh. I've never seen you
at the run before.

00:55:59.106 --> 00:56:02.943
- Where are you from?
- Well, I...

00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:05.867
There's the mountain,
just like I promised.

00:56:05.946 --> 00:56:07.994
The lights touch the top every night.

00:56:08.866 --> 00:56:11.836
Gonna be harder getting up there
than riding those mammoths.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.662
- Mammoths?
- Are you kidding?

00:56:13.662 --> 00:56:15.497
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:19.127
He does weird stuff.
Like the way he drinks water with a leaf.

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.964
He never sharpens his claws on a tree.
He's never hibernated before...

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:25.549
Koda. Koda.

00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:28.636
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.

00:56:29.428 --> 00:56:32.306
Hmm. He's kind of jumpy, isn't he?

00:56:32.306 --> 00:56:34.479
Okay. Okay.

00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.314
Koda, I, uh...

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.065
- Uh, I got to get going.
- Well, when you come back...

00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:43.321
I... I won't be coming back.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.494
What? Why not?

00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:50.032
Because... Well, it's hard to...

00:56:50.032 --> 00:56:52.326
- You're leaving?
- No.

00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:54.579
Well, I mean, yes.

00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:57.039
Well, it's just that I...

00:56:57.122 --> 00:57:00.542
- I don't belong here.
- Don't belong?

00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:04.546
Every bear belongs here.
Come on, buddy.

00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:05.763
<i>Everyone's invited</i>

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:07.011
Let's have some fun!

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.263
<i>This is how we live</i>

00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:13.598
<i>We're all here for each other</i>

00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:17.276
<i>Happy to give</i>

00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:21.863
<i>All we have, we share</i>

00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:25.738
<i>And all of us, we care</i>

00:57:25.817 --> 00:57:27.235
<i>So come on</i>

00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:31.035
<i>Welcome to our family time</i>

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:34.960
<i>Welcome to our brotherly time</i>

00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:40.041
<i>We're happy giving and taking</i>
<i>to the friends we're making</i>

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.751
<i>There's nothing we won't do</i>

00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:45.630
<i>Welcome to our family time</i>

00:57:46.672 --> 00:57:50.427
<i>Welcome to our happy-to-be time</i>

00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:55.731
<i>This is our festival</i>
<i>You know that best of all</i>

00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:58.725
<i>We're here to share it all</i>

00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:04.277
<i>There's a bond between us</i>
<i>nobody can explain</i>

00:58:04.982 --> 00:58:08.610
<i>It's a celebration of life</i>

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.238
<i>And seeing friends again</i>

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.410
<i>I'd be there for you</i>

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:19.746
<i>I know you'd be there for me, too</i>

00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:25.293
<i>- So come on</i>
<i>- Welcome to our family time</i>

00:58:25.293 --> 00:58:29.093
<i>Welcome to our brotherly time</i>

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:34.302
<i>This is our festival</i>
<i>You know, and best of all</i>

00:58:34.302 --> 00:58:37.431
<i>We're here to share it all</i>

00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:40.934
<i>Remembering love once departed</i>

00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:44.609
<i>Someone dear to your heart</i>

00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:48.318
<i>Finding love, planning a future</i>

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.279
<i>Telling stories</i>
<i>and laughing with friends</i>

00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:55.499
<i>Precious moments you'll never forget</i>

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:59.995
<i>This has to be the most beautiful</i>

00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:04.592
<i>The most peaceful place</i>
<i>I've ever been to</i>

00:59:05.167 --> 00:59:10.139
<i>It's nothing like I've ever seen before</i>

00:59:11.798 --> 00:59:15.974
<i>When I think how far I've come</i>
<i>I can't believe it</i>

00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:18.183
<i>Yet I see it</i>

00:59:18.847 --> 00:59:22.647
<i>And then I see family</i>

00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:26.776
<i>I see the way we used to be</i>

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:33.028
<i>- Come on</i>
<i>- Welcome to our family time</i>

00:59:33.028 --> 00:59:36.874
<i>Welcome to our brotherly time</i>

00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:41.995
<i>We're happy giving and taking</i>
<i>to the friends that we're making</i>

00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:44.589
<i>There's nothing we won't do</i>

00:59:44.664 --> 00:59:48.502
<i>Welcome to our family time</i>

00:59:48.502 --> 00:59:52.380
<i>Welcome to our happy-to-be time</i>

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:57.432
<i>This is our festival</i>
<i>You know, and best of all</i>

00:59:57.511 --> 00:59:59.889
<i>You're here to share it</i>

00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:03.942
<i>We're here to share it all</i>

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:15.704
All right, settle down, everyone.
Settle down. Hey.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.532
Don't throw your fish bones there.
Somebody could choke on that.

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.408
Look, okay, I'll go first.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:25.039
Okay, let's see. The most interesting
thing that happened to me this year.

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:26.873
Hmm...

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.126
Oh, I know, I know, I know! Listen to this.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.632
It was when I knocked down that tree

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.930
that was blocking the view
from my cave.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:37.510
Now I got a family of chipmunks
staying in my place.

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:42.146
Yeah.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:44.975
All right, everybody,
let me see some paws in the air.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:48.107
- Who's gonna be next? Come on.
- Tug. I got one.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:51.156
Watch me. Hey, gotcha.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:56.112
This year I lost my dear husband Edgar.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.788
Quit telling everyone I'm dead!

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:03.577
Sometimes I can still hear his voice.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.250
I'm getting the next one.

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:19.972
Oh, yeah.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:26.600
- This is it. I got it. I got...
- I guess it's our turn.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.936
This is the year
I met the most gorgeous...

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.105
No, you're gorgeous.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:35.780
- You're gorgeous-er.
- Get a cave.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.487
If only Edgar was alive...

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:42.115
I told you, woman,
I'm right here!

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:46.286
- I love you, buttercup.
- This has got to be it.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.831
- Here you go, Koda.
- You gotta tell it, Kenai.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:53.005
- What?
- Yes. You caught it, you tell it.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.961
Didn't you play when you were a cub?

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.385
- Um...
- Come on, Keno.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.223
Okay, all right already. All right.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.309
- You want to know what I did this year?
- Yes.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:10.485
I went on the longest, hardest, most
exhausting journey I've ever been on

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.985
with the biggest pain in the neck
I've ever met.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.322
What do you expect
from a little brother?

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:22.530
Okay, buddy, your turn.

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:26.202
- Let's hear it, Koda.
- Okay, okay, here we go.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.664
This year I watched my mom
in a life-and-death struggle

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:33.541
battling the most fiercest creature ever.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.214
- Who's next?
- What?

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:40.048
Wait a minute. I think we all want
to hear the rest of that one, Koda.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:43.723
I thought you might say that.
Hmm... Let's see.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:48.353
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.526
Me and Mom were eating fish,
having a great time.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:56.573
All of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.490
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.202
There's something in the woods
running towards us,

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.784
getting closer and closer.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:12.585
And then, out of the trees,
jumps a hunter.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:17.377
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:21.132
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:29.264
The monster attacks,
but Mom's too quick for him.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:34.862
And before he can do it again, she
stands up real big and yells, "Go away."

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:36.813
<i>Kenai.</i>

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.648
Mom smells more of them.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:40.734
There's a whole pack
coming right at us.

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.236
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.664
<i>She runs to stop them</i>
<i>before they get to me.</i>

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.788
<i>They're all around her,</i>
<i>poking her with sticks.</i>

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:52.667
- Sitka.
<i>- The whole thing broke and fell off.</i>

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.589
<i>There was ice everywhere.</i>

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.417
<i>She couldn't hold her breath</i>
<i>any longer, and pow.</i>

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:01.422
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.637
- <i>I'm going after the bear.</i>
- Koda?

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:06.634
- <i>Sitka wouldn't want it.</i>
- <i>Sitka's not here</i>

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.728
<i>because of that monster.</i>

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:14.476
Whoa. Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:16.604
Can you imagine?

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.944
Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.651
- What happened next?
- Was she okay?

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:27.156
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.492
She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:33.495
Right after that I met Kenai.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:34.667
Kenai?

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:23.171
Scared you again, huh?

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.171
- Yeah.
- Where have you been?

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:26.840
- You look horrible.
- Koda...

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.844
My mom says when
you eat too much fish, just lie down.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.264
There's something I, uh...

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.438
You know that story
you told me last night?

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.854
- Yeah.
- Well, I have a story to tell you.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:43.231
Really? What's it about?

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:46.405
Well, it's kind of about a man,

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:49.078
and kind of about a bear.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:52.203
But mostly it's about a monster.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.535
A monster who did something so bad...

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:59.915
<i>Everywhere I turn I hurt someone</i>

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:06.885
<i>But there's nothing I can say</i>
<i>to change the things I've done</i>

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:11.597
<i>I'd do anything within my power</i>

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:14.805
<i>I'd give everything I've got</i>

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:19.485
<i>But the path I seek</i>
<i>is hidden from me now</i>

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.779
Koda, I did something very wrong.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:27.066
<i>Brother bear, I let you down</i>

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:28.784
I don't like this story.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.907
<i>You trusted me, believed in me</i>
<i>and I let you down</i>

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.580
Your mother's not coming.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:39.003
<i>Of all the things I hid from you</i>

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:41.831
<i>I cannot hide the shame</i>

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.124
<i>And I pray someone</i>

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.292
No. No!

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:49.594
<i>Something will come</i>
<i>to take away the pain</i>

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:53.768
<i>There's no way out</i>

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.097
<i>Of this dark place</i>

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.730
<i>No, no future</i>

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:09.451
<i>I know I can't be free</i>

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:15.283
<i>But I can't see another way</i>

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:21.630
<i>And I can't face another day</i>

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.344
Koda? Koda?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.131
Koda!

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:36.970
Koda, I wish I could...

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:40.815
If there was just some way...

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.563
I'd give anything if...

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:49.191
If I could just...

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:03.338
I'm sorry, Koda.

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.673
I'm so sorry.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.912
I'm sorry, Kenai.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.711
I don't know what I'm doing any more.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.752
I need help.

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.434
Sitka.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.905
Look, I am sorry.

01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:20.907
If I was driving
this never would have happened.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:26.338
- You never let me do nothing.
- Trample off. I said sorry. Let it go.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.748
I can't believe you totalled a mammoth.

01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:32.343
- That mountain came out of nowhere.
- I cannot accept your apology.

01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:36.173
- It was in my blind spot...
- Look. It's that little cub.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.264
- Gee, eh, something's bugging him.
- What's wrong, smallish bear?

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:42.930
Nothing. I'm fine.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:48.434
Good. Where were we? Oh, yeah.
You're a big, selfish, reckless hoofer.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.528
- What?
- I'm fed up with it.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:54.274
- From now on, he's my new brother.
- You can't do that.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:57.985
Sorry, you've been replaced
with my dear brother...

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:59.828
What's your name again?

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:02.282
I don't want any more brothers.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.211
- See? He's had enough of you, too.
- I promise I'll change.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:10.040
Trample off. You won't.
Being a brother means nothing to you.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.458
- Of course it does.
- Like what?

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:14.961
What about when your hooves
froze in the pond?

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:18.548
- Who sat with you all winter, eh?
- You did.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:20.804
Who showed you
where the good grazing is?

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:24.308
The really tender stuff
all covered in dew.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.061
Now, why do you think I did that, eh?

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.142
Because I...

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:32.066
Because I love... dew.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:35.615
Excuse me?
I don't believe I heard what you said.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:38.736
I said, "I love dew."

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.746
I love dew, too, eh.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:45.533
Hey, I can change.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.995
- Go away, eh.
- Come on, I can change.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:52.750
- Go away, eh, don't touch me.
- I can change.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.584
Hey. No.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.715
Not there, that's the spot.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.506
Like, we'll see you later, smallish bear.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:04.431
Yeah, good day, eh.
You know what this calls for?

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:08.890
A pile of delicious barley and amber
weed on a cool bed of malted hops.

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.975
I like it.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.044
Sitka! Sitka, are you there?

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.834
Sitka?

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:38.419
Please. Please, Sitka.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.421
I don't know what else to do.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:45.969
Sitka.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:54.144
Denahi.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.231
Sitka, hurry, change me back.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.578
Where are you, Sitka?

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:36.773
Denahi.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:39.939
Denahi, please.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:45.569
Koda.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.208
No!

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.886
Leave him alone.

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:06.341
Koda!

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.826
Kenai?

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.599
Sitka?

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:21.375
Koda, don't be afraid. It's me.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.094
He needs me.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:16.262
You know, he did look better as a bear.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:29.492
But, Denahi...

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.069
It's all right, Kenai.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:44.207
No matter what you choose,
you'll always be my little brother.

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:05.528
Did I say little?

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.222
Kenai.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.637
<i>My brother Kenai went on</i>
<i>to live with Koda and the other bears.</i>

01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:16.432
<i>He taught me</i>
<i>that love is very powerful.</i>

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:21.312
<i>And I passed on the wisdom</i>
<i>of his story to our people.</i>

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.733
<i>The story of a boy who became a man</i>

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.565
<i>by becoming a bear.</i>

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:32.106
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.942
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:40.039
<i>Fill our hearts and souls</i>
<i>with all you know</i>

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.242
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:46.078
<i>We are all the same</i>

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:51.300
<i>Brothers to each other</i>
<i>in this world we remain</i>

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:54.345
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:59.392
<i>Brothers all the same</i>

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:14.607
So, like, uh, what are you doing there,
smallish bear?

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:17.276
I'm practising my moves.
Want to see one?

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:19.870
Sure, eh.
This ought to be good, eh?

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:29.000
Listen to me. I was a man
that was changed into a bear.

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:32.504
No beaver. Man into bear. That's it.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:36.670
Oh. Yeah, so, before that
you was probably like a goat?

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:39.006
- What about a water buffalo?
- No, he's a rabbit.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:42.509
Look at his ears and furry feet.
Watch out for the rabbit, eh.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:43.844
No way, eh.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:47.690
Okay, now, everyone,
take a big inhale, eh?

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.233
And then on...

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:53.529
On the exhale,
shift into salutation to the sun.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:19:01.746
No, you shut up.

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:14.008
- How you doing over there, Koda?
- Oh, pretty good.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.534
In accordance with all federal
and state wildlife regulations,

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:35.328
no fish were harmed
during the making of this film.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:40.413
No! He's gonna eat me!

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.374
Cut. Cut.

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:46.207
Somebody, help me.
Help me. Somebody.

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:48.088
Ooh!
