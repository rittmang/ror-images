00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.763
-Wow.
-Mmm.

00:00:57.803 --> 00:01:00.897
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:03.066
-Wow.
-Yes, Marlin.

00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:05.201
No, l see it.
lt's beautiful.

00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:07.769
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:11.977
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:15.918
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.934
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.267
-My man delivered.
-And it wasn't so easy.

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:23.604
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.075
You better believe they did--
every single one of them.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.135
Mm-hmm. You did good.

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.807
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:42.486
So, you do like it, don't you?

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:45.985
No, no. l do, l do.
l really do like it.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.965
But, Marlin, l know that
the drop off is desirable...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.264
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:53.071
but do we really need
so much space?

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.366
but do we really need
so much space?

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:56.202
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.402
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.673
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:01.579
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.774
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:06.113
Shh. You'll wake the kids.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.947
Oh, right, right.

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.456
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:18.655
We still have to name them.

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:20.459
You want to name
all of them right now?

00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:23.763
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:25.928
and this half Coral Junior.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.530
-OK, we're done.
-l like Nemo.

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:31.337
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.936
but l'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

00:02:33.978 --> 00:02:35.343
Just think,
in a couple of days...

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.872
-we're going to be parents.
-Yeah.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:40.543
What if they don't like me?

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:42.109
-Marlin.
-No, really.

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:47.113
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.455
What?

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:55.125
-You remember how we met?
-l try not to.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.633
Well, l remember.
''Excuse me, miss...

00:02:56.668 --> 00:02:59.136
''can you check and see
if l have a hook in my lip?''

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.536
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:04.700
-Get away, get away!
-Here he is. Cutie's here.

00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:08.670
Where did everybody go?

00:03:15.453 --> 00:03:17.546
Coral, get inside the house.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.490
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:24.120
Just get inside--
You, right now.

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:28.763
No! Ow!

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.700
Oh!

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:32.396
Ooh! Ooh!

00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:48.547
Coral!

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:56.026
Coral?

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.527
Coral?

00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:07.666
Coral?

00:04:10.108 --> 00:04:11.439
Coral?

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.143
Coral?

00:04:32.697 --> 00:04:33.891
Oh!

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:39.837
Ohh.

00:04:41.873 --> 00:04:43.704
There, there, there.

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:46.232
lt's OK. Daddy's here.

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.139
Daddy's got you.

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:56.511
l promise, l will never
let anything happen to you...

00:04:56.554 --> 00:04:58.317
Nemo.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:37.228
NEMO: First day of school!

00:05:37.228 --> 00:05:40.026
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

00:05:40.064 --> 00:05:42.555
l don't want to go to school--
five more minutes.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.862
Not you, Dad, me.

00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:45.300
-OK. Huh?
-Get up, get up.

00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:48.032
lt's time for school,
time for school.

00:05:48.072 --> 00:05:49.630
All right, l'm up.

00:05:49.674 --> 00:05:51.335
Whoa!

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.104
-Nemo!
-First day of school!

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.305
-Nemo, don't move.
-Unh! Unh!

00:05:55.346 --> 00:05:56.745
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

00:05:56.781 --> 00:05:58.942
l'll do it. Unh!

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.951
-You feel a break?
-No.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.714
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:04.948
-Are you woozy?
-No.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.253
-How many stripes do l have?
-l'm fine.

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:09.088
-Answer the stripe question.
-Three.

00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:10.593
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:13.426
l have one, two, three--
That's all l have?

00:06:13.464 --> 00:06:16.365
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.198
-Lucky.
-Let's see.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:22.161
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:25.107
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:27.007
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:29.706
-Forgot to brush.
-Ohh.

00:06:29.747 --> 00:06:31.738
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:34.182
-Yes.
-Brush.

00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:35.879
-OK, l'm done.
-You missed a spot.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.220
-Where?
-There.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.881
-Where?
-There.

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:40.891
Ha ha! Right there.
And here and here.

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:49.867
All right, we're excited.

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:51.027
All right, we're excited.

00:06:51.068 --> 00:06:52.831
The first day of school.
Here we go.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.838
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:57.272
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

00:06:57.308 --> 00:06:59.742
-lt's not safe.
-That's my boy.

00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:02.041
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.479
We go out...and back in.

00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:06.813
And then we go out...
and back in.

00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:09.877
And then one more time--
out and back in.

00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:11.752
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times--

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:14.155
-Dad...
-All right, come on, boy.

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:19.955
Maybe while l'm at school,
l'll see a shark.

00:07:19.997 --> 00:07:22.659
-l highly doubt that.
-Have you ever met a shark?

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.361
No, and l don't plan to.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.599
-How old are sea turtles?
-l don't know.

00:07:27.638 --> 00:07:29.333
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

00:07:29.373 --> 00:07:32.276
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.710
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:37.009
lf l ever meet a sea turtle,
l'll ask him.

00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:38.982
After l'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:40.585
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.610
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:44.848
Hold my fin.

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.220
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.248
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

00:07:48.292 --> 00:07:51.056
MARLlN:
That snail was about to charge.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.529
Hmm. l wonder where
we're supposed to go.

00:07:53.564 --> 00:07:55.054
ALL: Bye, Mom!

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.192
l'll pick you up after school.

00:07:57.234 --> 00:07:58.929
Ha ha!

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.030
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:05.065
Come on,
we'll try over there.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.469
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

00:08:08.512 --> 00:08:11.037
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:11.782
Yes. Shocking, l know.

00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:12.271
Yes. Shocking, l know.

00:08:12.316 --> 00:08:14.079
-Marty, right?
-Marlin.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.278
-Bob.
-Ted.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.310
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:19.915
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.254
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.193
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

00:08:24.228 --> 00:08:26.753
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:28.788
-Come on, clownie.
-Do something funny.

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:31.301
All right, l know one joke.

00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:35.396
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea--

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:37.498
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:39.406
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

00:08:39.443 --> 00:08:43.004
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:44.514
Well, they--l'm mixed up.

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:47.278
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.319
None of them were walking,
so forget that l--

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:48.876
None of them were walking,
so forget that l--

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:52.150
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

00:08:52.189 --> 00:08:54.555
-Whoa!
-All right, you kids!

00:08:54.592 --> 00:08:57.652
Ooh, where'd you go?

00:08:57.695 --> 00:08:59.856
Dad, can l go play, too?
Can l?

00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:02.889
l would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.439
That's where l would play.

00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:13.509
-What's wrong with his fin?
-He looks funny.

00:09:13.544 --> 00:09:15.910
Ow! Hey, what'd l do?

00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:17.914
Be nice.
lt's his first time at school.

00:09:17.948 --> 00:09:20.644
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:22.946
-Dad...
-See this tentacle?

00:09:22.987 --> 00:09:25.114
lt's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

00:09:25.156 --> 00:09:27.283
but you can't really tell.

00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:29.758
Especially when
l twirl them like this.

00:09:29.794 --> 00:09:31.853
l'm H-2-O intolerant.

00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:33.864
-Ah-choo!
-l'm obnoxious.

00:09:33.898 --> 00:09:35.456

-Come on, Nemo.

ALL: We're under here!

00:09:56.253 --> 00:09:58.118
Oh, there you are.

00:09:58.155 --> 00:09:59.713

¶¶ When you think thoughts

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:06.256
Dad, you can go now.

00:10:06.297 --> 00:10:09.391
-Hello. Who is this?
-l'm Nemo.

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.096
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

00:10:13.137 --> 00:10:15.935
-OK.
-You live in what kind of home?

00:10:15.973 --> 00:10:17.668
An anemon-none.

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.699
A nemenem-menome.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.770
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

00:10:22.813 --> 00:10:24.747
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:26.443
l find if he's having
trouble swimming...

00:10:26.484 --> 00:10:28.452
l let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:30.920
NEMO: Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:33.014
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

00:10:33.057 --> 00:10:35.457
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:38.485
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:40.963
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

00:10:40.998 --> 00:10:41.098
JlMMY: Aw, man!

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.963
JlMMY: Aw, man!

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.025
Bye, Nemo!

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:46.468
Bye, Dad!

00:10:46.504 --> 00:10:48.165
Bye, son!

00:10:50.374 --> 00:10:52.171
Be safe.

00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:54.769
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

00:10:54.812 --> 00:10:57.144
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:59.411
l had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.714
They got to grow up--
The drop off?

00:11:01.752 --> 00:11:04.619
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:07.954
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:09.254
Hey, Marty, calm down.

00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:11.557
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:13.893
Pony boy?

00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:16.798
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.233
Pity.

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:20.133
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:22.731

00:11:24.108 --> 00:11:25.268

00:11:35.386 --> 00:11:36.717
Come on, sing with me.

00:11:36.754 --> 00:11:39.086
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:45.826
Just the girls this time.

00:11:45.863 --> 00:11:47.831

00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:55.963
OK, the drop off.

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.270
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

00:11:58.309 --> 00:11:59.469
but stay close.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.705
Stromalitic
cyanobacteria! Gather.

00:12:03.047 --> 00:12:05.777
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:07.477
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.952
Come on, let's go.

00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:11.352
Come on, sing with me!

00:12:11.388 --> 00:12:13.652
¶¶ There's porifera,
coelenterata ¶¶

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.158

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.820
Hey, guys, wait up!

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.128
Whoa.

00:12:24.768 --> 00:12:26.861
Cool.

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.166
Saved your life!

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:32.539
Aw, you guys made me ink.

00:12:33.978 --> 00:12:35.411
What's that?

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:39.873
TAD: l know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:43.011
He said it was called a butt.

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:44.486
-Whoa.
-Wow.

00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:46.819
That's a pretty big butt.

00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:51.489
Oh, look at me.
l'm going to touch the butt.

00:12:51.528 --> 00:12:53.996
-Ah-choo! Whoa!
-Ha ha ha!

00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:56.829
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

00:12:56.867 --> 00:12:58.494
OK.

00:12:58.535 --> 00:13:01.026
Beat that.

00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:03.596
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:06.109
My dad says it's not safe.

00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:09.078
-Nemo! No!
-Dad?

00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:10.546
You were about
to swim into open water.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.809
No, l wasn't--

00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:13.680
Good thing l was here.
lf l hadn't shown up--

00:13:13.717 --> 00:13:15.981
-He wasn't going to go.
-He was too afraid.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.317
No, l wasn't.

00:13:17.354 --> 00:13:18.787
This does not
concern you, kids...

00:13:18.822 --> 00:13:21.188
and you're lucky
l don't tell your parents.

00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:22.522
You know you can't swim well.

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.493
l can swim fine, Dad, OK?

00:13:24.528 --> 00:13:27.429
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:29.864
OK, l was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.630
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean--

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.137
Clearly, you're not ready...

00:13:33.137 --> 00:13:33.831
Clearly, you're not ready...

00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:35.031
and you're not coming back
until you are.

00:13:35.072 --> 00:13:36.334
You think
you can do these things...

00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:38.273
but you just can't, Nemo!

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.202
l hate you.

00:13:42.413 --> 00:13:45.041
¶¶ There's ¶¶

00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:46.913
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.213
Excuse me.
ls there anything l can do?

00:13:48.252 --> 00:13:50.311
l am a scientist, sir.
ls there any problem?

00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:52.447
l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to interrupt things.

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:55.322
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

00:13:55.359 --> 00:13:57.088
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:58.890
MR. RAY: l can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:01.898
MARLlN: l'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

00:14:01.932 --> 00:14:04.765
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:05.002
l'm not saying
you're not looking.

00:14:05.002 --> 00:14:05.991
l'm not saying
you're not looking.

00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:08.971
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:12.036
Nemo!

00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:15.139
What do you think you're doing?

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:17.977
You'll get stuck out there...

00:14:18.015 --> 00:14:21.507
and l'll have to get you
before another fish does.

00:14:21.618 --> 00:14:23.449
Get back here!

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:26.479
l said get back here now!

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:31.358
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

00:14:31.395 --> 00:14:33.260
Don't you dare!

00:14:33.297 --> 00:14:35.356
lf you put one fin
on that boat...

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:36.889
Are you listening to me?

00:14:36.934 --> 00:14:40.563
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:45.002
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

00:14:45.042 --> 00:14:46.202
That's right.

00:14:46.243 --> 00:14:47.938
You are in big trouble,
young man.

00:14:47.978 --> 00:14:49.775
Do you hear me? Big...

00:14:51.582 --> 00:14:53.550
-Big...
-Aah!

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:56.749
Aah!

00:14:56.787 --> 00:14:58.846
Daddy! Help me!

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:01.858
l'm coming, Nemo!

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.094
-Aah!
-Get under me, kids!

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:06.528
Aah! Oh! No!

00:15:06.563 --> 00:15:08.258
Dad!

00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:10.698
Daddy!

00:15:13.937 --> 00:15:16.804
Oh! Nemo!

00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:21.234
Unh. Nemo!

00:15:21.278 --> 00:15:24.907
Nemo, no! Nemo!

00:15:24.948 --> 00:15:27.917
Nemo! Nemo! No!

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.311
No!

00:15:32.356 --> 00:15:35.257
Aah!

00:15:36.593 --> 00:15:39.619
Uhh.

00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:42.755
Nemo! Nemo!

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.272
Whoa! Hold on.

00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:08.285
Oh, no.

00:16:08.325 --> 00:16:10.919
No. No, it's gone.
lt's gone.

00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:12.258
No, no,
it can't be gone.

00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:14.628
No, no! Nemo!

00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:16.266
Nemo! Nemo!

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.858
Nemo! Nemo!

00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:20.131
No!

00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:22.831
Nemo! Nemo!

00:16:22.873 --> 00:16:25.671
No! No, please, no!

00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:29.673
No, no!

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:33.606
Has anybody seen a boat?

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.481
Please! A white boat!

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.180
They took my son!

00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.723
My son! Help me, please.

00:16:39.723 --> 00:16:41.623
-Look out!
-What?

00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:44.058
Ooh. Ohh.

00:16:44.094 --> 00:16:47.689
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry.
l didn't see you.

00:16:47.731 --> 00:16:51.030
-Sir? Are you OK?
-He's gone, he's gone.

00:16:51.068 --> 00:16:52.501
There, there.
lt's all right.

00:16:52.536 --> 00:16:53.798
-He's gone.
-lt'll be OK.

00:16:53.837 --> 00:16:57.398
No, no. They took him away.
l have to find the boat.

00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:59.500
A boat?
Hey, l've seen a boat.

00:16:59.543 --> 00:17:01.841
-You have?
-lt passed by not too long ago.

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:04.245
-A white one?
-Hi. l'm Dory.

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:05.475
Where? Which way?

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:07.677
Oh, oh, oh.
lt went this way.

00:17:07.718 --> 00:17:09.117
lt went this way.
Follow me.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:12.520
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

00:17:12.556 --> 00:17:13.682
No problem.

00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:40.274
MARLlN: Hey...

00:17:40.317 --> 00:17:41.716
Wait!

00:17:47.824 --> 00:17:49.917
-Will you quit it?
-What?

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.724
l'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

00:17:52.763 --> 00:17:53.096
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

00:17:53.096 --> 00:17:54.961
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

00:17:54.998 --> 00:17:57.694
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

00:17:57.734 --> 00:17:59.599
Ooh, l'm scared now. What?

00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:02.230
-Wait a minute.
-Stop following me, OK?

00:18:02.272 --> 00:18:05.400
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

00:18:05.442 --> 00:18:07.044
A boat?
Hey, l've seen a boat.

00:18:07.277 --> 00:18:10.474
lt passed by not too long ago.
lt went this way.

00:18:10.514 --> 00:18:11.913
lt went this way.
Follow me.

00:18:11.949 --> 00:18:14.076
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

00:18:14.117 --> 00:18:16.415
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

00:18:16.453 --> 00:18:19.650
l did? Oh, no.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.988
lf this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

00:18:22.025 --> 00:18:24.323
And l know funny.
l'm a clownfish.

00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:27.762
No, it's not. l know it's not.
l'm so sorry.

00:18:27.798 --> 00:18:30.767
See, l suffer from
short-term memory loss.

00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:34.635
Short-term memory loss.
l don't believe this.

00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:36.536
No, it's true. l forget things
almost instantly.

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:40.532
lt runs in my family.
At least, l think it does.

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:44.604
Um, hmm. Where are they?

00:18:49.353 --> 00:18:50.787
Can l help you?

00:18:50.787 --> 00:18:53.449
Something's wrong
with you--really.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.355
You're wasting my time.

00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:57.451
l have to find my son.

00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:02.255
Hello.

00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:04.290
-Ohh.
-Well, hi!

00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:07.360
Name's Bruce.

00:19:07.404 --> 00:19:09.167
lt's all right.
l understand.

00:19:09.206 --> 00:19:12.937
Why trust a shark, right?

00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:23.111
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

00:19:23.153 --> 00:19:24.814
doing out so late, eh?

00:19:24.855 --> 00:19:26.880
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

00:19:26.923 --> 00:19:29.153
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

00:19:29.192 --> 00:19:32.457
like to come to a little
get-together l'm having?

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:33.690
You mean, like a party?

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.791
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:39.995
l love parties.
That sounds like fun.

00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:42.437
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but--

00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:46.374
Oh, come on, l insist.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.607
MARLlN: OK.
That's all that matters.

00:19:52.249 --> 00:19:54.410
DORY: Hey, look, balloons.
lt is a party.

00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:56.783
BRUCE: Ha ha ha ha!
Mind your distance, though.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.482
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

00:19:59.523 --> 00:20:01.821
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:12.300
MARLlN: Oh.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.764
Ohh.

00:20:15.772 --> 00:20:18.400
Anchor! Chum!

00:20:18.442 --> 00:20:21.240
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

00:20:21.278 --> 00:20:23.940
-We got company.
-lt's about time, mate.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.848
We've already gone
through the snacks...

00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:25.439
We've already gone
through the snacks...

00:20:25.482 --> 00:20:27.040
and l'm still starving.

00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:29.279
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:31.048
Come on,
let's get this over with.

00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:33.881
BRUCE: Right, then.

00:20:33.924 --> 00:20:36.222
The meeting has officially
come to order.

00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:37.749
Let us all say the pledge.

00:20:37.794 --> 00:20:42.288
l am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

00:20:42.332 --> 00:20:44.960
lf l am to change this image...

00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:47.435
l must first change myself.

00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:50.201
Fish are friends, not food.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.571
Except stinkin' dolphins.

00:20:51.608 --> 00:20:54.634
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

00:20:54.678 --> 00:20:56.407
''Look at me.
l'm a flippin' little dolphin.

00:20:56.446 --> 00:20:58.107
''Let me flip for you.
Ain't l something?''

00:20:58.148 --> 00:21:00.742
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5--

00:21:00.784 --> 00:21:02.445
Bring a Fish Friend.

00:21:02.486 --> 00:21:03.976
Do you all have your friends?

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.180
Got mine.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.183
-Hey, there.
-How about you, Chum?

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:13.754
Oh, l...seem to have
misplaced my friend.

00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:16.730
BRUCE: That's all right, Chum.

00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:18.291
l had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

00:21:18.335 --> 00:21:19.859
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:23.361
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.068
BRUCE: l'll start
the testimonies.

00:21:25.108 --> 00:21:27.338
Hello. My name is Bruce.

00:21:27.377 --> 00:21:28.639
BOTH: Hello, Bruce.

00:21:28.678 --> 00:21:30.839
lt has been three weeks
since my last fish.

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:34.317
On my honor, or may l be
chopped up and made into soup.

00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:37.115
-You're an inspiration!
-Amen.

00:21:38.355 --> 00:21:39.788
Right, then. Who's next?

00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:41.120
DORY: Pick me, pick me.

00:21:41.158 --> 00:21:43.023
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:45.118
-Whoo!
-Come on up here.

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.961
Hi. l'm Dory.

00:21:47.998 --> 00:21:50.398
-Hello, Dory.
-And, uh, well...

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:53.597
l don't think
l've ever eaten a fish.

00:21:53.637 --> 00:21:57.198
-That's incredible.
-Good on you, mate.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.265
l'm glad
l got that off my chest.

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:00.640
All right, anyone else?

00:22:00.677 --> 00:22:03.271
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

00:22:03.313 --> 00:22:05.543
MARLlN: Me?
l don't have a problem.

00:22:05.582 --> 00:22:06.947
Oh, OK.

00:22:06.983 --> 00:22:08.575
-Denial.
-Aah!

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:10.449
BRUCE: Just start
with your name.

00:22:10.487 --> 00:22:13.183
OK. Uh, hello.

00:22:13.223 --> 00:22:16.317
My name is Marlin.
l'm a clownfish.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:19.385
-A clownfish? Really?
-Tell us a joke.

00:22:19.429 --> 00:22:21.158
l love jokes.

00:22:21.198 --> 00:22:24.190
l actually do know one
that's pretty good.

00:22:24.234 --> 00:22:26.259
There was this mollusk...

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.635
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

00:22:28.672 --> 00:22:30.503
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.508
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:35.602
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:39.908
NEMO: Daddy!

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.281
Nemo!

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:44.344
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo!
l don't get it.

00:22:44.387 --> 00:22:46.287
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.154
No, no, no, no.
He's my son.

00:22:48.191 --> 00:22:50.250
He was taken by these divers.

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:54.997
Humans--think they own
everything.

00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:56.293
Probably American.

00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:57.334
Now, there is a father--
Looking for his little boy.

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:00.462
Now, there is a father--
Looking for his little boy.

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.995
MARLlN: What do
these markings mean?

00:23:05.408 --> 00:23:07.808
-Group hug.
-We're all mates here, mate.

00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:09.072
l can't read human.

00:23:09.112 --> 00:23:10.374
DORY: We got to find a fish
that can read this.

00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:12.381
-Hey, look, sharks.
-No, no, no, Dory!

00:23:12.415 --> 00:23:14.542
-Guys, guys.
-No, Dory.

00:23:14.584 --> 00:23:15.915
That's mine.
Give it to me.

00:23:15.952 --> 00:23:17.419
Gimme! Ow!

00:23:17.454 --> 00:23:19.422
Oh, l'm sorry.
Are you OK?

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:20.854
-Ow, ow, ow.
-l'm so sorry.

00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:23.018
You really clocked me there.
Am l bleeding?

00:23:23.059 --> 00:23:24.959
-Ohh.
-Ow, ow, ow.

00:23:24.995 --> 00:23:28.556
Dory, are you OK--Ohh.

00:23:28.598 --> 00:23:29.399
Ohh, that's good.

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:32.129
Ohh, that's good.

00:23:32.168 --> 00:23:34.068
BOTH: lntervention!

00:23:34.104 --> 00:23:36.698
-Just a bite.
-Hold it together, mate!

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.368
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:41.511
-Food!
-Dory, look out!

00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:42.307
-Food!
-Dory, look out!

00:23:42.345 --> 00:23:45.906
-Aah!
-l'm having fish tonight!

00:23:45.949 --> 00:23:47.541
Remember the steps, mate!

00:23:47.584 --> 00:23:50.109
MARLlN: Aah!

00:23:50.153 --> 00:23:53.316
-Aah! Whoa!
-Aah!

00:23:53.356 --> 00:23:55.620
-Just one bite!
-Aah!

00:23:58.695 --> 00:24:02.461
G'day. Grr!

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.762
There's no way out!

00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:06.564
There's got to be a way
to escape!

00:24:08.772 --> 00:24:10.106
Who is it?

00:24:10.106 --> 00:24:11.471
Dory, help me
find a way out!

00:24:11.508 --> 00:24:14.033
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

00:24:15.278 --> 00:24:18.645
-There's got to be a way out!
-Here's something.

00:24:18.682 --> 00:24:21.412
''Es-cap-e.''
l wonder what that means.

00:24:21.451 --> 00:24:22.975
Funny. lt's spelled
just like ''escape.''

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:24.281
-Let's go.
-Aah!

00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:27.415
Here's Brucey!

00:24:27.457 --> 00:24:29.152
Wait a minute.
You can read?

00:24:29.192 --> 00:24:31.183
l can read?
That's right. l can read!

00:24:31.227 --> 00:24:33.354
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

00:24:33.396 --> 00:24:35.364
-Aah!
-Ohh!

00:24:35.398 --> 00:24:38.162
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:39.429
CHUM:
Don't fall off the wagon!

00:24:39.469 --> 00:24:41.027
-Aah!
-Aah!

00:24:43.506 --> 00:24:45.942
Oh, no, it's blocked!

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.477
No, Bruce, focus.

00:24:51.514 --> 00:24:53.641
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

00:24:53.683 --> 00:24:56.345
He's really a nice guy.

00:24:56.386 --> 00:24:57.614
l need to get that mask.

00:24:57.654 --> 00:24:59.246
You want that mask? OK.

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:02.053
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:25:02.092 --> 00:25:04.617
Quick, grab the mask!

00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:11.331
Oh, no. Bruce?

00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:12.995
What?

00:25:17.607 --> 00:25:19.336
DORY:
Aw, is the party over?

00:25:28.685 --> 00:25:30.619
Nice.

00:25:33.714 --> 00:25:34.874
Dad?

00:25:37.718 --> 00:25:38.912
Daddy?

00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:42.349
Huh?

00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:46.717
Aah! Uhh!

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.424
Uhh!

00:26:01.775 --> 00:26:03.709
-Barbara.
-Uh-huh?

00:26:03.744 --> 00:26:05.575
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

00:26:05.613 --> 00:26:08.047
And l'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

00:26:08.082 --> 00:26:09.709
BARBARA: OK.

00:26:11.452 --> 00:26:13.181
Hello, little fella.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.414
Aah!

00:26:14.455 --> 00:26:15.615
Heh heh heh!
Beauty, isn't he?

00:26:15.656 --> 00:26:16.987
l found that guy
struggling for life...

00:26:17.024 --> 00:26:18.719
out on the reef,
and l saved him.

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:20.852
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:24.092
PATlENT: l think so.
We're ready to roll.

00:26:25.332 --> 00:26:26.856
Bubbles!

00:26:29.837 --> 00:26:31.429
My bubbles.

00:26:31.472 --> 00:26:32.837
He likes bubbles.

00:26:32.873 --> 00:26:36.570
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

00:26:44.351 --> 00:26:45.579
-Bonjour.
-Aah!

00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:49.419
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

00:26:49.456 --> 00:26:52.687
-He's scared to death.
-l want to go home.

00:26:52.726 --> 00:26:54.751
Do you know where my dad is?

00:26:54.795 --> 00:26:57.559
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

00:26:57.598 --> 00:26:58.758
Pet store?

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.495
Yeah, you know, like,
l'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

00:27:01.535 --> 00:27:03.093
-Pet Palace.
-Fish-O-Rama.

00:27:03.137 --> 00:27:04.604
-Mail order.
-Ebay.

00:27:04.638 --> 00:27:07.334
-So, which one is it?
-l'm from the ocean.

00:27:07.374 --> 00:27:09.308
Ah, the ocean. The ocean?

00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:11.243
Aah! Aah! Aah!

00:27:11.278 --> 00:27:13.974
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

00:27:14.014 --> 00:27:15.345
-Oui.
-Clean him!

00:27:15.382 --> 00:27:16.906
Oui.

00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:19.385
-Ocean.
-Ooh, la mer. Bon.

00:27:21.221 --> 00:27:23.348
Voila. He is clean.

00:27:25.826 --> 00:27:29.091
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

00:27:29.129 --> 00:27:33.156
-Big and blue?
-l knew it.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.397
lf there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

00:27:36.437 --> 00:27:39.531
Or if l'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

00:27:39.573 --> 00:27:41.336
Hi. How are you?

00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.899
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

00:27:42.943 --> 00:27:44.774
She's nuts.
Ha ha ha ha!

00:27:44.812 --> 00:27:45.904
We got a live one.

00:27:45.946 --> 00:27:48.972
-Can't hear you, Peach.
-l said we got a live one.

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:50.984
-Boy, oh, boy.
-What do we got?

00:27:51.018 --> 00:27:52.542
Root canal--and by the looks
of those x-rays...

00:27:52.586 --> 00:27:54.053
it's not going to be pretty.

00:27:54.088 --> 00:27:55.783
Ow!

00:27:55.823 --> 00:27:57.256
-Dam and clamp installed?
-Yep.

00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:59.088
-What did he use to open?
-Gator-Glidden drill.

00:27:59.126 --> 00:28:00.787
He seems to favor
that one lately.

00:28:00.828 --> 00:28:03.763
l can't see, Flo.

00:28:03.797 --> 00:28:05.924
You're getting
a little too--Aah!

00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:07.160
PEACH: Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.600
BLOAT: He's using
a Hedstrom file.

00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:10.831
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

00:28:10.871 --> 00:28:13.499
lt has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.030
-No, no, K-Flex.
-Hedstrom.

00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:16.770
-K-Flex!
-Hedstrom!

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.869
There l go.
A little help, over here.

00:28:18.979 --> 00:28:20.776
DEB: l'll go deflate him.

00:28:23.217 --> 00:28:25.378
DENTlST: All right.
Go ahead and rinse.

00:28:25.419 --> 00:28:28.752
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

00:28:31.191 --> 00:28:33.125
-Hey, Nigel.
-What did l miss?

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.320
PEACH: Root canal--a doozy.

00:28:34.361 --> 00:28:35.988
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.055
-Gator-Glidden drill.
-He's favoring that one.

00:28:38.098 --> 00:28:41.090
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

00:28:41.135 --> 00:28:44.229
-Hello. Who's this?
-New guy. Ha ha ha!

00:28:44.271 --> 00:28:45.602
The dentist
took him off the reef.

00:28:45.639 --> 00:28:48.005
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

00:28:48.042 --> 00:28:49.532
Sorry if l ever took
a snap at you.

00:28:49.576 --> 00:28:50.975
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

00:28:51.011 --> 00:28:52.706
Hey! No, no, no, no!

00:28:52.746 --> 00:28:54.338
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

00:28:54.381 --> 00:28:57.179
Come on, go.
Go on, shoo!

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:00.180
Aw, the picture broke.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.279
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

00:29:02.322 --> 00:29:03.789
She's going to be
eight this week.

00:29:03.824 --> 00:29:05.291
Hey, little fella.

00:29:05.325 --> 00:29:07.088
Say hello
to your new mummy.

00:29:07.127 --> 00:29:09.595
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.461
You're her present.
Shh, shh, shh.

00:29:11.498 --> 00:29:13.557
lt's our little secret.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.124
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:17.137
l'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

00:29:18.972 --> 00:29:20.872
Oh, Darla.

00:29:20.908 --> 00:29:22.773
What?
What's wrong with her?

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.506
GURGLE: She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:29.312
-Poor Chuckles.
-He was her present last year.

00:29:29.349 --> 00:29:31.715
BLOAT: Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:35.782
PEACH: She's a fish killer.

00:29:35.823 --> 00:29:38.087
l can't go with that girl.

00:29:38.125 --> 00:29:39.888
l have to get back
to my dad.

00:29:39.927 --> 00:29:43.829
Aah! Daddy! Help me!

00:29:43.864 --> 00:29:45.024
Oh, he's stuck.

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:47.260
GlLL: Nobody touch him.

00:29:49.536 --> 00:29:51.504
Nobody touch him.

00:29:57.244 --> 00:29:58.677
Can you help me?

00:29:58.712 --> 00:29:59.079
No. You got yourself
in there.

00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:00.706
No. You got yourself
in there.

00:30:00.748 --> 00:30:02.409
You can get yourself out.

00:30:02.449 --> 00:30:04.713
-Gill--
-l want to see him do it.

00:30:04.752 --> 00:30:08.586
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

00:30:08.622 --> 00:30:11.420
l can't. l have a bad fin.

00:30:11.458 --> 00:30:13.619
Never stopped me.

00:30:17.698 --> 00:30:20.258
Just think about
what you need to do.

00:30:24.238 --> 00:30:25.762
Come on.

00:30:29.977 --> 00:30:31.171
Perfect.

00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:32.576
-Yay!
-You did it!

00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:34.376
Good squirming.
Ha ha ha!

00:30:34.414 --> 00:30:38.009
Wow. From the ocean--
just like you, Gill.

00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:39.211
Yeah.

00:30:41.655 --> 00:30:43.316
What are you thinking about?

00:30:43.357 --> 00:30:45.120
l'm thinking...

00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:48.720
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

00:30:48.762 --> 00:30:50.423
So, kid,

00:30:50.464 --> 00:30:53.160
Nemo. l'm Nemo.

00:30:55.302 --> 00:30:57.770
Nemo. Nemo.

00:31:02.976 --> 00:31:04.671
DORY: Are you gonna eat that?

00:31:16.223 --> 00:31:19.886
-Careful with that hammer.
-Huh?

00:31:22.396 --> 00:31:25.160
No, no.

00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:27.429
What does it say? Dory!

00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:29.094
DORY:
A sea monkey has my money.

00:31:29.136 --> 00:31:31.400
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

00:31:31.438 --> 00:31:32.405
Come on!

00:31:32.439 --> 00:31:34.669

DORY: Wow. Dusty.

00:32:02.135 --> 00:32:03.659
The mask.
Where's the mask?

00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:07.239
No! No, not the mask!

00:32:07.274 --> 00:32:09.799
Get it! Get the mask!

-Did you drop it?
-You dropped it!

00:32:28.395 --> 00:32:29.987
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.328
Now it's gone.

00:32:34.935 --> 00:32:38.803

-Sorry.

00:33:03.163 --> 00:33:04.596

MARLlN: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:18.677

DORY: Haah!

00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:26.379
-The mask!
-What mask?

00:34:26.413 --> 00:34:28.711
OK, l can't see a thing.

00:34:30.117 --> 00:34:32.415

DORY: l'm sorry,

Oh. The first line's
''P. Sherman.''

00:34:56.943 --> 00:34:59.138
''P. Sherman''
doesn't make any sense!

00:34:59.179 --> 00:35:01.409
DORY: OK. Second line. ''42.''

00:35:01.448 --> 00:35:03.416

DORY: The second line's
''42 Wallaby Way.''

00:35:15.462 --> 00:35:18.260
MARLlN: That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

00:35:18.298 --> 00:35:19.925
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

00:35:19.966 --> 00:35:22.491
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

00:35:22.536 --> 00:35:25.630
-''Sydney''! lt's ''Sydney''!
-Duck!

00:35:25.672 --> 00:35:27.606

Nemo.

00:37:51.785 --> 00:37:54.117
Brother Bloat, proceed.

00:37:55.255 --> 00:37:59.157
Nemo, newcomer
of orange and white...

00:37:59.192 --> 00:38:00.557
you have been called forth...

00:38:00.594 --> 00:38:03.154
to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie...

00:38:03.196 --> 00:38:08.498
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:11.436
-Huh?
-We want you in our club, kid.

00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:12.665
-Really?
-lf...

00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:15.971
you are able to swim through...

00:38:23.984 --> 00:38:25.815
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

00:38:25.852 --> 00:38:27.479
You said you could do it.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.112
The Ring of Fire!

00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:33.618

lsn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

00:38:54.681 --> 00:38:59.778
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

00:38:59.819 --> 00:39:01.150
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

00:39:01.187 --> 00:39:02.950
Welcome,
Brother Sharkbait.

00:39:02.989 --> 00:39:04.217
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

00:39:04.257 --> 00:39:06.282
-Enough with the Sharkbait.
-Sharkbait!

00:39:06.326 --> 00:39:08.191
Ooh...ba-ba-do.

00:39:08.228 --> 00:39:09.786
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:11.888
-Agreed.
-We can't send him to his death.

00:39:11.931 --> 00:39:14.024
Darla's coming in five days.

00:39:14.067 --> 00:39:15.625
So, what are we going to do?

00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:18.229
l'll tell you
what we're gonna do--

00:39:18.271 --> 00:39:19.829
we're gonna get him
out of here.

00:39:19.873 --> 00:39:22.398
-We'll help him escape.
-Escape? Really?

00:39:22.442 --> 00:39:23.909
We're all gonna escape.

00:39:23.943 --> 00:39:26.571
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

00:39:26.613 --> 00:39:28.638
Sorry,
but they just never work.

00:39:28.682 --> 00:39:29.816
Why should this
be any different?

00:39:29.816 --> 00:39:30.214
Why should this
be any different?

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.708
-Because we've got him.
-Me?

00:39:33.753 --> 00:39:35.522
-You see that filter?
-Yeah.

00:39:35.522 --> 00:39:38.958
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

00:39:38.992 --> 00:39:42.155
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

00:39:42.195 --> 00:39:43.423
and jam the gears.

00:39:43.463 --> 00:39:45.431
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:47.433
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

00:39:47.467 --> 00:39:49.799
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

00:39:49.836 --> 00:39:52.737
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

00:39:52.772 --> 00:39:54.330
put us in
individual baggies...

00:39:54.374 --> 00:39:56.171
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

00:39:56.209 --> 00:39:57.870
out the window,
off the awning...

00:39:57.911 --> 00:39:59.572
into the bushes,
across the street...

00:39:59.612 --> 00:40:02.080
and into the harbor!

00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:05.050
lt's foolproof.
Who's with me?

00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:06.484
-Aye!
-Aye!

00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:07.952
l think you're nuts.

00:40:09.122 --> 00:40:11.955
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:14.391
He's fine. He can do this.

00:40:14.427 --> 00:40:17.885
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

00:40:17.931 --> 00:40:22.869
Let's do it.

00:40:22.869 --> 00:40:25.838
DORY: l'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

00:40:25.872 --> 00:40:27.169
Where are you going?

00:40:27.207 --> 00:40:28.868
l'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

00:40:28.908 --> 00:40:30.535
lf you ask
where l'm going...

00:40:30.577 --> 00:40:32.306
l'll tell you
that's where l'm going.

00:40:32.345 --> 00:40:33.812
lt's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

00:40:33.847 --> 00:40:35.610
Where? l'm sorry,
l didn't hear you.

00:40:35.648 --> 00:40:37.206
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.048
MARLlN: Excuse me.

00:40:40.086 --> 00:40:41.883
Hi.
Do you know how to get--

00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:44.890
Hello? Whoa. Wait.
Can you tell me--

00:40:44.924 --> 00:40:49.258
Hey! Hold it!
l'm trying to talk to you!

00:40:49.295 --> 00:40:52.662
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

00:40:52.699 --> 00:40:57.102
l need to--
And they're gone again.

00:40:57.137 --> 00:40:58.900
DORY: P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

00:40:58.938 --> 00:41:00.599
Why do l have to tell you
over and over again?

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.631
l'll tell you again.
l don't get tired of it--

00:41:02.675 --> 00:41:03.835
-OK, all right.
-Huh?

00:41:03.877 --> 00:41:05.572
-Here's the thing.
-Uh-huh.

00:41:05.612 --> 00:41:11.107
l think it's best
if l carry on from here by...

00:41:11.151 --> 00:41:12.516
by myself.

00:41:12.552 --> 00:41:13.746
OK.

00:41:13.787 --> 00:41:15.482
-You know, alone.
-Uh-huh.

00:41:15.522 --> 00:41:17.547
Without--without--
l mean, not without you.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.957
But l don't
want you...with me.

00:41:20.994 --> 00:41:23.326
-Huh?
-Am l...

00:41:23.363 --> 00:41:24.523
l don't want to hurt
your feelings.

00:41:24.564 --> 00:41:27.362
-You want me to leave?
-l mean, not--Yes.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.834
l just can't afford
any more delays...

00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:33.066
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

00:41:33.106 --> 00:41:34.733
Sometimes it's a good thing.

00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:37.800
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

00:41:37.844 --> 00:41:39.402
You mean...

00:41:39.446 --> 00:41:41.107
You mean you don't like me?

00:41:41.147 --> 00:41:42.944
No, of course l like you.

00:41:42.982 --> 00:41:45.678
lt's because l like you
l don't want to be with you.

00:41:45.718 --> 00:41:47.879
lt's a complicated emotion.

00:41:47.921 --> 00:41:51.618
-Ohh!
-Don't cry. l like you.

00:41:51.658 --> 00:41:56.027
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

00:41:56.062 --> 00:41:57.996
Um...l don't remember.
Were you?

00:41:58.031 --> 00:41:59.931
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just--

00:41:59.966 --> 00:42:01.729
Do you guys know
how l can get to--

00:42:01.768 --> 00:42:04.100
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:05.729
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

00:42:05.772 --> 00:42:07.797
Mm-hmm.

00:42:07.841 --> 00:42:10.173
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.768
So what are we?
Take a guess.

00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:13.108
DORY: Oh, oh.
l've seen one of those.

00:42:13.146 --> 00:42:15.341
l'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:17.349
-Wait, wait, um--
-lt's a swordfish!

00:42:17.383 --> 00:42:19.152
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

00:42:19.152 --> 00:42:20.414
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

00:42:20.453 --> 00:42:22.011
Where's the butter?

00:42:22.055 --> 00:42:23.454
Ooh! lt's on
the tip of my tongue!

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.481
-Lobster.
-Saw that!

00:42:25.525 --> 00:42:27.356
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

00:42:27.393 --> 00:42:28.792
-Clam!
-Close enough!

00:42:28.828 --> 00:42:30.318
¶¶ Oh, it's a whale
of a tale ¶¶

00:42:30.363 --> 00:42:31.830
¶¶ l'll tell you, lad... ¶¶

00:42:31.865 --> 00:42:32.854
They're good.

00:42:32.899 --> 00:42:34.196
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

00:42:34.234 --> 00:42:36.600
''Will somebody please
give me directions?!''

00:42:36.636 --> 00:42:38.661
-Ha ha ha ha ha!
-l'm serious!

00:42:38.705 --> 00:42:40.696
''Blah blah blah,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.934
''Blah blah blah,
me, me, me!''

00:42:41.975 --> 00:42:43.465
Thank you.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.001
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

00:42:46.045 --> 00:42:48.181
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

00:42:48.181 --> 00:42:48.704
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

00:42:48.748 --> 00:42:50.716
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.880
l am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:56.218
l bet that's frustrating.

00:42:56.256 --> 00:42:57.689
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

00:42:57.724 --> 00:42:59.715
-Your son Chico?
-Nemo?

00:42:59.759 --> 00:43:01.158
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

00:43:01.194 --> 00:43:03.162
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

00:43:03.196 --> 00:43:06.962
Well, l'm helping you.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.331
Wait right here.

00:43:09.569 --> 00:43:12.163
-Guys!
-ls he bothering you again?

00:43:12.205 --> 00:43:13.729
No, no. He's a good guy.

00:43:13.773 --> 00:43:14.774
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

00:43:14.774 --> 00:43:16.002
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

00:43:16.042 --> 00:43:18.909
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

00:43:19.012 --> 00:43:21.640
Sydney? Oh, sure!

00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:23.410
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:25.076
-Don't you, Ted?
-Sure do!

00:43:25.118 --> 00:43:26.608
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

00:43:27.854 --> 00:43:29.344
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:31.357
You want to follow the E.A.C.

00:43:31.391 --> 00:43:34.087
That's the East
Australian Current.

00:43:34.127 --> 00:43:35.754
Big current.
Can't miss it.

00:43:35.795 --> 00:43:38.764
lt's in...that direction.

00:43:38.798 --> 00:43:40.698
And then you follow that
for about...

00:43:40.733 --> 00:43:42.496
l don't know.
What do you guys think?

00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:43.695
About three leagues?

00:43:43.736 --> 00:43:46.705
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

00:43:46.739 --> 00:43:49.173
-Ta-da!
-That's great!

00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:50.402
Dory, you did it!

00:43:50.443 --> 00:43:52.274
Oh, please,
l'm just your little helper.

00:43:52.312 --> 00:43:54.644
-Helping along. That's me.
-Fellas, thank you.

00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:58.310
LEADER: Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

00:43:58.351 --> 00:44:01.343
DORY: Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

00:44:01.387 --> 00:44:03.218
LEADER: Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

00:44:03.256 --> 00:44:06.817
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

00:44:06.859 --> 00:44:08.759
DORY: Trench...
through it, not over it.

00:44:08.795 --> 00:44:11.491
l'll remember. Hey, hey!

00:44:12.932 --> 00:44:15.196
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

00:44:15.234 --> 00:44:17.964
Wait, wait, wait!
l gotta tell you something.

00:44:18.004 --> 00:44:20.700
Whoa.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.038
DORY: Nice trench.

00:44:24.777 --> 00:44:27.769
Hello!

00:44:30.483 --> 00:44:33.111
-OK, let's go.
-No, no. Bad trench.

00:44:33.152 --> 00:44:34.813
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

00:44:34.854 --> 00:44:36.981
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

00:44:37.023 --> 00:44:40.652
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

00:44:40.693 --> 00:44:42.320
Are you looking at this thing?

00:44:42.362 --> 00:44:43.852
lt's got death
written all over it.

00:44:43.896 --> 00:44:46.729
l really, really, really
think we should swim through.

00:44:46.766 --> 00:44:48.996
And l'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

00:44:49.035 --> 00:44:51.003
-Trust me on this.
-Trust you?

00:44:51.037 --> 00:44:52.902
Yes, trust.
lt's what friends do.

00:44:52.939 --> 00:44:54.839
Look! Something shiny!

00:44:54.874 --> 00:44:56.637
-Where?
-lt just swam over the trench.

00:44:56.676 --> 00:45:02.382
-Come on, we'll follow it!
-OK!

00:45:02.382 --> 00:45:05.044
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

00:45:05.084 --> 00:45:08.542
Exactly. And look at that--
there's the current.

00:45:08.588 --> 00:45:11.182
We should be there in no time.

00:45:11.224 --> 00:45:13.021
Hey, little guy.

00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:14.822
You wanted to go
through the trench.

00:45:14.861 --> 00:45:16.886
l shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

00:45:16.929 --> 00:45:19.090
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

00:45:19.198 --> 00:45:20.631
Come here, little Squishy.

00:45:22.435 --> 00:45:23.663
Ow!

00:45:23.703 --> 00:45:26.570
-That's a jellyfish!
-Bad Squishy!

00:45:26.606 --> 00:45:28.403
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:30.739
-Let me see that.
-Don't touch it.

00:45:30.777 --> 00:45:33.109
l won't touch it.
l just want to look.

00:45:33.146 --> 00:45:35.171
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

00:45:35.214 --> 00:45:36.738
lt did.
lt's just that--

00:45:36.783 --> 00:45:38.478
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-Hold still.

00:45:38.518 --> 00:45:39.985
l live in this anemone...

00:45:40.019 --> 00:45:41.884
and l'm used
to these kind of stings.

00:45:41.921 --> 00:45:43.081
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:45:43.122 --> 00:45:45.113
lt doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

00:45:45.158 --> 00:45:46.887
But now we know, don't we...

00:45:46.926 --> 00:45:49.121
that we don't want
to touch these again.

00:45:49.162 --> 00:45:52.188
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:54.631
-Aah!
-Aah!

00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:55.929
Don't move.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:58.571
-This is bad, Dory.
-Hey, watch this!

00:45:58.571 --> 00:46:00.664
-This is bad, Dory.
-Hey, watch this!

00:46:00.707 --> 00:46:02.368
Boing! Boing!

00:46:02.408 --> 00:46:03.636
Dory!

00:46:03.676 --> 00:46:06.008
¶¶ You can't catch me ¶¶

00:46:06.045 --> 00:46:07.512
Don't bounce on the tops!

00:46:07.547 --> 00:46:10.675
They will...not sting you!

00:46:10.717 --> 00:46:13.379
-The tops don't sting you!
-Two in a row! Beat that!

00:46:13.419 --> 00:46:16.354
Dory, listen to me.
l have an idea--a game.

00:46:16.389 --> 00:46:17.856
-A game?
-Yes.

00:46:17.957 --> 00:46:20.619
-l love games! Pick me!
-Here's the game.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:24.118
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

00:46:24.163 --> 00:46:25.790
-OK.
-Rules, rules, rules!

00:46:25.832 --> 00:46:28.392
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

00:46:28.434 --> 00:46:30.299
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

00:46:30.336 --> 00:46:33.271
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

00:46:33.306 --> 00:46:34.500
-Whee!
-Wait, Dory!

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.241
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

00:46:35.241 --> 00:46:36.640
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

00:46:36.676 --> 00:46:37.836
Whoa! Dory!

00:46:37.877 --> 00:46:39.845
Boing, boing, boing!

00:46:39.879 --> 00:46:42.746
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

00:46:42.782 --> 00:46:44.306
Whee!

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.615
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

00:46:47.653 --> 00:46:49.314
But we're having fun
at the same time.

00:46:49.355 --> 00:46:50.788
l can do this.
Just be careful.

00:46:50.823 --> 00:46:52.723
Yeah, careful l don't
make you cry when l win!

00:46:52.759 --> 00:46:53.919
l don't think so!

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.484
Ha ha ha ha!

00:46:55.528 --> 00:46:57.325
Whoa!

00:46:57.363 --> 00:46:58.523
Give it up, old man.

00:46:58.564 --> 00:47:00.828
You can't fight evolution.
l was built for speed.

00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:02.835
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:04.200
-Hungry?
-Yeah.

00:47:04.237 --> 00:47:06.967
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

00:47:07.006 --> 00:47:09.167
Duck to the left!
Right there!

00:47:11.544 --> 00:47:13.978
The clownfish is the winner!

00:47:14.013 --> 00:47:17.073
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Look at us!

00:47:17.116 --> 00:47:18.643
Dory?

00:47:20.878 --> 00:47:22.277
Oh, no.

00:47:23.347 --> 00:47:25.645
Dory! Dory!

00:47:25.683 --> 00:47:27.776
Dory!

00:47:29.754 --> 00:47:31.984
Dory!

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.890
DORY: Am l disqualified?

00:47:38.929 --> 00:47:40.897
MARLlN: No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:44.059
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

00:47:44.101 --> 00:47:47.002
DORY: P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

00:47:47.038 --> 00:47:48.801
MARLlN: That's it!

00:47:48.839 --> 00:47:49.999
Uhh!

00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:52.737
-Wallaby Way...
-Uhh! Stay awake!

00:47:52.777 --> 00:47:55.075
Stay awake!
Ooh! Stay awake!

00:47:55.112 --> 00:47:58.878
Stay...awake!

00:48:01.419 --> 00:48:04.684
-Awake.
-P. Sherman.

00:48:04.722 --> 00:48:07.714
-Awake.
-42 Wallaby Way.

00:48:07.758 --> 00:48:11.328
Wake up. Nemo...

00:48:11.328 --> 00:48:11.726
Wake up. Nemo...

00:48:26.444 --> 00:48:28.810
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

00:48:28.846 --> 00:48:29.714
Yeah.

00:48:29.714 --> 00:48:30.203
Yeah.

00:48:30.247 --> 00:48:34.240
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

00:48:34.285 --> 00:48:36.446
He's not looking for me.

00:48:36.487 --> 00:48:39.854
He's scared of the ocean.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.448
Peach, any movement?

00:48:41.525 --> 00:48:44.426
He's had four cups of coffee.
lt's gotta be soon.

00:48:44.462 --> 00:48:45.986
Keep on him.

00:48:48.399 --> 00:48:51.232
My first escape--
landed on dental tools.

00:48:51.268 --> 00:48:52.701
l was aiming for the toilet.

00:48:52.737 --> 00:48:53.931
Toilet?

00:48:53.971 --> 00:48:56.565
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

00:48:56.607 --> 00:48:59.872
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.502
Ah, l've lost count.

00:49:01.545 --> 00:49:03.479
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

00:49:03.514 --> 00:49:05.175
lt does things to you.

00:49:07.384 --> 00:49:09.750
Potty break! He grabbed
the ''Reader's Digest.''

00:49:09.787 --> 00:49:13.188
-We have 4.2 minutes!
-That's your cue, Sharkbait.

00:49:13.224 --> 00:49:15.522
-You can do it, kid.
-We gotta be quick.

00:49:15.559 --> 00:49:15.760
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.194
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

00:49:18.229 --> 00:49:19.992
and l'll talk you
through the rest.

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.828
-OK.
-lt'll be a piece of kelp.

00:49:31.275 --> 00:49:32.640
Nicely done!

00:49:32.676 --> 00:49:34.405
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah!

00:49:34.445 --> 00:49:36.936
Here comes the pebble.

00:49:38.215 --> 00:49:39.409
Ptoo.

00:49:41.886 --> 00:49:44.684
Now, do you see
a small opening?

00:49:44.722 --> 00:49:46.155
Uh-huh!

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.353
lnside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

00:49:49.393 --> 00:49:53.921
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

00:49:57.334 --> 00:49:58.631
Aah!

00:49:58.669 --> 00:50:00.967
-Careful, Sharkbait!
-l can't do it!

00:50:01.005 --> 00:50:02.529
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

00:50:02.573 --> 00:50:04.336
He'll be fine. Try again!

00:50:04.375 --> 00:50:07.071
OK.

00:50:07.111 --> 00:50:09.579
GlLL: That's it, Sharkbait.

00:50:09.613 --> 00:50:11.911
Nice and steady.

00:50:14.385 --> 00:50:15.943
l got it! l got it!

00:50:15.986 --> 00:50:18.716
-He did it!
-That's great, kid!

00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:20.951
Now swim up the tube
and out.

00:50:38.242 --> 00:50:40.972
Oh, no! Gill!

00:50:41.011 --> 00:50:42.205
-Sharkbait!
-Oh, my gosh!

00:50:42.246 --> 00:50:43.474
Get him outta there!

00:50:43.514 --> 00:50:46.039
-What do we do?
-Oh, no!

00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:48.051
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:50.485
Help me!

00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:52.887
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

00:50:56.393 --> 00:50:58.361
-No! No! No!
-Feed me more!

00:50:58.395 --> 00:51:01.330
-That's it!
-Sharkbait! Grab it!

00:51:01.365 --> 00:51:04.061
l got it!

00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:05.898
Pull!

00:51:12.576 --> 00:51:15.272
PEACH: Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

00:51:16.513 --> 00:51:20.540
No. We're done.

00:51:33.597 --> 00:51:35.292
CRUSH: Dude.

00:51:35.332 --> 00:51:38.392
-Uhh.
-Dude.

00:51:38.435 --> 00:51:42.929
Focus, dude. Dude.

00:51:42.973 --> 00:51:44.600
Ohh.

00:51:44.642 --> 00:51:46.234
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!

00:51:46.277 --> 00:51:49.644
MARLlN:
Ohh. What happened?

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.739
Saw the whole thing, dude.

00:51:51.782 --> 00:51:53.647
First, you were all,
like, ''Whoa!''...

00:51:53.684 --> 00:51:55.311
and then we were
all, like, ''Whoa!''...

00:51:55.352 --> 00:51:57.252
and then you were,
like, ''Whoa.''

00:51:57.288 --> 00:51:58.721
MARLlN:
What are you talking about?

00:51:58.756 --> 00:52:02.192
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

00:52:02.226 --> 00:52:05.059
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

00:52:05.095 --> 00:52:06.357
-Ohh.
-Awesome.

00:52:06.397 --> 00:52:09.594
Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!

00:52:09.633 --> 00:52:11.601
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

00:52:11.635 --> 00:52:12.829
Just waxed it.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:15.100
So, Mr. Turtle--

00:52:15.139 --> 00:52:17.505
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:18.974
The name's Crush.

00:52:19.009 --> 00:52:21.341
Crush? Really?

00:52:21.378 --> 00:52:26.042
OK, Crush. l need to
the East Australian Current.

00:52:26.083 --> 00:52:27.311
E.A.C.?

00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:29.285
Oh, dude.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.686
You're ridin' it, dude!

00:52:31.722 --> 00:52:34.350
Check it out!

00:52:55.279 --> 00:52:57.144
OK, grab shell, dude!

00:52:57.181 --> 00:52:58.949
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

00:52:58.949 --> 00:52:59.506
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

00:53:08.325 --> 00:53:10.987
Ha ha! Righteous!
Righteous!

00:53:11.028 --> 00:53:15.766
-Yeah!
-Stop!

00:53:15.766 --> 00:53:18.234
So...

00:53:18.268 --> 00:53:21.795
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:24.433
Dory and l need
to get to Sydney.

00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:26.705
Dory!
ls she all right?

00:53:26.744 --> 00:53:28.541
Huh? Oh, little blue.

00:53:29.646 --> 00:53:31.238
She is sub-level, dude.

00:53:35.386 --> 00:53:37.946
Dory! Dory! Dory!

00:53:37.988 --> 00:53:39.717
Dory.

00:53:41.458 --> 00:53:44.291
l'm so sorry.

00:53:44.328 --> 00:53:47.661
This is all my fault.
lt's my fault.

00:53:47.698 --> 00:53:52.669
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here l come!

00:53:52.669 --> 00:53:54.694
There you are!

00:53:55.973 --> 00:53:58.840
Catch me if you can!

00:53:58.876 --> 00:54:01.242
Dory?

00:54:01.278 --> 00:54:03.109
KlD: Nice wave!

00:54:03.147 --> 00:54:05.172
Oh, wow!

00:54:05.215 --> 00:54:06.876
Heh heh.

00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:07.351
Up you go!

00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:08.750
Up you go!

00:54:08.786 --> 00:54:11.778
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

00:54:11.822 --> 00:54:13.255
Whoa! Whoa!

00:54:14.558 --> 00:54:16.890
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

00:54:18.796 --> 00:54:21.390
-Oh, my goodness!
-Kill the motor, dude.

00:54:21.432 --> 00:54:24.765
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

00:54:30.507 --> 00:54:33.203
Whoa!

00:54:33.243 --> 00:54:36.235
Whoa! That was so cool!

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.077
Hey, Dad,
did you see that?

00:54:38.115 --> 00:54:40.447
Did you see me?
Did you see what l did?

00:54:40.484 --> 00:54:43.453
You so totally rock, Squirt!

00:54:43.487 --> 00:54:45.011
So give me some fin.

00:54:45.055 --> 00:54:46.454
Noggin.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:47.855
-Dude.
-Dude.

00:54:47.891 --> 00:54:49.290
Oh...intro.

00:54:49.326 --> 00:54:51.226
Jellyman, offspring.

00:54:51.261 --> 00:54:53.320
Offspring, Jellyman.

00:54:53.363 --> 00:54:56.890
-Jellies?! Sweet.
-Totally.

00:54:56.934 --> 00:55:00.165
Apparently, l must've done
something you liked...dudes.

00:55:00.204 --> 00:55:02.638
-You rock, dude!
-Ow.

00:55:02.673 --> 00:55:07.406
Curl away, my son.
lt's awesome, Jellyman.

00:55:07.444 --> 00:55:09.105
The little dudes
are just eggs.

00:55:09.146 --> 00:55:10.909
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

00:55:10.948 --> 00:55:12.210
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

00:55:12.249 --> 00:55:14.649
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

00:55:14.685 --> 00:55:17.017
-All by themselves?
-Yeah.

00:55:17.054 --> 00:55:20.046
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:21.318
Well, you never really know.

00:55:21.358 --> 00:55:24.759
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

00:55:28.999 --> 00:55:30.432
Hey, look, everybody.

00:55:30.467 --> 00:55:33.163
l know that dude!
lt's the Jellyman!

00:55:33.203 --> 00:55:35.228
DORY: Go on. Jump on him!

00:55:35.272 --> 00:55:38.469
-Turtle pile!
-Wait, wait, wait!

00:55:38.509 --> 00:55:40.568
-Are you funny?
-Where's your shell?

00:55:40.611 --> 00:55:42.670
-l need to breathe!
-Are you running away?

00:55:42.713 --> 00:55:44.374
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

00:55:44.414 --> 00:55:46.382
-Did they sting you?
-One at a time!

00:55:46.416 --> 00:55:48.077
Mr. Fish, did you die?

00:55:48.118 --> 00:55:50.643
DORY: Sorry, l was
a little vague on the details.

00:55:50.687 --> 00:55:51.847
So, where are you going?

00:55:51.889 --> 00:55:53.754
You see, my son was taken.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.623
My son was taken away from me.

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:58.924
-No way.
-What happened?

00:55:58.962 --> 00:56:01.123
No, no, kids.
l don't want to talk about it.

00:56:01.165 --> 00:56:03.497
ALL: Aww! Please?

00:56:03.534 --> 00:56:04.865
Please?

00:56:04.902 --> 00:56:07.638
Well, OK.

00:56:07.638 --> 00:56:11.472
l live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

00:56:11.508 --> 00:56:13.533
This is gonna be good.
l can tell.

00:56:13.577 --> 00:56:15.977
And my son Nemo...

00:56:16.013 --> 00:56:17.981
See, he was mad at me.

00:56:18.015 --> 00:56:19.642
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

00:56:19.683 --> 00:56:21.173
if l hadn't been
so tough on him.

00:56:21.218 --> 00:56:22.446
l don't know.

00:56:22.486 --> 00:56:24.477
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:27.388
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

00:56:27.424 --> 00:56:30.052
and l tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

00:56:30.093 --> 00:56:31.856
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

00:56:31.895 --> 00:56:34.227
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

00:56:34.264 --> 00:56:37.028
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

00:56:37.067 --> 00:56:38.364
...three ferocious sharks.

00:56:38.402 --> 00:56:40.495
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

00:56:40.537 --> 00:56:41.868
Golly, that's amazing.

00:56:41.905 --> 00:56:43.532
And then dives
thousands of feet...

00:56:43.574 --> 00:56:45.303
...straight down
into the dark.

00:56:45.342 --> 00:56:46.809
lt's wicked dark down there.

00:56:46.843 --> 00:56:48.538
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

00:56:48.579 --> 00:56:50.240
And the only thing
they can see down there...

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.009
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

00:56:52.049 --> 00:56:54.017
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

00:56:54.051 --> 00:56:55.416
And then he has
to blast his way...

00:56:55.452 --> 00:56:57.079
So, these two little fish
have been...

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:00.657
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

00:57:00.657 --> 00:57:02.989
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

00:57:03.026 --> 00:57:04.550
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

00:57:04.595 --> 00:57:05.892
...in a matter of days.
l mean, it sounds like...

00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:07.920
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

00:57:07.965 --> 00:57:10.729
...till he finds his son.
l sure hope he makes it.

00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:13.759
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

00:57:19.376 --> 00:57:21.310
GULLS: Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

00:57:21.345 --> 00:57:26.647
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

00:57:26.683 --> 00:57:28.378
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

00:57:28.418 --> 00:57:31.819
Would you just shut up?!

00:57:31.855 --> 00:57:33.322
You're rats with wings!

00:57:33.357 --> 00:57:34.847
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:37.223
-Nemo?!
-He was taken off the reef...

00:57:37.261 --> 00:57:40.287
-Take it! You happy?
-Mine! Mine! Mine!

00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:43.128
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:44.326
Mine! Mine! Mine!

00:57:44.368 --> 00:57:45.858
Whoooa....

00:57:45.902 --> 00:57:47.062
Hyah!

00:57:47.104 --> 00:57:48.662
Mine?

00:57:48.705 --> 00:57:50.935
Last l heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

00:57:50.974 --> 00:57:53.408
Ho ho! Brilliant!

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:07.791
ls he doing OK?

00:58:07.791 --> 00:58:08.314
ls he doing OK?

00:58:08.358 --> 00:58:11.555
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r--

00:58:11.595 --> 00:58:14.462
lt's OK. l know who
you're talking about.

00:58:22.472 --> 00:58:23.803
Gill?

00:58:26.276 --> 00:58:28.005
Gill?

00:58:28.045 --> 00:58:30.707
Hey, Sharkbait.

00:58:30.747 --> 00:58:32.977
l'm sorry l couldn't stop the--

00:58:33.016 --> 00:58:35.177
No, l'm the one
who should be sorry.

00:58:35.218 --> 00:58:37.846
l was so ready
to get out...

00:58:37.888 --> 00:58:40.652
so ready to taste that ocean...

00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:44.127
l was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:48.120
Nothing should be worth that.

00:58:48.165 --> 00:58:51.396
l'm sorry l couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

00:58:55.105 --> 00:58:58.006
All right.
Hey, hey, hey--

00:58:58.041 --> 00:58:59.668
-What the--
-Aaah!

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:03.441
That's one way to pull a tooth.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.573
Huh. Darn kids.

00:59:05.615 --> 00:59:08.607
Good thing l pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

00:59:08.652 --> 00:59:10.210
NlGEL: Hey, psst!

00:59:10.253 --> 00:59:12.244
PEACH: Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:14.917
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

00:59:14.958 --> 00:59:17.017
What am l talking about?
Where's Nemo?

00:59:17.127 --> 00:59:19.391
-l've got to speak with him.
-What is it?

00:59:19.429 --> 00:59:21.522
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

00:59:21.565 --> 00:59:24.193
-looking for you.
-My father? Really?

00:59:24.234 --> 00:59:28.364
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish--

00:59:28.405 --> 00:59:30.896
Sharks? That can't be him.

00:59:30.941 --> 00:59:33.535
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

00:59:33.577 --> 00:59:35.738
-Tuna? Trout?
-Marlin?

00:59:35.779 --> 00:59:37.610
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

00:59:37.647 --> 00:59:40.241
lt's my dad!
He took on a shark!

00:59:40.283 --> 00:59:42.615
l heard he took on three.

00:59:42.652 --> 00:59:45.485
-Three sharks?
-That's 4,800 teeth!

00:59:45.522 --> 00:59:47.615
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

00:59:47.657 --> 00:59:49.887
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

00:59:49.926 --> 00:59:51.291
Really?

00:59:51.328 --> 00:59:53.125
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

00:59:53.163 --> 00:59:55.222
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

00:59:55.265 --> 00:59:57.529
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

00:59:57.567 --> 01:00:00.400
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

01:00:00.437 --> 01:00:03.065
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

01:00:03.106 --> 01:00:05.472
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:08.706
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A.C...

01:00:08.745 --> 01:00:12.237
and the word is he's headed
this way right now...to Sydney!

01:00:12.282 --> 01:00:13.647
-Wow!
-What a good daddy!

01:00:13.683 --> 01:00:16.243
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

01:00:19.756 --> 01:00:21.383
GURGLE:
He's swimming to the filter!

01:00:21.425 --> 01:00:22.915
-Sharkbait!
-Not again!

01:00:24.461 --> 01:00:27.396
Sharkbait!

01:00:27.431 --> 01:00:28.796
No!

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:30.026
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

01:00:30.066 --> 01:00:32.466
-We'll help you, kid!
-Get him out!

01:00:36.773 --> 01:00:38.434
Get him out of there!

01:00:38.475 --> 01:00:40.102
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

01:00:40.143 --> 01:00:42.737
Sharkbait!

01:00:42.779 --> 01:00:44.804
-No!
-Can you hear me?

01:00:44.848 --> 01:00:46.338
Nemo! Can you hear me?

01:00:46.383 --> 01:00:48.408
Yeah, l can hear you.

01:00:48.452 --> 01:00:50.386
Sharkbait, you did it!

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.220
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

01:00:54.257 --> 01:00:56.326
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

01:00:56.326 --> 01:00:58.817
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

01:00:58.862 --> 01:01:00.159
before Darla gets here.

01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:01.892
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

01:01:01.932 --> 01:01:04.765
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

01:01:04.801 --> 01:01:07.065
-Jacques? No cleaning.
-l shall resist.

01:01:07.103 --> 01:01:09.765
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

01:01:09.806 --> 01:01:11.034
Think dirty thoughts.

01:01:11.074 --> 01:01:13.269
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.835
the dentist
will have to clean it.

01:01:15.879 --> 01:01:17.972
-Good work!
-Ha ha ha!

01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:27.046
All right, we're here, dudes!

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:30.287
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

01:01:30.327 --> 01:01:31.817
MARLlN:
Where? l don't see it!

01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:34.296
DORY: Right there!
l see it! l see it!

01:01:34.331 --> 01:01:37.459
MARLlN:
The swirling vortex of terror?

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:39.799
-That's it, dude.
-Of course it is.

01:01:39.836 --> 01:01:43.863
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:46.398
Do you have your exit buddy?

01:01:46.443 --> 01:01:47.671
Yes!

01:01:47.711 --> 01:01:52.444
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

01:01:52.482 --> 01:01:56.009
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

01:01:56.052 --> 01:01:59.749
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:02.724
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

01:02:02.759 --> 01:02:06.024
Remember--
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

01:02:06.062 --> 01:02:09.190
He's trying to speak to me,
l know it!

01:02:09.232 --> 01:02:12.463
You're really cute, but l don't
know what you're saying!

01:02:12.502 --> 01:02:13.764
Say the first thing again.

01:02:13.803 --> 01:02:16.328
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

01:02:21.578 --> 01:02:25.105
-Whoa!
-Wahoo!

01:02:25.148 --> 01:02:27.207
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

01:02:29.252 --> 01:02:30.651
Whoo!

01:02:30.687 --> 01:02:33.281
That was...fun!

01:02:33.323 --> 01:02:35.587
l actually enjoyed that.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:37.252
Hey, look, turtles!

01:02:37.294 --> 01:02:40.229
CRUSH: Ha ha!
Most excellent!

01:02:40.263 --> 01:02:42.026
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

01:02:42.065 --> 01:02:45.262
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

01:02:45.302 --> 01:02:47.463
No worries, man!

01:02:47.504 --> 01:02:49.563
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

01:02:49.606 --> 01:02:52.166
-Bye!
-Bye, Jellyman!

01:02:52.208 --> 01:02:54.506
You tell your little dude
l said hi, OK?

01:02:54.544 --> 01:02:55.704
SQUlRT:
See ya later, dudes!

01:02:55.745 --> 01:02:57.474
DORY: Bye, everyone!

01:02:57.514 --> 01:02:59.846
Nemo would have loved this.

01:02:59.883 --> 01:03:03.216
Ooh! Hey! Crush, l forgot!

01:03:03.253 --> 01:03:04.811
How old are you?

01:03:04.854 --> 01:03:09.052
CRUSH: 1 50, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

01:03:09.092 --> 01:03:13.119
150! 150!
l gotta remember that.

01:03:13.163 --> 01:03:14.357
Whoa.

01:03:19.169 --> 01:03:21.797
-We going in there?
-Yep.

01:03:21.838 --> 01:03:23.897
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:29.572
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

01:03:29.613 --> 01:03:32.377
¶¶ Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming ¶¶

01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:33.575
Dory...

01:03:42.359 --> 01:03:44.987
MARLlN:
Boy, this is taking awhile.

01:03:45.028 --> 01:03:46.723
DORY:
How about we play a game?

01:03:46.763 --> 01:03:48.025
MARLlN: OK.

01:03:48.064 --> 01:03:51.124
DORY: OK, l'm thinking
of something orange...

01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:52.657
and it's small--

01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:55.000
-lt's me.
-Right!

01:03:55.038 --> 01:03:58.599
lt's orange and small--

01:03:58.642 --> 01:03:59.939
lt's me.

01:03:59.976 --> 01:04:01.876
All righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

01:04:01.911 --> 01:04:02.779
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

01:04:02.779 --> 01:04:05.077
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

01:04:05.115 --> 01:04:07.345
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

01:04:07.384 --> 01:04:09.909
-That's just scary.
-Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:09.953 --> 01:04:11.784
l have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:13.345
That means
we've passed it before...

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:14.755
and that means
we're going in circles...

01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:16.349
and that means
we're not going straight!

01:04:16.459 --> 01:04:18.552
-Hey, hey!
-Get to the surface.

01:04:18.595 --> 01:04:20.187
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:22.425
-Hey! Relax.
-What?

01:04:22.465 --> 01:04:25.059
Take a deep breath.

01:04:27.003 --> 01:04:27.504
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

01:04:27.504 --> 01:04:29.301
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

01:04:29.339 --> 01:04:31.364
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

01:04:31.408 --> 01:04:33.774
-There's nobody here!
-There has to be someone.

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:36.677
lt's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

01:04:36.713 --> 01:04:39.045
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

01:04:39.082 --> 01:04:43.542
Nope. Nada.

01:04:44.954 --> 01:04:46.751
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse--

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:48.621
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

01:04:48.658 --> 01:04:50.250
l'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

01:04:50.293 --> 01:04:52.659
lt's a fish we don't know.
lf we ask it directions...

01:04:52.696 --> 01:04:54.721
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

01:04:54.764 --> 01:04:57.232
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

01:04:57.267 --> 01:04:59.064
l don't want to play
the gender card right now.

01:04:59.102 --> 01:05:01.036
Let's play
the ''Let's Not Die'' card.

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.971
-You want to get out of here?
-Of course l do.

01:05:03.006 --> 01:05:06.271
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:08.300
Dory, you don't
fully understand--

01:05:08.344 --> 01:05:10.335
Come on. Trust me on this.

01:05:18.421 --> 01:05:22.258
All right.

01:05:22.258 --> 01:05:25.523
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo!
Little fella?

01:05:25.562 --> 01:05:28.398
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

01:05:28.398 --> 01:05:29.490
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

01:05:29.532 --> 01:05:31.557
Ha. Hello.

01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:33.125
-His son Bingo--
-Nemo.

01:05:33.169 --> 01:05:36.195
-Nemo was taken to--
-Sydney.

01:05:36.239 --> 01:05:39.436
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

01:05:39.476 --> 01:05:41.410
that we get there
as fast as we can...

01:05:41.444 --> 01:05:43.537
so can you help us out?

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.107
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:50.381
Dory, l'm a little fella.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.923
l don't think
that's a little fella.

01:05:53.923 --> 01:05:57.825
DORY: Oh! Big fella.
Whale. OK.

01:05:57.861 --> 01:06:00.329
Maybe he only speaks whale.

01:06:00.363 --> 01:06:03.594
Mooo! Weee neeed...

01:06:03.633 --> 01:06:07.729
-Dory?
-Tooo fiind his son.

01:06:07.771 --> 01:06:10.433
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

01:06:10.473 --> 01:06:11.741
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

01:06:11.741 --> 01:06:13.868
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:16.242
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

01:06:16.279 --> 01:06:19.874
-See, he's swimming away.
-Cooome baaack.

01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:22.180
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

01:06:22.218 --> 01:06:23.412
-Maybe a different dialect.

01:06:23.453 --> 01:06:26.650
-Moooohhhmmooo...
-Dory!

01:06:26.689 --> 01:06:29.954
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

01:06:29.993 --> 01:06:30.293
-Maybe l should try humpback.
-Don't.

01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:32.193
-Maybe l should try humpback.
-Don't.

01:06:32.228 --> 01:06:33.695
Wooooooo...

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.699
-You actually sound sick.
-Maybe louder?

01:06:36.733 --> 01:06:38.200
-Rah! Rah!
-Don't do that!

01:06:38.234 --> 01:06:39.963
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

01:06:40.003 --> 01:06:41.334
lt doesn't sound orca.

01:06:41.371 --> 01:06:43.168
lt sounds like nothing
l've ever heard.

01:06:43.206 --> 01:06:45.697
-Oooooo!
-Ohh!

01:06:45.742 --> 01:06:46.309
lt's just as well.
He might be hungry.

01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:47.674
lt's just as well.
He might be hungry.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.702
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

01:06:50.747 --> 01:06:54.274
-KRlLL: Swim away!
-Oh, look, krill!

01:06:59.255 --> 01:07:01.314
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:08.025
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

01:07:08.064 --> 01:07:12.023
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

01:07:12.068 --> 01:07:15.060
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

01:07:15.104 --> 01:07:17.129
Jacques,
l said no cleaning.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.003
l am ashamed.

01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:21.510
Look! Scum angel!

01:07:23.746 --> 01:07:25.680
Ooh! Aaah!

01:07:25.715 --> 01:07:27.649
Bubbles!
l love the bubbles!

01:07:29.719 --> 01:07:33.348
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

01:07:33.389 --> 01:07:36.017
9:00 and cue dentist.

01:07:36.059 --> 01:07:38.323
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry l'm late.

01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:41.057
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

01:07:41.097 --> 01:07:42.826
Little Davey Reynolds...

01:07:42.866 --> 01:07:44.458
PEACH: Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.593
Bloat, that's disgusting!

01:07:46.636 --> 01:07:48.661
Tastes pretty good to me.

01:07:48.705 --> 01:07:50.468
-Urrrp!
-Eww!

01:07:50.506 --> 01:07:53.373
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own--

01:07:53.409 --> 01:07:54.501
Shh! Here he comes!

01:07:54.544 --> 01:07:56.512
NEMO: Aah!

01:07:56.546 --> 01:07:59.845
Crikey. What a state.

01:08:01.317 --> 01:08:05.447
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

01:08:05.488 --> 01:08:08.423
-10:00, luv.
-Leave it open, would you?

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:10.790
l've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:12.920
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

01:08:12.962 --> 01:08:16.659
NEMO: Yay!
He's gonna clean the tank!

01:08:16.699 --> 01:08:18.462
We're gonna be clean!

01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:20.162
You ready to see your dad, kid?

01:08:20.203 --> 01:08:22.137
-Uh-huh.
-Of course you are.

01:08:22.171 --> 01:08:24.799
l wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

01:08:24.841 --> 01:08:25.408
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

01:08:25.408 --> 01:08:28.070
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

01:08:28.111 --> 01:08:30.477
Yeah.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.661
Aaah!

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:36.536
Oof!

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.201
Whoo!

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.440
Yaahhh!

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.210
DORY: Here comes the big one.

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:49.774
Ooh! Come on!
You gotta try this!

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:53.084
-Will you just stop it?
-Why? What's wrong?

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.420
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:56.618
-Whale?
-A whale!

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:59.389
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:02.192
Wow, a whale.
l speak whale.

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.563
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.797
l have to get out!
l have to find my son!

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:13.241
l have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:18.444
Ohhh!

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:22.477
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:27.086
Hey...

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:29.387
you OK?

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:38.456
There, there.
lt's all right.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:40.435
lt'll be OK.

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.699
No. No, it won't.

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.968
Sure it will. You'll see.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:51.139
No. l promised him l'd never
let anything happen to him.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.581
Huh. That's a funny thing
to promise.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:55.982
What?

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:58.452
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.921
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.723
Not much fun for little Harpo.

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.402
-Hmm.
-What's going on?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.738
Don't know. l'll ask him.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:28.308
-Dory...
-Whaaat's goooing onnn?

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.948
l think he says we've stopped.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:39.256
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.093
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:49.000
Oh, no. Look what you did.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:53.998
The water's going down.
lt's going down!

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.146
Really? You sure about that?

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:01.240
Look!
Already it's half empty!

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:03.046
l'd say it's half full.

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.552
Stop that! lt's half empty!

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.820
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.429
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:13.758
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.957
or he wants a root beer float.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.625
Of course he wants us
to go there!

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.600
That's eating us!

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:22.604
How do l taste, Moby?
Do l taste good?

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.902
Tell him l'm not interested
in being lunch!

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.408
-OK. Heee--
-Stop talking to him!

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.546
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:34.742
What is going on?

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:37.082
l'll check. Whaaat--

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.883
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.254
-Yes, l can!
-No, you can't!

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:45.852
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:53.699
-OK.
-Dory! Oof!

01:12:56.272 --> 01:12:59.867
He says it's time to let go.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.877
Everything's gonna be
all right.

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.572
How do you know?

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:06.706
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.649
l don't!

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:24.166
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.064
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.863
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:34.038
Ha ha ha!
We're alive!

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.977
Look! Sy-d-ney--Sydney!

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.447
Sydney! Sydney again!

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.919
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:47.889
We're gonna find my son!

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:50.893
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:53.953
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.464
Wow. l wish
l could speak whale.

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.796
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:01.928
-Right!
-We can do this!

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.849
Morning.

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:21.152
lt's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.351
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:26.452
and we are getting out--
The tank is clean.

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:29.055
The tank is clean!

01:14:29.098 --> 01:14:30.690
DEB: But how?

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:33.429
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.927
-What are we gonna do?
-What's it say, Peach?

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.638
l can't hear you, Peach.

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:42.109
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.112
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:47.138
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.410
Stop it!

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.940
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.283
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.016
Scan? What does that mean?

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.489
Aah!

01:14:58.894 --> 01:14:59.295
AQUASCUM:
Temperature--82 degrees...

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:00.455
AQUASCUM:
Temperature--82 degrees...

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.157
PH balance--normal.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.597
-Ooh.
-Nice.

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:09.195
Ooh--Oh!
Curse you, Aquascum!

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.331
That's it for the escape plan.
lt's ruined.

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.806
Then what are
we gonna do about--

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:13.309
Darla!

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:14.833
Darla!

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:17.471
Stay down, kid!

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.481
-False alarm.
-Whew.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.608
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.880
BLOAT: What'll we do
when that brat gets here?

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:26.149
-l'm thinking.
-Oh! Gill!

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:29.351
-Nemo! l'm coming!
-Help me! Help me!

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:33.293
Swim down! Come on, kid!

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:34.819
-Everybody jump in!
-Swim down!

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.160
-That's it!
-What the--?

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:39.463
-Yay!
-Ha ha! Good work!

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.025
Gill!

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:42.662
-Nemo!
-Sharkbait!

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:46.106
-Roll, kid!
-Lean! Lean!

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:53.013
DENTlST: Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.642
Gill!
Don't let me go belly-up!

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:57.982
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:00.420
l promise.
You're gonna be OK.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.417
Darla!

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:12.628
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.568
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.730
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:19.502
l'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.304
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.174
Duck!

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:26.613
That's not a duck.
lt's a...pelican!

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.081
-Whoa!
-Aah!

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:35.917
-Whoa!
-Aah!

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:39.223
No! l didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:49.203
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:50.603
What? What?

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:53.506
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:56.170
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:58.202
ALL: Yeah, right. Yeah.

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:01.876
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:07.922
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.559
-Aah!

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:10.923
-Aah!

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:15.788
Nemo? He's that fish!

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:18.391
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:20.902

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:24.233
Wait! Come back! Stop!

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:26.503
Dory, keep going!
He's crazy!

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:28.305
l got something to tell you!

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.138
Mine.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:41.747
Don't make any sudden moves.

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:46.056
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:49.724
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:50.925
GULL: Mine?

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:51.300
NlGEL: Because
l can take you to your son.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.599
NlGEL: Because
l can take you to your son.

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:57.298
-Yeah, right.
-No. l know your son.

01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.035
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.235
-That's Nemo!
-Aah!

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:17.777
Keep swimming!

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.663

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:33.292

Nemo?

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:49.880
Nemo?

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:53.911
lt's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.519
Daddy?

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:01.085
Oh, thank goodness.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.826
Dad...l don't hate you.

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:06.697
Oh, no, no, no.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.396
l'm so sorry, Nemo.

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:21.513
-Hey, guess what?
-What?

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.041
Sea turtles--l met one.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:29.284
And he was 150 years old.

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:33.488
-150?
-Yep.

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:38.363
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.957
Sandy Plankton?

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.992
Do you think l would
cross the entire ocean...

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:44.129
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:46.834
-Ha ha ha!
-He was 150! Not 100!

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:50.743
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:53.047
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:56.039

-Aw, my own son beats me!

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:05.492
Climb aboard, explorers.

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:08.654
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:11.563
''With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?''

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:15.498
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:19.061
-Exchange student.

-Sweet!
-Totally.

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.746
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.475
BRUCE: Pardon me.

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:30.211
-Hello.
-Ohh.

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.912
Don't be alarmed.

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:35.719
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:38.089
-Thanks, guys.
-See you next week.

01:31:38.126 --> 01:31:41.584

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:51.468
NEMO: Bye, Dad!

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:54.942
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:02.242
Love you, Dad.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.274
l love you, too, son.

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:09.955
Dad? You can let go now.

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:13.722
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:15.991
Good-bye!
See ya later, dudes!

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:18.531
-Bye, Elmo!

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:22.024
-Bye, Nemo!

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.470

Bye, Dad!

01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:27.066
Bye, son.

01:32:44.092 --> 01:32:47.084
DENTlST: Barbara,
l don't understand it.

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:49.494
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.758
and it breaks!

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:53.096
l had to clean the tank myself,
take all the fish out...

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:55.500
put 'em in bags, and--

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:58.027
Where'd the fish go?

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:04.606
-Come on, Peach!
-Hurry!

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.476
-You can do it!
-That's it.

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:07.947
Just a little further.

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:10.212
PEACH: That's the shortest
red light l've ever seen!

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.481
-Come on, Peach!
-Ohh. Aah!

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.626
