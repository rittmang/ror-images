Your file, which I've read
in its entirety.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.420
And I have a few questions.
Did you or did you not

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:49.460
burn the Côte de Roc restaurant
in Antibes to the ground?

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.130
- Um...
- And did you or did you not fire a guided missile

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:54.970
at a peloton
of French cyclists?

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:57.440
- W-Well...
- Before commandeering

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.240

the tour guide off the top deck

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.910
and then assaulting
an 82-year-old grandmother

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:03.440

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.540

how hard it is to be me?

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.550
- Uh...
- Hmm?

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:19.060
Do you have
even the foggiest notion

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.060
of how virtually
impossible it is

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.190
