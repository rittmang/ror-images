WEBVTT

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.259
October is inventory time,

00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:33.969
so right now, Statler Toyota

00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:35.929
is making the best deals of the year

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:38.182
on all 1985-model Toyotas.

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.808
You won't find a better car

00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:43.187
at a better price with better
service anywhere in Hill Valley.

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.565
That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:52.529
The Senate is
expected to vote on this today.

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:56.784
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:59.536
have denied the rumor that
a case of missing plutonium

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:02.873
was in fact stolen from
their vault two weeks ago.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:05.417
A Libyan terrorist group
had claimed responsibility

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:06.710
for the alleged theft.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.879
However, officials now attribute

00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:11.381
the discrepancy to a
simple clerical error.

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:15.636
The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.

00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:58.720
Hey, Doc?

00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:02.432
Doc?

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:05.352
Hello! Anybody home?

00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:06.687
Einstein, come here, boy.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.357
What's going on? Oh, God.

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:13.151
Oh, Jesus!

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:17.030
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.278
Whoa!

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:42.658
Rock 'n' roll.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.417
Yo. DOC: Marty, is that you?

00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:54.544
Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you?

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:55.796
Thank God I've found you.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.298
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:00.133
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:01.426
Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:02.511
Yeah.

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:04.262
Doc, what's going on?

00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:06.306
Where you been all week? Working.

00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:07.766
Where's Einstein? Is he with you?

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.559
Yeah, he's right here.

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:12.270
You know, Doc, you left
your equipment on all week.

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:14.940
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:16.483
You better not hook up to the amplifier.

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:18.860
There's a slight
possibility of overload.

00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:21.321
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:23.824
Good. I'll see you
tonight. Don't forget now.

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.701
1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:26.827
Right.

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:35.335
Are those my clocks I hear?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.088
Yeah, it's 8:00.

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.674
Perfect! My experiment worked!

00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:43.260
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

00:05:44.262 --> 00:05:46.263
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:49.016
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.225
Precisely.

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:53.687
Damn! I'm late for school.

00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:55.499
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:56.583
Strickland's looking for you.

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.002
If you get caught, it'll
be four tardies in a row.

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:03.298
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:05.509
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:07.928
The doc set all his
clocks 25 minutes slow.

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:09.262
Doc?

00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:12.724
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:16.311
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:20.690
And one for you, McFly. I
believe that makes four in a row.

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:23.735
Let me give you a nickel's
worth of free advice, young man.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.988
This so-called Dr. Brown is
dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

00:07:27.073 --> 00:07:29.491
You hang around with him, you're
gonna end up in big trouble.

00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:30.867
Ooh. Yes, sir.

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:35.163
You got a real attitude
problem, McFly. You're a slacker.

00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:37.082
You remind me of your
father when he went here.

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.543
He was a slacker, too.

00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:41.711
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:43.463
I noticed your band is on the roster

00:07:43.548 --> 00:07:45.549
for the dance auditions
after school today.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:48.051
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:49.928
You're too much like your old man.

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.264
No McFly ever amounted to anything

00:07:52.348 --> 00:07:54.057
in the history of Hill Valley.

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:58.186
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.773
Next, please.

00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:08.738
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:12.367
All right.

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:15.912
We're the... We're the Pinheads.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.040
One, two, three.

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:41.730
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:43.940
Hold it, fellas.

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:46.693
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:48.987
Next, please.

00:08:51.157 --> 00:08:53.491
Bring up the next group, please.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.371
Re-elect
Mayor "Goldie" Wilson.

00:08:58.456 --> 00:09:00.457
Progress is his middle name.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.626
"Too loud." I can't believe it.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.337
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:07.797
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:10.300
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:12.344
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good,

00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:14.221
and this audition
tape of yours is great.

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:16.348
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:18.225
It's like Doc's always
saying. Yeah, I know. I know.

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:19.351
"If you put your mind to it,

00:09:19.435 --> 00:09:21.937
"you can accomplish anything."

00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.022
That's good advice, Marty.

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:25.565
All right, okay, Jennifer.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.609
What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

00:09:27.693 --> 00:09:29.611
What if they say I'm no good?

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:31.988
What if they say, "Get out of
here, kid. You got no future"?

00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:35.283
I mean, I just don't think I
can take that kind of rejection.

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:37.369
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

00:09:37.453 --> 00:09:39.204
Come on. He's not that
bad. Save the clock tower.

00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:42.832
At least he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:45.418
Check out that 4x4.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.420
That is hot.

00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:48.755
Okay. Back her up.

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:52.092
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:56.054
Wouldn't it be great to take
that truck up to the lake?

00:09:57.056 --> 00:10:00.058
Throw a couple of
sleeping bags in the back.

00:10:01.394 --> 00:10:03.353
Lie out underneath the stars.

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:05.272
Stop it. What?

00:10:06.107 --> 00:10:08.733
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:10.026
No, get out of town.

00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:12.862
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:14.531
Jennifer, my mother would freak out

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.949
if she knew I was
going up there with you,

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.201
and I'd get the standard lecture about

00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:20.662
how she never did that kind
of stuff when she was a kid.

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:23.623
I mean, look, I think
the woman was born a nun.

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:26.209
She's just trying to
keep you respectable.

00:10:26.294 --> 00:10:28.461
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:29.754
Terrible.

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.508
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:37.637
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an
initiative to replace that clock.

00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:40.307
Thirty years ago, lightning
struck that clock tower

00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.142
and the clock hasn't run since.

00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:44.519
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society

00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:47.022
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:48.857
as part of our history and heritage.

00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:49.983
There you go, lady. There's a quarter.

00:10:50.067 --> 00:10:51.109
Thank you.

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:52.235
Don't forget to take a flyer.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320
Right.

00:10:53.404 --> 00:10:55.322
Save the clock tower!

00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:58.575
Where were we?

00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:00.160
Right about here.

00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:01.328
Jennifer!

00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:06.791
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.

00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:08.335
I'll call you tonight.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:09.544
I'll be at my grandma's.

00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:12.047
Here, let me give you the number.

00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:18.094
Bye.

00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:04.307
Bravo,
Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:07.477
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:12.482
Perfect. Just perfect.

00:12:18.948 --> 00:12:21.116
I can't believe you'd loan me your car

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.034
without telling me it had a blind spot.

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:24.702
Blind spot? I could've been killed.

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.414
Now, Biff, now, I never noticed

00:12:27.498 --> 00:12:31.501
that the car had any blind spot
before when I would drive it.

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:33.002
Hi, Son.

00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:35.296
What, are you
blind, McFly? It's there.

00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:37.257
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:40.343
Biff, can I assume

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.805
that your insurance is
going to pay for the damage?

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:46.182
My insurance? It's your car.

00:12:46.267 --> 00:12:47.475
Your insurance should pay for it.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.102
I wanna know who's
going to pay for this?

00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:51.062
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:52.230
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

00:12:52.314 --> 00:12:53.314
Ah...

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.358
And where's my reports?

00:12:55.443 --> 00:12:56.943
Well, I haven't finished those up yet,

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:59.696
but I figured since
they weren't due till...

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.699
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?

00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:05.702
Think, McFly. Think! All right.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:07.871
I got to have time to get them retyped.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.205
Do you realize what would happen

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.083
if I hand in my reports
in your handwriting?

00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:13.710
I'll get fired.

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.588
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.590
Would you? Of course not, Biff.

00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:21.134
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:24.053
Now, look. I'll finish
those reports on up tonight,

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.973
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.892
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.226
McFly, your shoe's untied.

00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:31.311
Oh.

00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:33.771
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.732
Got the place fixed
up nice, though, McFly.

00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:40.069
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:41.821
and all you got for me is lite beer?

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:52.248
What are you looking at, butthead?

00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.294
Say hi to your mom for me.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.090
I know what you're going to say, Son,

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.801
and you're right. You're right.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.890
But Biff just happens
to be my supervisor,

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:13.603
And I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.481
But the car, Dad.

00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:20.944
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.947
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:26.199
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:27.325
Do you have any clue?

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.078
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:32.080
I'm sorry.

00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:34.749
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.752
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:41.089
and headaches of playing at that dance.

00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:42.840
He's absolutely right, Marty.

00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:45.426
The last thing you need is headaches.

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:56.896
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

00:14:57.481 --> 00:14:59.857
Your Uncle Joey didn't
make parole again.

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:05.572
I think it would be nice if
you all dropped him a line.

00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:07.407
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.950
He's your brother, Mom.

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:12.870
Yeah. I think it's a major
embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.

00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:15.164
We all make mistakes in life, children.

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:16.958
God damn it. I'm late.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.710
David, watch your mouth!

00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:21.379
You come here and kiss your
mother before you go. Come here.

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:24.549
Come on, Mom. Make it
fast. I'll miss my bus.

00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:26.509
See you later, Pop.

00:15:26.594 --> 00:15:29.345
Time to change that oil.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:36.019
Hey, Marty. I'm not
your answering service.

00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:38.521
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:40.857
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.358
I don't like her, Marty.

00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:45.570
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:48.531
Oh, Mother, there's nothing
wrong with calling a boy.

00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:52.118
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:55.872
When I was your age, I never
chased a boy or called a boy

00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:58.499
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:02.045
Then how am I supposed
to ever meet anybody?

00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:05.173
Well, it'll just happen.

00:16:05.257 --> 00:16:06.758
Like the way I met your father.

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:10.553
That was so stupid. Grandpa
hit him with the car.

00:16:11.055 --> 00:16:12.805
It was meant to be.

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.185
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him,

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:18.936
then none of you would have been born.

00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.313
Yeah, well.

00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:22.649
I still don't understand
what Dad was doing

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:24.150
in the middle of the street.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.694
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:28.905
What, Lorraine? What?

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.325
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.118
and brought him into the house.

00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.413
He seemed so helpless,

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:43.169
like a little lost puppy, and
my heart just went out to him.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:46.422
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've
told us this story a million times.

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:47.840
You felt sorry for him,

00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:49.384
so you decided to go with him

00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:51.010
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

00:16:51.095 --> 00:16:54.263
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.226
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:01.354
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:08.945
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.032
It was then that I realized

00:17:13.117 --> 00:17:15.993
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.065
Hello.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.608
Marty, you didn't
fall asleep, did you?

00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:49.152
Doc.

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.613
No. No, don't be silly.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.950
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:58.870
Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?

00:17:58.954 --> 00:18:01.706
Yeah. I'm on my way.

00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:28.107
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy? Huh?

00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:24.372
Doc!

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:26.999
Marty! You made it!

00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:28.125
Yeah.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.294
Welcome to my latest
experiment. This is the big one,

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:32.255
the one I've been
waiting for all my life.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.798
Well, it's a DeLorean...

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.716
Bear with me, Marty. All your
questions will be answered.

00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:37.134
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

00:19:37.219 --> 00:19:38.261
Doc,

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.345
is that a DEVO suit?

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.721
Never mind that now.

00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:41.889
Not now.

00:19:41.974 --> 00:19:43.015
All right. I'm ready.

00:19:43.642 --> 00:19:45.351
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.603
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:51.274
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.,

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.609
and this is temporal
experiment number one.

00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:55.736
Come on, Einie. Hey,
hey, boy, get in there.

00:19:55.821 --> 00:19:58.114
That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.575
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:06.747
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:08.207
Okay.

00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:12.169
Please note that Einstein's clock

00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:15.172
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:16.841
Got it? Right. Check, Doc.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:17.925
Good.

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:23.055
Have a good trip,
Einstein. Watch your head.

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:30.062
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:32.315
Watch this.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.692
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:39.989
Jesus!

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.537
Not me! The car! The car!

00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:06.182
If my calculations are correct,

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.352
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.854
you're going to see some serious shit.

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:49.558
Watch this. Watch this.

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:09.996
What did I tell you?

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.541
88 miles per hour!

00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.129
The temporal displacement occurred

00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:21.549
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:25.177
Jesus Christ!

00:22:25.262 --> 00:22:27.680
Jesus Christ, Doc! You
disintegrated Einstein!

00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:30.391
Calm down, Marty. I didn't
disintegrate anything.

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:35.187
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:36.647
Then where the hell are they?

00:22:36.732 --> 00:22:38.232
The appropriate question is,

00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:39.859
"When the hell are they?"

00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:44.405
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:47.825
I sent him into the future.

00:22:48.577 --> 00:22:50.953
One minute into the future, to be exact.

00:22:51.038 --> 00:22:54.248
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds,

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:57.209
we shall catch up with
him and the time machine.

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:02.757
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:07.303
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:09.638
out of a DeLorean?

00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:10.765
The way I see it,

00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:12.725
if you're going to build
a time machine into a car,

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.643
why not do it with some style?

00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:17.897
Besides, the stainless-steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:20.941
Look out!

00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:06.946
What? Is it hot?

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.739
It's cold. Damn cold.

00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:14.370
Einstein, you little devil!

00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:18.666
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.127
behind mine and still ticking!

00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:25.840
He's all right. He's fine.

00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:28.259
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

00:24:28.343 --> 00:24:30.970
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

00:24:31.054 --> 00:24:33.639
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:34.807
He skipped over that minute

00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.767
to instantly arrive
at this moment in time.

00:24:36.852 --> 00:24:38.686
Come here. I'll show you how it works.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:39.895
All right.

00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:44.316
First, you turn the time circuits on.

00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:49.697
This readout tells
you where you're going.

00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:50.990
This one tells you where you are.

00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:52.575
This one tells you where you were.

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:54.994
You input your destination
time on this keypad.

00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:56.328
Say you want to see the signing

00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:58.956
of the Declaration of Independence.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.043
Or witness the birth of Christ.

00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:08.465
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.260
November 5th, 1955.

00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:19.351
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

00:25:20.312 --> 00:25:21.937
What? I don't get it. What happened?

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.984
That was the day I invented time
travel. I remember it vividly.

00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:29.653
I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.

00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:30.863
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,

00:25:30.947 --> 00:25:32.489
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:34.617
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:38.037
a vision, a picture in my
head, a picture of this.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.459
This is what makes time travel
possible. The flux capacitor.

00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:45.336
Flux capacitor?

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.880
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:50.382
to realize the vision of that day.

00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:52.718
My God, has it been that long?

00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:56.222
Things have certainly
changed around here.

00:25:57.182 --> 00:25:59.058
I remember when this was all farmland

00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:01.268
as far as the eye could see.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.980
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

00:26:06.233 --> 00:26:09.818
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:17.409
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:20.412
Does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:22.081
Unfortunately, no. It requires something

00:26:22.165 --> 00:26:24.291
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:26.627
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:29.088
Are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:31.173
Hey, hey, hey! Keep
rolling. Keep rolling there.

00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:33.092
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:34.385
but I need a nuclear reaction

00:26:34.469 --> 00:26:36.929
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:40.599
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

00:26:41.184 --> 00:26:42.851
Did you rip that off?

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.606
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:48.899
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:51.443
so I took their plutonium and, in
turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing

00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:53.237
full of used pinball machine parts.

00:26:53.363 --> 00:26:55.281
Come on. Let's get you
a radiation suit. Jesus!

00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:56.740
We must prepare to reload.

00:27:25.895 --> 00:27:28.355
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

00:27:30.275 --> 00:27:32.401
Don't you lose those tapes now.

00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:33.902
I need that as a record.

00:27:34.487 --> 00:27:36.864
Let's put this back here. There we go.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.993
I almost forgot my luggage.

00:27:41.077 --> 00:27:43.829
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

00:27:43.913 --> 00:27:45.205
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.915
The future?

00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:48.709
That's where you're going?

00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:50.336
That's right, 25 years into the future.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.464
I've always dreamed of seeing the
future, looking beyond my years,

00:27:53.548 --> 00:27:55.674
seeing the progress of mankind.

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:56.967
Why not?

00:27:57.052 --> 00:28:00.846
I'll also be able to see who
wins the next 25 World Series.

00:28:01.222 --> 00:28:02.348
Doc.

00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:03.474
Huh?

00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:06.060
Look me up when you get there.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.313
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:18.113
I, Dr. Emmett Brown,

00:28:19.699 --> 00:28:22.576
am about to embark on
an historic journey.

00:28:24.496 --> 00:28:26.038
What am I thinking of?

00:28:26.122 --> 00:28:28.624
I almost forgot to
bring extra plutonium.

00:28:28.708 --> 00:28:31.251
How did I ever expect to get
back? One pellet, one trip.

00:28:31.336 --> 00:28:32.961
I must be out of my mind.

00:28:35.924 --> 00:28:37.591
What is it, Einie?

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:47.601
Oh, my God.

00:28:47.685 --> 00:28:50.479
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:51.647
Run for it, Marty!

00:28:51.731 --> 00:28:52.773
Who? Who?

00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:55.651
Who do you think? The Libyans!

00:28:58.947 --> 00:29:00.447
Holy shit!

00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:06.328
I'll draw their fire!

00:29:14.295 --> 00:29:15.337
Doc, wait!

00:29:29.936 --> 00:29:31.019
No!

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.814
You bastard!

00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:53.959
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

00:29:59.966 --> 00:30:01.008
Go!

00:30:41.883 --> 00:30:44.218
Come on! Move, damn it!

00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:46.970
Jesus!

00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:08.575
Holy shit!

00:31:09.327 --> 00:31:12.037
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.216
What is it? What is it, Pa?

00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:10.220
Looks like an airplane without wings.

00:32:10.763 --> 00:32:13.599
That ain't no airplane. Look.

00:32:34.662 --> 00:32:35.912
Children!

00:32:35.997 --> 00:32:37.331
Listen... Whoa.

00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:51.219
Hello?

00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:55.724
Excuse me.

00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:00.395
Sorry about your barn.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.444
It's already mutated
into human form! Shoot it!

00:33:09.364 --> 00:33:11.698
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

00:33:15.912 --> 00:33:17.079
Get away!

00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:19.414
Hold it.

00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:21.375
Shoot it, Pa!

00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:26.838
My pine! Why you...

00:33:28.883 --> 00:33:32.302
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

00:33:36.683 --> 00:33:38.642
All right. All right. Okay, McFly.

00:33:38.726 --> 00:33:40.852
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

00:33:40.937 --> 00:33:43.730
It's just a very intense dream.

00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:28.233
Listen, you got to help me.

00:34:28.317 --> 00:34:30.610
Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

00:34:32.655 --> 00:34:33.655
It can't be.

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.079
This is nuts.

00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:47.127
Come on.

00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:49.421
Perfect.

00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:48.373
Remember, fellow
citizens, the future is in your hands.

00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:52.252
If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

00:36:52.336 --> 00:36:54.379
Progress is his middle name.

00:36:54.463 --> 00:36:57.048
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform

00:36:57.133 --> 00:36:59.676
means more jobs, better education,

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.554
bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.641
On election day, cast your
vote for a proven leader.

00:37:06.726 --> 00:37:09.060
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:14.524
This has got to be a dream.

00:37:31.375 --> 00:37:34.294
Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:35.378
What?

00:37:35.463 --> 00:37:37.130
What's with the life preserver?

00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:44.387
I just want to use the phone.

00:37:44.472 --> 00:37:45.680
Yeah, it's in the back.

00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:49.935
Brown.

00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:53.730
Great. You're alive.

00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:07.035
Come on.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.336
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.047
Are you going to order something, kid?

00:38:20.675 --> 00:38:23.009
Yeah. Give me a Tab.

00:38:23.886 --> 00:38:26.304
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:28.473
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:31.309
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

00:38:31.394 --> 00:38:34.604
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

00:38:34.689 --> 00:38:36.690
Something without sugar.

00:38:44.073 --> 00:38:45.532
Hey, McFly.

00:38:47.952 --> 00:38:50.245
What do you think you're doing?

00:38:50.538 --> 00:38:51.621
Biff.

00:38:51.872 --> 00:38:54.374
I'm talking to you,
McFly, you Irish bug!

00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:56.626
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?

00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:58.461
You got my homework finished, McFly?

00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:01.798
Well, actually, I figured since
it wasn't due till Monday...

00:39:01.882 --> 00:39:03.675
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:07.137
Think, McFly. Think! Okay.

00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:09.097
I got to have time to recopy it.

00:39:09.181 --> 00:39:10.348
You realize what would happen

00:39:10.433 --> 00:39:12.934
if I hand in my homework
in your handwriting?

00:39:13.019 --> 00:39:14.728
I'll get kicked out of school.

00:39:14.812 --> 00:39:17.272
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.191
Would you?

00:39:20.276 --> 00:39:21.317
Now, of course not, Biff.

00:39:21.402 --> 00:39:23.319
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.

00:39:23.404 --> 00:39:24.946
What are you looking at, butthead?

00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:27.365
Biff, get a load of this
guy's life preserver.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.159
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

00:39:29.243 --> 00:39:31.536
How about my homework, McFly?

00:39:32.246 --> 00:39:35.540
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:38.918
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:39:39.003 --> 00:39:40.545
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.

00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:41.921
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!

00:39:43.132 --> 00:39:45.175
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.

00:39:45.259 --> 00:39:46.342
I don't want to see you in here again.

00:39:46.427 --> 00:39:49.137
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

00:40:10.951 --> 00:40:11.951
What?

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:13.328
You're George McFly.

00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:15.246
Yeah. Who are you?

00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:16.956
Say! Why do you let those boys

00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:18.541
push you around like that for?

00:40:18.626 --> 00:40:19.918
Well, they're bigger than me.

00:40:20.002 --> 00:40:22.629
Stand tall, boy. Have
some respect for yourself.

00:40:22.713 --> 00:40:24.923
Don't you know, if you let
people walk over you now,

00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:27.092
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

00:40:27.176 --> 00:40:28.593
Look at me. You think I'm gonna

00:40:28.677 --> 00:40:30.345
spend the rest of my
life in this slop house?

00:40:30.429 --> 00:40:32.222
Watch it, Goldie. No, sir!

00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:33.515
I'm gonna make something of myself.

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:34.808
I'm going to night school,

00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:37.102
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:39.062
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

00:40:39.146 --> 00:40:40.522
Yeah, I'm...

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.565
Mayor!

00:40:43.317 --> 00:40:47.237
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:48.822
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

00:40:48.906 --> 00:40:51.241
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.

00:40:51.325 --> 00:40:53.618
I'll be the most powerful
man in Hill Valley,

00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:55.495
and I'm going to clean up this town.

00:40:55.579 --> 00:40:58.540
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

00:41:01.085 --> 00:41:05.213
Mayor Goldie Wilson. I
like the sound of that.

00:41:17.726 --> 00:41:21.146
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

00:41:52.428 --> 00:41:54.470
He's a peeping Tom.

00:42:00.144 --> 00:42:01.186
Dad!

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.034
Hey, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Who are you?

00:42:18.037 --> 00:42:20.872
Stella! Another one of these damn kids

00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:22.332
jumped in front of my car!

00:42:23.334 --> 00:42:26.502
Come on out here! Help
me take him in the house!

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.010
Mom? That you?

00:42:35.054 --> 00:42:38.097
There, there, now. Just relax.

00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:43.770
You've been asleep for
almost nine hours now.

00:42:45.606 --> 00:42:48.066
I had a horrible nightmare.

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:53.655
I dreamed that I went back
in time. It was terrible.

00:42:54.907 --> 00:42:56.032
Well,

00:42:56.659 --> 00:43:00.119
you're safe and sound
now, back in good old 1955.

00:43:01.205 --> 00:43:02.622
1955?

00:43:07.419 --> 00:43:10.213
You're my... You're my...

00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:11.464
My name is Lorraine.

00:43:12.925 --> 00:43:14.092
Lorraine Baines.

00:43:14.176 --> 00:43:15.260
Yeah.

00:43:16.387 --> 00:43:19.055
But you're... You're so...

00:43:19.598 --> 00:43:22.642
You're so thin!

00:43:23.018 --> 00:43:26.437
Just relax, Calvin. You got
a big bruise on your head.

00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:32.568
Where are my pants?

00:43:32.653 --> 00:43:35.738
Over there, on my hope chest.

00:43:37.616 --> 00:43:40.243
I've never seen purple
underwear before, Calvin.

00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:43.830
Calvin? Why do you
keep calling me Calvin?

00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:46.833
Well, that is your name,
isn't it? Calvin Klein?

00:43:47.376 --> 00:43:50.044
It's written all over your underwear.

00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:52.839
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:56.884
No, actually, people call me Marty.

00:43:57.219 --> 00:43:58.344
Oh.

00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:01.389
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

00:44:02.308 --> 00:44:03.683
Marty.

00:44:05.102 --> 00:44:06.477
Klein.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.153
Do you mind if I sit here?

00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:16.446
No. Fine.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.906
No. Good. Fine. Good.

00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:23.119
That's a big bruise you have there.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.165
Lorraine, are you up there?

00:44:27.249 --> 00:44:29.250
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

00:44:29.335 --> 00:44:32.295
Quick! Put your pants back on!

00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:43.348
So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

00:44:43.432 --> 00:44:44.432
Excuse me?

00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:45.516
I guessed you're a sailor.

00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:47.769
That's why you wear that life preserver.

00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:49.354
Coast Guard.

00:44:49.438 --> 00:44:51.356
Sam, here's the young man

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.857
you hit with your car out there.

00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:54.025
He's all right. Thank God.

00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:56.319
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

00:44:56.403 --> 00:44:58.321
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

00:44:58.405 --> 00:44:59.989
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.

00:45:00.074 --> 00:45:01.491
Come in here to dinner.

00:45:01.575 --> 00:45:03.576
Now, let's see. You
already know Lorraine.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.497
This is Milton, this
is Sally, that's Toby,

00:45:07.581 --> 00:45:10.792
and over there in the
playpen is little baby Joey.

00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:14.462
So, you're my uncle Joey.

00:45:15.339 --> 00:45:17.715
Better get used to these bars, kid.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.928
Yes. Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

00:45:22.388 --> 00:45:23.721
He cries whenever we take him out,

00:45:23.806 --> 00:45:25.807
so we just leave him
in there all the time.

00:45:25.891 --> 00:45:28.101
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

00:45:28.185 --> 00:45:30.395
Listen, I really ought to...

00:45:30.479 --> 00:45:31.687
Sit here, Marty.

00:45:32.272 --> 00:45:34.148
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing

00:45:34.233 --> 00:45:36.692
and come in here and eat your dinner.

00:45:38.487 --> 00:45:40.238
Look at it roll.

00:45:40.322 --> 00:45:42.365
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.

00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:53.126
It's our first television set.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.836
Dad just picked it up today.

00:45:55.712 --> 00:45:57.797
Do you have a television?

00:45:57.881 --> 00:46:00.758
Well, yeah. You know
we have two of them.

00:46:00.843 --> 00:46:03.636
Wow! You must be rich.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.263
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

00:46:05.347 --> 00:46:07.807
Nobody has two television sets.

00:46:12.855 --> 00:46:15.148
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.

00:46:15.232 --> 00:46:16.649
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

00:46:16.733 --> 00:46:20.027
This is where Ralph dresses
up as a man from space.

00:46:20.112 --> 00:46:23.531
What do you mean, you've
seen this? It's brand-new.

00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:25.950
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

00:46:26.702 --> 00:46:28.494
What's a rerun?

00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:29.704
You'll find out.

00:46:30.205 --> 00:46:34.375
You know, Marty, you look so
familiar to me. Do I know your mother?

00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:37.837
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:39.505
Oh, then I
want to give her a call.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:41.257
I don't want her to worry about you.

00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:42.717
You can't.

00:46:43.594 --> 00:46:46.888
That is, nobody's home.

00:46:48.182 --> 00:46:49.265
Oh.

00:46:49.641 --> 00:46:50.766
Yet.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:52.393
Oh.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.898
Listen, do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

00:46:56.982 --> 00:46:58.483
It's on the other end of town.

00:46:58.567 --> 00:47:01.110
A block past Maple. East end of town.

00:47:01.195 --> 00:47:02.570
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:05.156
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

00:47:06.033 --> 00:47:08.034
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

00:47:08.118 --> 00:47:09.410
Mother?

00:47:10.037 --> 00:47:12.663
With Marty's parents out of town,

00:47:13.207 --> 00:47:15.625
don't you think he
ought to spend the night?

00:47:15.709 --> 00:47:18.127
I mean, after all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

00:47:18.337 --> 00:47:20.296
That's true, Marty.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.006
I think maybe you
should spend the night.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.633
I think you're our responsibility.

00:47:23.717 --> 00:47:25.343
Gee, I don't know.

00:47:25.427 --> 00:47:27.178
And he can sleep in my room.

00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:29.847
I gotta go! I gotta go!

00:47:29.932 --> 00:47:31.349
Thanks very much. It was wonderful.

00:47:31.433 --> 00:47:35.770
You were all great. See
you all later. Much later.

00:47:40.234 --> 00:47:43.027
He's a very strange young man.

00:47:43.111 --> 00:47:44.237
He's an idiot.

00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:48.282
Comes from upbringing. His
parents are probably idiots, too.

00:47:48.659 --> 00:47:49.867
Lorraine, you ever have a kid

00:47:49.952 --> 00:47:52.245
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

00:48:30.325 --> 00:48:31.409
Doc?

00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:33.869
Don't say a word.

00:48:35.163 --> 00:48:36.247
I don't wanna know your name.

00:48:36.331 --> 00:48:37.498
I don't want to know anything about you.

00:48:37.583 --> 00:48:39.333
Listen, Doc... Quiet!

00:48:39.418 --> 00:48:40.918
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

00:48:41.003 --> 00:48:43.170
Doc, you got to help... Quiet. Quiet.

00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:47.925
I'm going to read your thoughts.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.596
Let's see now. You've come
here from a great distance?

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.805
Yeah. Exactly.

00:48:52.889 --> 00:48:54.015
Don't tell me!

00:48:54.683 --> 00:48:56.100
You want me to buy a subscription

00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:57.518
to the Saturday Evening Post.

00:48:57.603 --> 00:48:58.644
No.

00:48:58.729 --> 00:49:00.187
Not a word. Not a word now!

00:49:00.272 --> 00:49:01.439
Quiet.

00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:07.194
Donations. You want
me to make a donation

00:49:07.279 --> 00:49:09.530
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:11.532
Doc.

00:49:13.035 --> 00:49:14.076
I'm from the future.

00:49:15.245 --> 00:49:18.372
I came here in a time
machine that you invented.

00:49:18.749 --> 00:49:23.544
Now, I need your help to
get back to the year 1985.

00:49:24.921 --> 00:49:26.505
My God.

00:49:30.927 --> 00:49:33.137
Do you know what this means?

00:49:34.806 --> 00:49:39.143
It means that this damn
thing doesn't work at all!

00:49:39.227 --> 00:49:41.145
Doc, you got to help
me. You are the only one

00:49:41.229 --> 00:49:43.564
who knows how your time machine works.

00:49:43.649 --> 00:49:47.485
Time machine? I haven't
invented any time machine.

00:49:49.404 --> 00:49:51.822
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

00:49:51.907 --> 00:49:55.076
Look at my driver's
license. Expires 1987.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.661
Look at my birthday,
for crying out loud!

00:49:56.745 --> 00:49:58.746
I haven't even been born yet.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.165
And look at this picture.

00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:03.250
It's my brother, my sister and me.

00:50:03.335 --> 00:50:06.629
Look at her sweatshirt,
Doc. "Class of 1984"?

00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:09.590
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

00:50:09.675 --> 00:50:11.926
They cut off your brother's hair.

00:50:12.469 --> 00:50:14.845
I'm telling the truth,
Doc. You got to believe me.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.014
Then tell me, future boy,

00:50:18.183 --> 00:50:21.936
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?

00:50:22.354 --> 00:50:23.396
Ronald Reagan.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.856
Ronald Reagan? The actor?

00:50:27.442 --> 00:50:29.985
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:33.531
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.

00:50:33.615 --> 00:50:34.699
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

00:50:34.783 --> 00:50:36.992
And Jack Benny is
secretary of the treasury.

00:50:37.077 --> 00:50:38.494
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

00:50:38.578 --> 00:50:40.663
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

00:50:40.747 --> 00:50:41.914
Good night, future boy!

00:50:41.998 --> 00:50:43.374
No, wait, Doc. Doc.

00:50:43.458 --> 00:50:46.252
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

00:50:46.336 --> 00:50:47.753
You told me the whole story.

00:50:47.838 --> 00:50:49.296
You were standing on your toilet

00:50:49.381 --> 00:50:50.423
and you were hanging a clock,

00:50:50.507 --> 00:50:52.717
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

00:50:52.801 --> 00:50:55.720
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

00:50:55.804 --> 00:50:59.807
which is what makes
time travel possible.

00:51:12.904 --> 00:51:17.074
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

00:51:27.586 --> 00:51:31.422
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

00:51:35.927 --> 00:51:37.720
The flux capacitor.

00:51:55.572 --> 00:51:56.864
It works!

00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:00.951
It works!

00:52:02.245 --> 00:52:04.955
I finally invent something that works!

00:52:05.707 --> 00:52:07.833
You bet your ass it works.

00:52:08.752 --> 00:52:11.796
Somehow we've got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.798
We've got to get you home!

00:52:14.466 --> 00:52:16.258
Okay, Doc, this is it.

00:52:18.053 --> 00:52:20.137
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

00:52:20.222 --> 00:52:23.641
Why, that's me! Look
at me! I'm an old man.

00:52:23.725 --> 00:52:24.975
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.144
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

00:52:27.229 --> 00:52:29.230
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

00:52:29.314 --> 00:52:31.315
What's on Earth is
this thing I'm wearing?

00:52:31.399 --> 00:52:33.567
This is a radiation suit.

00:52:33.652 --> 00:52:35.402
Radiation suit?

00:52:35.487 --> 00:52:38.489
Of course. 'Cause of all the
fallout from the atomic wars.

00:52:39.825 --> 00:52:42.493
This is truly amazing.

00:52:42.994 --> 00:52:45.830
A portable television studio.

00:52:45.914 --> 00:52:47.414
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

00:52:47.499 --> 00:52:49.667
He's gotta look good on television.

00:52:49.751 --> 00:52:52.169
Whoa. This is it. This is
the part coming up, Doc.

00:52:52.921 --> 00:52:54.380
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

00:52:54.464 --> 00:52:55.506
but I need a nuclear reaction

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.383
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

00:52:57.467 --> 00:52:59.260
What did I just say?

00:53:03.265 --> 00:53:04.348
This sucker's electrical,

00:53:04.432 --> 00:53:05.558
but I need a nuclear reaction

00:53:05.642 --> 00:53:07.351
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:09.770
1.21 gigawatts!

00:53:11.273 --> 00:53:13.482
1.21 gigawatts.

00:53:15.485 --> 00:53:17.111
Great Scott!

00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:21.490
What the hell is a gigawatt?

00:53:22.492 --> 00:53:26.579
How could I have been so
careless? 1.21 gigawatts!

00:53:26.663 --> 00:53:29.373
Tom, how am I going to
generate that kind of power?

00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:31.083
It can't be done, can it?

00:53:31.167 --> 00:53:33.919
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.881
I'm sure that in 1985,

00:53:36.965 --> 00:53:39.133
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

00:53:39.217 --> 00:53:41.969
but in 1955, it's a
little hard to come by.

00:53:42.053 --> 00:53:45.389
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you're stuck here.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.640
Whoa, whoa.

00:53:46.725 --> 00:53:51.145
Doc, stuck here? I can't be
stuck here. I got a life in 1985.

00:53:51.229 --> 00:53:52.313
I got a girl.

00:53:52.397 --> 00:53:53.439
Is she pretty?

00:53:53.982 --> 00:53:57.943
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

00:53:58.028 --> 00:54:02.323
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.

00:54:03.575 --> 00:54:06.160
Doc, you're my only hope.

00:54:06.828 --> 00:54:10.164
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating

00:54:10.248 --> 00:54:13.667
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

00:54:14.878 --> 00:54:16.003
What did you say?

00:54:16.087 --> 00:54:17.254
A bolt of lightning.

00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:18.339
Unfortunately, you never know

00:54:18.423 --> 00:54:21.550
when or where it's ever going to strike.

00:54:23.053 --> 00:54:24.428
We do now.

00:54:29.517 --> 00:54:33.103
This is it! This is the answer.

00:54:33.855 --> 00:54:36.273
It says here that a bolt of lightning

00:54:36.358 --> 00:54:37.358
is going to strike the clock tower

00:54:37.442 --> 00:54:40.694
at precisely 10:04 p.m.
Next Saturday night!

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.701
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.122
channel it into the flux capacitor,

00:54:53.416 --> 00:54:55.209
it just might work.

00:54:55.502 --> 00:54:59.755
Next Saturday night, we're
sending you back to the future!

00:55:00.715 --> 00:55:02.591
Okay, all right. Saturday's
good. Saturday's good.

00:55:02.676 --> 00:55:04.468
I can spend a week in 1955.

00:55:04.552 --> 00:55:06.303
I can hang out. You can show me around.

00:55:06.388 --> 00:55:08.222
Marty, that is completely
out of the question.

00:55:08.306 --> 00:55:09.640
You must not leave this house.

00:55:09.724 --> 00:55:11.725
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.395
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

00:55:14.479 --> 00:55:16.230
Do you understand?

00:55:17.107 --> 00:55:19.066
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

00:55:19.693 --> 00:55:20.901
Marty,

00:55:21.319 --> 00:55:24.780
have you interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

00:55:26.574 --> 00:55:29.702
Yeah, well, I might've sort
of bumped into my parents.

00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:31.328
Great Scott!

00:55:31.413 --> 00:55:33.706
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

00:55:37.085 --> 00:55:40.504
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:44.967
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

00:55:46.636 --> 00:55:48.679
Erased from existence.

00:55:53.268 --> 00:55:54.351
Whoa.

00:55:54.436 --> 00:55:57.187
They really cleaned this
place up. Looks brand-new.

00:55:57.272 --> 00:55:58.272
Now remember.

00:55:58.356 --> 00:55:59.606
According to my theory, you interfered

00:55:59.691 --> 00:56:00.858
with your parents' first meeting.

00:56:00.942 --> 00:56:02.192
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

00:56:02.277 --> 00:56:04.069
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:05.195
That's why your older brother's

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.530
disappearing from that photograph.

00:56:06.614 --> 00:56:08.824
Your sister will follow, and
unless you repair the damage,

00:56:08.908 --> 00:56:10.117
you'll be next.

00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:12.036
Sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.

00:56:13.246 --> 00:56:15.122
Which one's your pop?

00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:17.624
That's him.

00:56:18.084 --> 00:56:20.502
Okay. Okay, you guys.

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.382
Very funny. You guys
are being real mature.

00:56:25.467 --> 00:56:27.342
Maybe you were adopted.

00:56:27.427 --> 00:56:29.970
Okay, real mature, guys.

00:56:30.889 --> 00:56:32.264
Okay, pick up my books.

00:56:32.348 --> 00:56:33.390
McFly.

00:56:33.475 --> 00:56:35.184
That's Strickland.

00:56:35.643 --> 00:56:37.728
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

00:56:37.812 --> 00:56:40.564
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

00:56:40.648 --> 00:56:43.734
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:44.860
No.

00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:46.779
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

00:56:46.863 --> 00:56:48.155
I don't know, Doc.

00:56:48.239 --> 00:56:49.948
I guess she felt sorry for him

00:56:50.033 --> 00:56:52.367
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.912
Hit me with the car.

00:56:54.996 --> 00:56:56.997
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

00:56:57.082 --> 00:57:00.417
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

00:57:00.502 --> 00:57:01.752
Go to it, kid.

00:57:02.587 --> 00:57:05.422
Hey, George, buddy.

00:57:06.007 --> 00:57:08.383
I have been looking all over for you.

00:57:08.468 --> 00:57:11.428
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

00:57:11.513 --> 00:57:12.596
Oh.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.680
Yeah. Good.

00:57:13.765 --> 00:57:15.766
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

00:57:20.188 --> 00:57:21.772
Lorraine?

00:57:21.856 --> 00:57:22.981
Calvin!

00:57:24.442 --> 00:57:27.194
I'd like you to meet my
good friend George McFly.

00:57:27.278 --> 00:57:30.531
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:32.741
How's your head?

00:57:32.826 --> 00:57:34.159
Good. Fine.

00:57:34.244 --> 00:57:36.120
Oh. I've been so worried about you

00:57:36.204 --> 00:57:38.080
ever since you ran off the other night.

00:57:38.164 --> 00:57:39.623
Are you okay? Yeah.

00:57:40.875 --> 00:57:42.126
I'm sorry. I have to go.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:43.460
Come on!

00:57:44.295 --> 00:57:46.130
Isn't he a dreamboat?

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.844
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

00:57:51.928 --> 00:57:53.470
This is more serious than I thought.

00:57:53.555 --> 00:57:55.514
Apparently, your mother is
amorously infatuated with you,

00:57:55.598 --> 00:57:57.224
instead of your father.

00:57:57.851 --> 00:57:58.976
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.729
Are you trying to tell me that
my mother has got the hots for me?

00:58:02.814 --> 00:58:03.939
Precisely.

00:58:04.023 --> 00:58:05.065
Whoa. This is heavy.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.734
There's that word again. "Heavy."

00:58:07.819 --> 00:58:09.153
Why are things so heavy in the future?

00:58:09.237 --> 00:58:11.321
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?

00:58:11.406 --> 00:58:12.489
What? The only way

00:58:12.574 --> 00:58:13.991
we're going to get those
two to successfully mate

00:58:14.075 --> 00:58:15.450
is if they're alone together,

00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:18.162
so you've got to get your
father and mother to interact

00:58:18.246 --> 00:58:20.330
in some sort of social...

00:58:21.666 --> 00:58:23.208
What? You mean like a date? Right!

00:58:24.419 --> 00:58:25.502
What kind of date? I don't know.

00:58:25.587 --> 00:58:27.129
What do kids do in the '50s?

00:58:27.213 --> 00:58:30.007
They're your parents.
You must know them.

00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:31.216
What are their common interests?

00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:33.260
What do they like to do together?

00:58:34.262 --> 00:58:35.345
Nothing.

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:38.640
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

00:58:38.725 --> 00:58:40.684
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

00:58:40.768 --> 00:58:42.144
They're supposed to go to this.

00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:43.979
That's where they kiss
for the first time.

00:58:44.063 --> 00:58:45.439
All right, kid.

00:58:45.523 --> 00:58:47.107
You stick to your father like glue

00:58:47.192 --> 00:58:48.734
and make sure he takes
her to that dance.

00:58:49.444 --> 00:58:50.944
George, buddy.

00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:55.032
Remember that girl I
introduced you to, Lorraine?

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.706
What are you writing?

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:04.791
Uh... Stories.

00:59:05.627 --> 00:59:09.171
Science fiction stories about visitors

00:59:09.631 --> 00:59:12.883
coming down to Earth from other planets.

00:59:14.928 --> 00:59:18.597
Get out of town! I didn't
know you did anything creative.

00:59:19.098 --> 00:59:20.224
Let me read some.

00:59:20.308 --> 00:59:21.892
Oh. No, no, no, no.

00:59:21.976 --> 00:59:24.811
I never let anybody read my stories.

00:59:25.563 --> 00:59:26.813
Why not?

00:59:27.232 --> 00:59:29.107
Well, what if they didn't like them?

00:59:29.192 --> 00:59:31.652
What if they told me I was no good?

00:59:33.738 --> 00:59:36.573
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

00:59:37.992 --> 00:59:40.577
No. No, not hard at all.

00:59:41.788 --> 00:59:44.331
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.334
She really likes you.

00:59:48.294 --> 00:59:51.255
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

00:59:51.339 --> 00:59:53.090
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

00:59:53.174 --> 00:59:54.341
Really? Oh, yeah.

00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:57.511
All you got to do is go
over there and ask her.

00:59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.597
What? Right here, right
now, in the cafeteria?

01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:01.765
What if she said no?

01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:05.310
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:10.023
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

01:00:11.359 --> 01:00:12.526
Who?

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.445
Biff.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.115
Don't kid around. Come on.

01:00:18.199 --> 01:00:19.449
I'm gonna leave.

01:00:19.534 --> 01:00:21.410
You want it. You know you want it.

01:00:21.494 --> 01:00:23.620
You know you want me to give it to you.

01:00:23.705 --> 01:00:26.290
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:30.294
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

01:00:30.378 --> 01:00:32.212
Get your meat hooks off of me.

01:00:32.297 --> 01:00:33.338
You heard her.

01:00:33.423 --> 01:00:36.800
She said, get your meat hooks off.

01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:39.469
Please.

01:00:40.305 --> 01:00:42.389
So what's it to you, butthead?

01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:45.767
You know, you been looking for a fight.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:59.740
Since you're new here, I'm
going to cut you a break, today.

01:01:01.576 --> 01:01:05.329
So, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here.

01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:19.259
George!

01:01:20.595 --> 01:01:22.637
Why do you keep following me around?

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:25.682
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:27.517
if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,

01:01:27.602 --> 01:01:29.102
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:30.645
But I can't go to the dance.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.857
I'll miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

01:01:33.941 --> 01:01:37.319
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine
wants to go with you.

01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:38.528
Give her a break.

01:01:38.613 --> 01:01:42.783
Look, I'm just not ready to
ask Lorraine out to the dance,

01:01:43.576 --> 01:01:46.787
and not you or anybody
else on this planet

01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:49.456
is going to make me change my mind.

01:01:56.255 --> 01:01:58.256
Science Fiction Theatre.

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:30.872
Who are you?

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:38.505
Silence, Earthling.

01:02:39.966 --> 01:02:42.426
My name is Darth Vader.

01:02:47.473 --> 01:02:50.934
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.187
Marty!

01:02:57.358 --> 01:02:58.442
Marty! Marty!

01:02:58.526 --> 01:02:59.609
Hey, George, buddy.

01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:02.070
You weren't at school. What
have you been doing all day?

01:03:02.155 --> 01:03:05.073
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

01:03:05.158 --> 01:03:06.616
I have to ask Lorraine out,

01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:07.784
but I don't know how to do it.

01:03:07.869 --> 01:03:10.704
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.831
God! How do you...

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:17.377
What made you change your mind, George?

01:03:17.462 --> 01:03:20.380
Last night, Darth Vader
came down from Planet Vulcan

01:03:20.465 --> 01:03:24.384
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:27.554
Let's just keep this brain-melting
stuff to ourselves, okay?

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:28.763
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:31.141
All right, okay. There she is, George.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:32.976
Now just go in there and invite her.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.644
Okay. But I don't know what to say.

01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:35.812
Just say anything, George.

01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:39.941
Say whatever's natural, the first
thing that comes into your mind.

01:03:40.568 --> 01:03:42.486
Nothing's coming to my mind.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.279
Jesus, George, it's a
wonder I was even born.

01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:45.322
What? What?

01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:46.907
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

01:03:47.492 --> 01:03:51.578
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:53.580
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.499
you have ever seen in the world.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:57.542
Girls like that stuff.

01:03:57.919 --> 01:03:58.919
What are you doing, George?

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:00.795
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.380
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:03.924
Can you take care of that? Right.

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:25.362
Lou, give me a milk.

01:04:26.739 --> 01:04:28.114
Chocolate.

01:04:44.298 --> 01:04:49.386
Lorraine. My density
has popped me to you.

01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:51.972
What?

01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:53.223
Oh.

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:56.726
What I meant to say was...

01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:59.896
Wait a minute. Don't I
know you from somewhere?

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:01.439
Yes.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:05.652
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

01:05:06.279 --> 01:05:07.946
I'm your density.

01:05:08.948 --> 01:05:10.240
I mean,

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:13.076
your destiny.

01:05:14.287 --> 01:05:15.370
Oh.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.497
Hey, McFly.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:24.838
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:29.551
Well, it's going to cost you.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:32.178
How much money you got on you?

01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:34.639
How much do you want, Biff?

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:44.441
All right, punk.

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:45.525
Now I'm going to...

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.277
Whoa, whoa, Biff. What's that?

01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:57.037
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:58.246
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:00.123
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

01:06:00.207 --> 01:06:01.374
Hey!

01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:04.628
I'll get it
back to you, all right?

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:07.380
You broke it!

01:06:07.715 --> 01:06:08.798
Come back here!

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:12.761
Wow. Look at him go!

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:15.889
Get him!

01:06:29.236 --> 01:06:31.404
To the car! Go! Go!

01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:38.953
What's that thing he's on?

01:06:39.038 --> 01:06:40.497
It's a board with wheels.

01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:42.165
He's an absolute dream.

01:06:42.249 --> 01:06:43.458
Come on, come on!

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:45.085
Look out for the car!

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.102
Whoa!

01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:20.245
I'm going to ram him.

01:07:27.628 --> 01:07:28.795
Shit!

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:41.474
Ooh!

01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:55.739
Thanks a lot, kid.

01:07:56.866 --> 01:07:59.284
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:00.410
Where does he come from?

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:02.370
Yeah, where does he live?

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.666
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:13.840
Oh, my God.

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:17.343
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:19.095
Run for it, Marty!

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:25.185
Oh, my God.

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:28.897
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

01:08:28.981 --> 01:08:30.356
Run for it, Marty!

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:32.734
Doc?

01:08:33.486 --> 01:08:36.446
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

01:08:37.406 --> 01:08:39.949
Fascinating device, this video unit.

01:08:40.951 --> 01:08:42.619
Listen, Doc.

01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:43.661
You know, there's something

01:08:43.746 --> 01:08:44.913
I haven't told you about the night

01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:46.331
we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:47.707
No man should know too
much about his own destiny.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.167
You don't understand. I do understand.

01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:50.460
If I know too much about my own future,

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:51.961
I can endanger my own existence.

01:08:52.046 --> 01:08:54.380
Just as you've endangered yours.

01:08:56.342 --> 01:08:58.259
You're right. Now...

01:08:58.344 --> 01:09:01.221
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.056
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.475
I didn't have time to build
it to scale or paint it.

01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:07.477
It's good. Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:08.771 --> 01:09:09.979
Okay, now.

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:12.273
We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

01:09:12.358 --> 01:09:14.192
from the top of the clock tower

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:15.902
down, suspending it over the street

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:17.570
between these two lamp posts.

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:20.657
Meanwhile, we've
outfitted the time vehicle

01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:22.200
with this big pole and hook,

01:09:22.284 --> 01:09:25.245
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

01:09:26.163 --> 01:09:30.834
At the calculated moment, you
start off from down the street,

01:09:30.918 --> 01:09:32.168
driving directly toward the cable,

01:09:32.253 --> 01:09:35.171
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

01:09:35.506 --> 01:09:38.883
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. This Saturday night,

01:09:38.968 --> 01:09:42.595
lightning will strike the clock
tower, electrifying the cable

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.931
just as the connecting
hook makes contact

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:48.643
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:51.187
and sending you back to 1985.

01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:53.314
All right, now. Watch this.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.316
You wind up the car and release it.

01:09:57.111 --> 01:09:59.320
I'll simulate the lightning.

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:08.788
Ready.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:19.674
Set.

01:10:24.722 --> 01:10:25.972
Release.

01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:46.534
You're instilling me with
a lot of confidence, Doc.

01:10:46.619 --> 01:10:47.994
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the lightning.

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:50.663
You take care of your pop.

01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:54.834
By the way, what happened
today? Did he ask her out?

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:56.044
I think so.

01:10:56.128 --> 01:10:57.170
What did she say?

01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:07.597
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:09.933
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.740
Hi, Cal... Marty.

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:27.659
Mom. Lorraine.

01:11:29.203 --> 01:11:31.412
How did you know I was here?

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.873
I followed you.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:36.709
Oh. This is my doc...

01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:39.879
My uncle, Doc Brown.

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:42.465
Hi. Hi.

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:48.721
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

01:11:49.098 --> 01:11:53.309
but I was kind of
wondering if you'd ask me

01:11:53.394 --> 01:11:57.230
to the Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.111
Wow, you mean... You
mean nobody's asked you?

01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:06.864
No. Not yet.

01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:10.118
What about George?

01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:11.995
George McFly?

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.543
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:23.548
Well, I think a man should be strong,

01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:27.719
so he can stand up for himself

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:31.014
and protect the woman he loves.

01:12:35.728 --> 01:12:37.103
Don't you?

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:39.689
Yeah.

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:42.150
I still don't understand.

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:45.319
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

01:12:45.404 --> 01:12:48.156
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.908
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:52.910
She just doesn't know it yet.

01:12:52.995 --> 01:12:53.995
That's why we got to show her

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:56.039
that you, George McFly, are a fighter.

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:58.041
You're somebody who's
gonna stand up for yourself,

01:12:58.125 --> 01:12:59.584
somebody who's gonna protect her.

01:12:59.668 --> 01:13:02.879
Yeah, but I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:05.715
Look, you're not going to
be picking a fight, Dad.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:08.009
Daddy-o.

01:13:08.093 --> 01:13:10.386
You're coming to her rescue, right?

01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:11.637
Okay, let's go over the plan again.

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:13.473
8:55, where are you going to be?

01:13:13.557 --> 01:13:15.141
I'm going to be at the dance.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.267
Right. And where am I going to be?

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.352
You're gonna be in the car with her.

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:19.896
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.397
she's going to get very angry with me.

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.900
Why is she going to get angry with you?

01:13:23.984 --> 01:13:26.319
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:28.654
when guys take advantage of them.

01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:32.909
You mean you're going
to go touch her on her...

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:35.453
No. No, George, look.

01:13:36.288 --> 01:13:38.247
It's just an act, right?

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.043
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:45.671
You see us struggling in the car.

01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:49.258
You walk up, you open
the door, and you say...

01:13:50.886 --> 01:13:52.637
Your line, George.

01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:55.098
Oh!

01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:58.601
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

01:14:00.938 --> 01:14:02.271
You really think I ought to swear?

01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:03.356
Yes, definitely.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.066
God damn it, George, swear.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:07.151
Okay. So, now you come up.

01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:08.361
You punch me in the stomach.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:10.238
I'm out for the count, right?

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:13.533
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:15.827
You make it sound so easy.

01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:18.371
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:19.705
George, there's nothing to be scared of.

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:22.333
All it takes is a
little self-confidence.

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:25.128
You know, if you put your mind to it,

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:26.671
you can accomplish anything.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:31.509
...Hill Valley area
weather this Saturday night.

01:14:31.593 --> 01:14:34.595
Mostly clear, with
some scattered clouds.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.389
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.391
Are you sure about this storm?

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:43.396
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:46.566
You know, Marty, I'm going
to be very sad to see you go.

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:47.859
You've really made a
difference in my life.

01:14:47.943 --> 01:14:50.069
You've given me something to shoot for.

01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:54.323
Just knowing that I'm going
to be around to see 1985.

01:14:54.408 --> 01:14:56.325
That I'm going to succeed in this!

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.954
That I'm going to have a
chance to travel through time!

01:15:05.419 --> 01:15:08.087
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

01:15:08.172 --> 01:15:11.132
about everything that's
happened in the past few days.

01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:13.801
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:16.971
I'm really going to miss you.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:22.518
Doc, about the future...

01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:23.686
No!

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:26.689
Marty! We've already agreed

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.065
that having information about the future

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:29.609
can be extremely dangerous.

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.194
Even if your intentions are good,

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:33.237
it can backfire drastically.

01:15:34.489 --> 01:15:35.698
Whatever you've got to tell me,

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:38.868
I'll find out through the
natural course of time.

01:15:39.912 --> 01:15:41.871
"Dear Dr. Brown.

01:15:42.623 --> 01:15:45.082
"On the night that I go back in time,

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:47.293
"you will be

01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:50.171
"shot by terrorists.

01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:53.758
"Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

01:15:53.842 --> 01:15:56.302
"to prevent this terrible disaster.

01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:59.430
"Your friend,

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:01.724
"Marty."

01:16:11.151 --> 01:16:14.111
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

01:16:14.196 --> 01:16:17.114
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

01:16:18.951 --> 01:16:19.951
What you got under here?

01:16:20.035 --> 01:16:21.035
No! Don't touch that!

01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:23.913
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:26.207
You got a permit for that?

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:27.583
Of course I do.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:38.177
Just a second. Let me
see if I can find it here.

01:17:30.314 --> 01:17:34.900
Do you mind if we park for a while?

01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:38.112
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:39.196
Huh?

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:41.991
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:43.993
It's not like I've never parked before.

01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:46.078
What?

01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:49.623
Marty, you seem so
nervous. Is something wrong?

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:53.002
No.

01:17:57.758 --> 01:18:00.176
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

01:18:00.635 --> 01:18:02.970
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

01:18:03.055 --> 01:18:05.973
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

01:18:06.058 --> 01:18:07.016
Why not?

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.142
Because you...

01:18:08.894 --> 01:18:11.645
You might regret it later in life.

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:14.607
Marty, don't be such a square.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.609
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

01:18:21.782 --> 01:18:23.616
Jeez, you smoke, too?

01:18:24.993 --> 01:18:27.995
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

01:18:39.216 --> 01:18:40.549
We're going to take a little break,

01:18:40.634 --> 01:18:42.134
but we'll be back in a while,

01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:44.804
so don't nobody go nowhere.

01:19:01.196 --> 01:19:04.490
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:07.118
Lorraine.

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:12.206
Have you ever been in a situation

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:14.083
where you knew you had
to act a certain way,

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:16.335
but when you got there, you didn't know

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.170
if you could go through with it?

01:19:18.255 --> 01:19:21.715
You mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.050
Sort of.

01:19:23.844 --> 01:19:26.512
I think I know exactly what you mean.

01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:28.639
You do?

01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:31.767
You know what I do in those situations?

01:19:31.852 --> 01:19:32.977
What?

01:19:33.061 --> 01:19:34.103
I don't worry.

01:19:52.122 --> 01:19:55.749
This is all wrong. I
don't know what it is.

01:19:57.419 --> 01:20:00.880
But when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing

01:20:02.674 --> 01:20:04.049
my brother.

01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:07.052
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

01:20:07.137 --> 01:20:11.140
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:14.685
Somebody's coming.

01:20:18.607 --> 01:20:22.818
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car, you son of a bitch.

01:20:22.903 --> 01:20:26.197
And I'm going to take it
out of your ass. Hold him.

01:20:27.115 --> 01:20:29.533
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:32.828
Well, look-ey what we have here.

01:20:35.624 --> 01:20:39.251
No, no! You're staying right
here with me. Come on, Lorraine.

01:20:39.336 --> 01:20:40.377
Let me go!

01:20:40.462 --> 01:20:41.712
Leave her alone, you bastard!

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:43.631
Take him in back, all
right? I'll be right there.

01:20:43.715 --> 01:20:46.800
Just admit that
you want it. Come on.

01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:49.178
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

01:20:55.936 --> 01:20:57.061
Hey, let's put him in there.

01:20:57.145 --> 01:20:58.521
Yeah!

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.274
That's for messing up my hair.

01:21:02.359 --> 01:21:04.443
What the hell are you doing to my car?

01:21:04.528 --> 01:21:06.987
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:12.159
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.287
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

01:21:15.372 --> 01:21:17.957
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.875
Get home to your mama, boy.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.043
Biff!

01:21:21.127 --> 01:21:22.211
Hurry, Biff!

01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:24.588
Let me out of here!

01:21:26.383 --> 01:21:27.883
Reginald, where are your keys?

01:21:27.968 --> 01:21:30.135
The keys are in the trunk.

01:21:30.595 --> 01:21:31.720
Say that again?

01:21:31.805 --> 01:21:33.639
I said, the keys are in here.

01:21:47.362 --> 01:21:48.654
Come on!

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.492
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:56.620
Oh.

01:21:56.705 --> 01:21:59.331
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.668
George, help me! Please!

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:05.629
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

01:22:06.673 --> 01:22:07.673
Please, George.

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:08.841
Are you deaf, McFly?

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:11.010
Close the door and beat it.

01:22:13.597 --> 01:22:17.182
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:19.727
All right, McFly.

01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:26.609
You're asking for it, and
now you're going to get it.

01:22:28.028 --> 01:22:29.486
Biff, stop it!

01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:32.781
Biff, you'll break his arm!

01:22:34.284 --> 01:22:35.534
Biff, no!

01:22:36.369 --> 01:22:38.662
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:42.291
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:43.834
Whose are these? Mine.

01:22:43.918 --> 01:22:45.836
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

01:22:47.172 --> 01:22:49.048
You're going to break his arm!

01:22:49.716 --> 01:22:52.843
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

01:22:52.927 --> 01:22:55.387
Let him go! Let him go!

01:23:28.546 --> 01:23:30.130
Are you okay?

01:23:50.193 --> 01:23:52.528
Who is that guy?

01:23:52.612 --> 01:23:53.821
That's George McFly.

01:23:57.659 --> 01:23:59.702
That's George McFly?

01:23:59.786 --> 01:24:01.078
Excuse me.

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.841
The storm.

01:24:15.802 --> 01:24:18.512
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:20.013
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:21.223
He can't play with his hand like that,

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:22.433
and we can't play without him.

01:24:22.517 --> 01:24:24.977
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:27.229
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

01:24:27.313 --> 01:24:29.022
And if there's no
music, they can't dance.

01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:30.399
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:32.860
If they can't kiss, they can't
fall in love and I'm history.

01:24:32.944 --> 01:24:34.111
Hey, man, the dance is over

01:24:34.195 --> 01:24:36.739
unless you know somebody
else that can play the guitar.

01:24:44.122 --> 01:24:46.540
This is for all you lovers out there.

01:24:49.127 --> 01:24:53.172
Earth angel, Earth angel

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:56.550
Will you be mine?

01:24:57.135 --> 01:24:59.803
My darling dear

01:25:00.597 --> 01:25:02.431
George, aren't you going to kiss me?

01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:04.016
I don't know.

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:07.936
Scram, McFly. I'm cutting in.

01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:18.906
Earth angel, Earth angel

01:25:19.574 --> 01:25:21.408
The one I adore

01:25:21.493 --> 01:25:23.494
Hey, boy, you all right?

01:25:24.621 --> 01:25:26.079
I can't play.

01:25:26.164 --> 01:25:27.247
George!

01:25:44.724 --> 01:25:45.974
George!

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:48.560
George.

01:25:51.606 --> 01:25:53.023
Excuse me.

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:05.077
The vision of your happiness

01:26:07.247 --> 01:26:10.457
Earth angel, Earth angel

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:14.336
Please be mine

01:26:14.921 --> 01:26:17.047
My darling dear

01:26:17.382 --> 01:26:20.425
Love you for all time

01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:24.471
I'm just a fool

01:26:25.557 --> 01:26:28.600
A fool in love

01:26:29.853 --> 01:26:33.272
with you

01:26:40.113 --> 01:26:44.032
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

01:26:44.117 --> 01:26:46.034
No. I got to go.

01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:49.621
Come on, man. Let's do
something that really cooks.

01:26:49.706 --> 01:26:52.499
Something that cooks.

01:26:57.881 --> 01:26:58.922
All right.

01:26:59.007 --> 01:27:00.007
All right!

01:27:04.012 --> 01:27:05.387
All right.

01:27:06.306 --> 01:27:09.725
All right, this is an oldie, but...

01:27:11.728 --> 01:27:15.105
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:19.401
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

01:27:19.485 --> 01:27:22.529
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

01:27:39.464 --> 01:27:42.299
Way down in
Louisiana Down in New Orleans

01:27:42.383 --> 01:27:45.135
Way back up in the woods
among the evergreens

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.055
There stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood

01:27:48.181 --> 01:27:50.766
Where lived a country boy
name of Johnny B. Goode

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.518
He never ever learned
to read or write so well

01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:56.188
He could play the guitar
just like he's ringing a bell

01:27:56.314 --> 01:28:00.275
Go, go Go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.861
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

01:28:03.738 --> 01:28:05.280
Go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:05.365 --> 01:28:07.991
Hey, George, I heard you
laid out Biff. Nice going.

01:28:08.076 --> 01:28:10.369
George, you ever think of
running for class president?

01:28:10.453 --> 01:28:12.871
Johnny B. Goode

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:17.876
Go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:20.629
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:23.465
Go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:25.759
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

01:28:27.345 --> 01:28:29.221
Johnny B. Goode

01:28:31.474 --> 01:28:34.309
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

01:28:34.394 --> 01:28:36.979
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

01:28:37.063 --> 01:28:39.815
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:41.775
Well, listen to this.

01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:54.306
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.267
But your kids are going to love it.

01:30:01.522 --> 01:30:02.898
Lorraine.

01:30:02.982 --> 01:30:05.567
Marty, that was very interesting music.

01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:07.235
Yeah.

01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:09.237
I hope you don't mind,

01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:11.364
but George asked if
he could take me home.

01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:14.534
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.

01:30:14.619 --> 01:30:16.036
I had a feeling about you two.

01:30:16.496 --> 01:30:18.455
I have a feeling, too.

01:30:18.831 --> 01:30:20.207
Listen, I got to go,

01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:25.003
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been educational.

01:30:26.047 --> 01:30:28.507
Marty, will we ever see you again?

01:30:29.717 --> 01:30:30.926
I guarantee it.

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:34.429
Well, Marty, I want to thank
you for all your good advice.

01:30:34.514 --> 01:30:36.848
I'll never forget it.

01:30:37.558 --> 01:30:39.142
Right, George.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.022
Well, good luck, you guys.

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:46.691
Oh!

01:30:48.027 --> 01:30:51.947
One other thing. If
you guys ever have kids,

01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:54.449
and one of them, when
he's eight years old,

01:30:54.534 --> 01:30:57.536
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

01:30:58.871 --> 01:31:00.497
go easy on him.

01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:02.791
Okay.

01:31:07.672 --> 01:31:10.507
Marty. Such a nice name.

01:31:16.472 --> 01:31:18.598
Damn! Where is that kid?

01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:23.061
Damn!

01:31:25.523 --> 01:31:26.898
Damn! Damn!

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.617
You're late! Do you
have no concept of time?

01:31:37.702 --> 01:31:40.078
Hey, come on. I had to change.

01:31:40.163 --> 01:31:43.081
Do you think I'm going
back in that zoot suit?

01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:45.834
The old man really
came through. It worked.

01:31:45.918 --> 01:31:48.003
He laid out Biff in one punch.

01:31:48.087 --> 01:31:49.171
I didn't know he had it in him.

01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:52.465
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

01:31:53.843 --> 01:31:55.010
Never?

01:31:55.094 --> 01:31:56.845
No. Why? What's the matter?

01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:01.641
All right! Let's set
your destination time.

01:32:06.397 --> 01:32:08.732
This is the exact time you left.

01:32:09.108 --> 01:32:12.569
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:17.657
It'll be like you never left.

01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:23.830
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

01:32:23.915 --> 01:32:25.790
That's where you'll start from.

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:28.210
I've calculated the precise distance,

01:32:28.294 --> 01:32:30.962
taking into account
the acceleration speed

01:32:31.047 --> 01:32:32.797
and wind resistance retroactive

01:32:32.882 --> 01:32:35.508
from the moment the lightning strikes,

01:32:35.593 --> 01:32:40.096
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

01:32:40.473 --> 01:32:42.849
When this alarm goes
off, you hit the gas.

01:32:42.934 --> 01:32:44.017
Right.

01:32:50.816 --> 01:32:53.860
Well, I guess that's everything.

01:32:58.074 --> 01:32:59.532
Thanks.

01:32:59.617 --> 01:33:00.825
Thank you.

01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.958
See you in about 30 years.

01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:11.002
I hope so.

01:33:12.672 --> 01:33:14.214
Don't worry!

01:33:14.882 --> 01:33:16.591
As long as you hit that wire

01:33:16.676 --> 01:33:19.761
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:22.847
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:26.434
everything will be fine.

01:33:26.519 --> 01:33:27.686
Right.

01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:38.530
What's the meaning of this?

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:40.282
You'll find out in 30 years.

01:33:40.366 --> 01:33:42.450
It's about the future, isn't it?

01:33:42.535 --> 01:33:43.618
It's information about the future.

01:33:43.703 --> 01:33:45.245
Wait a minute.

01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:47.247
I warned you about this, kid.

01:33:47.331 --> 01:33:50.166
The consequences could be disastrous!

01:33:50.251 --> 01:33:52.669
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

01:33:52.753 --> 01:33:54.337
Your life depends on it!

01:33:54.422 --> 01:33:55.588
No!

01:33:56.048 --> 01:33:59.384
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

01:33:59.719 --> 01:34:01.678
In that case, I'll
tell you straight out.

01:34:06.434 --> 01:34:07.851
Great Scott!

01:34:15.776 --> 01:34:18.820
You get the cable, I'll
throw the rope down to you.

01:34:18.904 --> 01:34:20.697
Right! I got it!

01:34:54.899 --> 01:34:56.149
Doc!

01:35:03.783 --> 01:35:05.367
Come on, come on. Let's go!

01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:08.119
All right! Take it up!

01:35:11.332 --> 01:35:12.457
Go!

01:35:19.507 --> 01:35:20.507
Doc!

01:35:20.591 --> 01:35:21.633
What?

01:35:21.801 --> 01:35:25.136
I have to tell you about the future.

01:35:25.346 --> 01:35:26.388
What?

01:35:26.472 --> 01:35:29.724
I have to tell you about the future!

01:35:29.809 --> 01:35:31.142
What?

01:35:31.227 --> 01:35:36.064
On the night I go back
in time, you get...

01:35:39.568 --> 01:35:40.819
Doc!

01:35:50.079 --> 01:35:51.287
Go!

01:35:52.164 --> 01:35:53.248
No, Doc!

01:35:53.332 --> 01:35:54.582
Look at the time!

01:35:54.667 --> 01:35:58.670
You've got less than four
minutes. Please, hurry!

01:36:10.266 --> 01:36:11.599
Yeah!

01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:08.114
Damn it, Doc! Why did you
have to tear up that letter?

01:37:08.199 --> 01:37:10.158
If I only had more time.

01:37:13.162 --> 01:37:15.538
Wait a minute. I got
all the time I want.

01:37:15.623 --> 01:37:19.209
I got a time machine. I can
just go back early and warn him.

01:37:19.293 --> 01:37:21.836
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

01:37:23.964 --> 01:37:28.676
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

01:37:29.136 --> 01:37:31.262
Engine running. All right.

01:37:34.058 --> 01:37:36.100
No. No, no.

01:37:37.645 --> 01:37:39.854
Come on. Not this
time. Come on. Come on.

01:38:50.301 --> 01:38:51.593
Come on.

01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:56.806
Here we go. Here we
go. This time. Come on.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.977
Please. Please. Come on!

01:40:39.326 --> 01:40:40.702
Doc.

01:42:16.882 --> 01:42:18.966
Crazy drunk driver.

01:42:29.478 --> 01:42:30.895
Whoo!

01:42:34.107 --> 01:42:36.359
All right. Fred.

01:42:37.861 --> 01:42:40.655
You look great. Everything looks great.

01:42:41.907 --> 01:42:45.910
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

01:42:49.581 --> 01:42:54.335
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.433
Libyans.

01:43:32.082 --> 01:43:33.124
No!

01:43:34.459 --> 01:43:35.960
You bastard!

01:43:49.308 --> 01:43:50.641
Go!

01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:27.136
Doc! Doc!

01:44:32.601 --> 01:44:34.769
No! No!

01:44:49.701 --> 01:44:51.202
You're alive.

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.046
Bulletproof vest?

01:45:03.382 --> 01:45:05.049
How did you know?

01:45:05.842 --> 01:45:08.260
I never got a chance to tell you.

01:45:21.817 --> 01:45:25.861
What about all that talk about
screwing up future events?

01:45:25.946 --> 01:45:28.030
The space-time continuum?

01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:31.409
Well, I figured, what the hell?

01:45:41.628 --> 01:45:43.587
So, how far ahead are you going?

01:45:43.672 --> 01:45:46.674
About 30 years. It's
a nice, round number.

01:45:46.758 --> 01:45:51.220
Look me up when you get there,
all right? Guess I'll be about 47.

01:45:51.304 --> 01:45:52.555
I will.

01:45:52.973 --> 01:45:54.390
Take care.

01:45:55.142 --> 01:45:56.350
You, too.

01:45:56.435 --> 01:45:58.769
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:02.273
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

01:46:02.983 --> 01:46:04.275
You bet.

01:47:09.257 --> 01:47:10.883
What a nightmare.

01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:25.189
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

01:47:25.273 --> 01:47:27.358
Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

01:47:27.442 --> 01:47:28.984
second of all, somebody named Greg

01:47:29.069 --> 01:47:30.945
or Craig called you
just a little while ago.

01:47:31.029 --> 01:47:32.613
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

01:47:32.697 --> 01:47:35.407
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

01:47:35.492 --> 01:47:36.617
Hey.

01:47:37.661 --> 01:47:39.370
What the hell is this?

01:47:40.122 --> 01:47:41.205
Breakfast.

01:47:41.706 --> 01:47:44.125
Did you sleep in your
clothes again last night?

01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:45.543
Yeah. I...

01:47:46.545 --> 01:47:49.088
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

01:47:49.381 --> 01:47:52.216
Marty, I always wear
a suit to the office.

01:47:53.927 --> 01:47:55.761
You all right? Yeah.

01:47:56.555 --> 01:47:57.638
I think we
need a rematch, George.

01:47:57.722 --> 01:47:58.764
A rematch?

01:47:58.849 --> 01:47:59.890
Why? Were you cheating?

01:47:59.975 --> 01:48:00.975
No.

01:48:01.059 --> 01:48:02.935
Hello. Good morning.

01:48:05.021 --> 01:48:06.522
Mom! Dad!

01:48:06.898 --> 01:48:08.482
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?

01:48:08.567 --> 01:48:12.570
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

01:48:12.904 --> 01:48:15.447
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

01:48:16.908 --> 01:48:18.993
Good morning, sleepyhead.

01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:21.287
Good morning, Dave. Linda.

01:48:21.371 --> 01:48:22.746
Good morning, Mom.

01:48:22.831 --> 01:48:25.332
Marty, I almost
forgot. Jennifer Parker called.

01:48:25.417 --> 01:48:29.044
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

01:48:29.588 --> 01:48:31.589
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

01:48:31.673 --> 01:48:33.632
What? What, Ma?

01:48:33.717 --> 01:48:35.092
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?

01:48:35.177 --> 01:48:37.845
You've been planning it for two weeks.

01:48:37.929 --> 01:48:40.598
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

01:48:40.682 --> 01:48:41.807
The car's wrecked.

01:48:41.892 --> 01:48:43.475
Wrecked? Wrecked?

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.685
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

01:48:44.769 --> 01:48:45.769
Quiet down.

01:48:45.854 --> 01:48:47.354
I'm sure the car is fine.

01:48:47.439 --> 01:48:49.690
Why am I always the last
one to know about these things?

01:48:49.774 --> 01:48:52.860
See? There's Biff out
there waxing it right now.

01:48:53.278 --> 01:48:54.695
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that

01:48:54.779 --> 01:48:57.615
we get two coats of wax
this time, not just one.

01:48:57.699 --> 01:48:59.283
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

01:48:59.367 --> 01:49:01.952
Now, Biff, don't con me.

01:49:03.455 --> 01:49:05.497
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

01:49:05.582 --> 01:49:08.667
I meant I was just
starting on the second coat.

01:49:09.753 --> 01:49:13.589
Biff. What a character. Always
trying to get away with something.

01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:17.051
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.

01:49:17.135 --> 01:49:19.220
Although, if it wasn't for him...

01:49:19.304 --> 01:49:20.888
We never would have fallen in love.

01:49:20.972 --> 01:49:22.431
That's right.

01:49:22.974 --> 01:49:25.684
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

01:49:25.769 --> 01:49:28.562
Oh, hi, Marty. I think
it's your new book.

01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:34.985
Honey! Your first novel.

01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:36.111
Like I've always told you,

01:49:36.196 --> 01:49:39.114
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

01:49:39.199 --> 01:49:41.700
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.

01:49:41.785 --> 01:49:43.577
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

01:49:44.162 --> 01:49:45.329
Keys?

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.305
How about a ride, mister?

01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:04.515
Jennifer.

01:50:05.475 --> 01:50:09.603
Oh, are you a sight for sore
eyes! Let me look at you.

01:50:10.355 --> 01:50:13.232
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

01:50:13.316 --> 01:50:14.733
I haven't.

01:50:15.318 --> 01:50:18.570
You okay? Is everything all right?

01:50:21.866 --> 01:50:22.992
Oh, yeah.

01:50:25.203 --> 01:50:26.996
Everything is great.

01:50:41.219 --> 01:50:45.472
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

01:50:46.266 --> 01:50:47.474
Where?

01:50:47.559 --> 01:50:48.726
Back to the future.

01:50:53.356 --> 01:50:55.482
Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?

01:50:56.484 --> 01:50:57.568
I need fuel.

01:51:01.031 --> 01:51:03.449
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

01:51:03.533 --> 01:51:05.576
No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay?

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:07.661
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

01:51:07.746 --> 01:51:10.998
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

01:51:11.082 --> 01:51:12.666
Wait a minute, Doc. What
are you talking about?

01:51:12.751 --> 01:51:14.793
What happens to us in the future?

01:51:14.878 --> 01:51:16.628
Do we become assholes or something?

01:51:16.713 --> 01:51:17.838
No, no, no, no, Marty.

01:51:17.922 --> 01:51:19.673
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

01:51:19.758 --> 01:51:21.216
It's your kids, Marty.

01:51:21.301 --> 01:51:23.552
Something has got to
be done about your kids.

01:51:29.934 --> 01:51:33.020
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

01:51:33.104 --> 01:51:37.274
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
