00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.660
<i>Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed.
I am speed.</i>

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.670
<i>One winner, 42 losers.
I eat losers for breakfast.</i>

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.340
<i>Did I used to say that?</i>

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.420
Yes, sir, you did.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.300
- You used to say that all the time.
- Mater, what are you doing in here?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.470
Well, I didn't want you to be lonely.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.980
Thank you. But I'm kind of preparing
for a race. I need a little quiet.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.020
Right. You got it, buddy.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.480
Hey, everybody, listen up.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.110
My best friend, Lightning McQueen,
needs quiet. Perfect quiet!

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.570
Okay. Where was I?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.080
Racing. Real racing.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.250
That ain't racing. That wasn't even
a Sunday drive. That was one lap.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.590
Racing is 500 of those.
Everybody fighting to move up.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.720
Lap after lap. Inside, outside,
inches apart. Never touching.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.470
- Now that's racing.
- Well, I can't argue with the Doc Hudson.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.980
How true, how true.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.980
Hey, Lightning, you ready?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.480
Yeah. Lightning's ready.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.450
This one's for you, Doc.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.910
Come on, Stickers.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.330
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Best friend coming through. Go, McQueen!

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.880
- Pass him now, 24!
- Lightning McQueen!

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.470
Go, 95!

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.590
Hey, Cal, your blinker's on.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.560
What? No, it's not.
Hey! Your blinker's on.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.850
Good comeback, Cal.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.940
<i>Because I want to run that race.</i>

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.650
<i>I want to run that race</i>

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.320
<i>I do it at my pace</i>

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.370
<i>into the pit goes Lightning McQueen,
Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers.</i>

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.660
These three are fun to watch,
aren't they, Darrell?

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.580
You know, Bob, I can't tell
if they have more fun on or off the track.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.130
<i>Finito! Via, via, via, via.</i>

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.090
You getting a car wash too, Cal?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.880
No, you're getting a car wash, McQueen.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.180
Good comeback, Cal.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.300
<i>We gotta run that race</i>

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.680
<i>we gotta run that race</i>

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.190
<i>we do it at our pace</i>

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.610
<i>long as we get to run that race
hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.270
Lightning, how do you keep your focus
racing against Bobby and Cal?

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.400
I think the key is we respect each other.
These guys are real class acts...

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.480
Congratulations, cupcake.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.190
They are gonna pay.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.910
Go, Dinoco!

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.290
Great win today, Cal.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.500
Thank you, Shannon. It was
a great boost and I was... hey! Guido!

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.880
- Pit stop.
- Ha, ha. Laugh it up. Real funny.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.060
<i>Andiamo! Andiamo!</i>

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.600
Keep it going, buddy!

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.760
We're gonna have to load them
for the next town. Don't you let...

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.680
hey! Are my sponsors happy today?

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.150
Stop winning for crying out loud.
We're running out of bumper cream to sell.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.190
Lightning McQueen!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.820
Hey, big Tex.
How's my favorite competitor?

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.110
Just say the word and...

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.990
I'll boot Cal off the Dinoco team
and replace him with you.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.740
You know I can hear you, right?
I'm right here.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.330
Bye, Cal. See you next week. Or not.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.830
Come on now. I'm joking.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.290
Go, little buddy! And big buddy too!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.130
<i>Another great finish in the making.
McQueen and Swift nose to nose.</i>

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.130
How's the view back there, Bobby?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.670
Well, you better not blink.
I'll blow right past you.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.470
<i>The flag is out. It's the final stretch.
McQueen in the lead.</i>

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.770
Okay, let's see what you got.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.280
<i>Holy cow!</i>

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.990
<i>It's Jackson Storm for the win.
A huge upset!</i>

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.070
<i>Neither Lightning nor Bobby
ever saw him coming.</i>

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.290
<i>It's one thing to start fast, but we
haven't seen anyone cross the line...</i>

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.410
<i>With that kind of speed and power
since a young...</i>

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.670
<i>Lightning McQueen first arrived
on the scene.</i>

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.340
- Hey, Bobby? Who is that?
- That's Jackson Storm.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.010
Yeah. He's one of the rookies.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.720
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
No, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.680
Hey. Jackson Storm, right?
Great race today.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.480
Thank you, Mr. McQueen.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.060
You have no idea what a pleasure it is
for me to finally beat you.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.030
Thanks. Wait. Hang on.
Did you say "meet" or "beat"?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.820
- I think you heard me.
- What?

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.280
Storm, can we get some pictures?

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.030
Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let's get a picture.
You know what?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.790
Get a ton of pictures because champ here
has been a role model of mine...

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.130
For years now. And I mean a lot of years.
Right? I love this guy.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.460
Storm, give us a quote.
What's your top speed?

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.340
I think I touched a nerve.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.640
Welcome back to Chick's Picks
with Chick Hicks.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.060
I'm your host, former and forever,
Piston Cup champion, Chick Hicks.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.020
This just in:

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.150
rookie Jackson Storm slams
the proverbial door on Lightning McQueen.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.660
I couldn't have enjoyed it more
if I'd beaten McQueen myself.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.660
Wait, I have. But enough about me.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.330
Here to tell you how it happened
is professional number...

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.370
cruncher Miss Natalie Certain.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.960
It's a pleasure to be here, Chick.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.210
And actually,
i prefer the term "statistical analyst".

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.510
Right. So, who is this mysterious
newcomer, Jackson Storm?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.260
And why is he so darn fast?

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.930
It's no mystery
if you study the data, Mr. Hicks.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.060
Jackson Storm is part of
the next generation of high-tech racers.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.100
Unlike the veterans of yesterday...

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.150
What? Old-timers like this guy?

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.490
Right. Storm achieves his top speeds
by exploiting the numbers.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.740
I refer, of course, to racing data.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.320
Tire pressure, downforce, weight
distribution, aerodynamics, and...

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.200
Next-gens like Storm
are taking advantage.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.580
The racing world is changing.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.080
And for the better if it means my old pal,
Lightning, is down for the count.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.170
Am I right, Certain?

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.630
Well, if I'm certain of anything, Chick...

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.250
It's that this season
is about to get even more interesting.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.090
<i>I'll tell you what, Darrell, Jackson
Storm has certainly made an impact.</i>

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.550
<i>We've got six more next-generation
rookies in the field.</i>

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.810
<i>With six veterans fired to clear the way.</i>

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.430
Morning, champ.
How's our living legend today?

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.440
Still very much alive, thank you.
And I would appreciate...

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.360
you know, I can't believe I get to race
the Lightning McQueen.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.740
- In his farewell season.
- What are you talking about?

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.240
Green flag. Good luck out there, champ.
You're gonna need it.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.330
<i>One reason Storm and the next-gens
are more efficient:</i>

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.080
Their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.500
<i>Win number three
for the rookie sensation.</i>

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.710
<i>Storm's in a class of his own.
And a big reason for that:</i>

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.670
<i>Training on the newest cutting-edge
simulators. These machines create a...</i>

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.630
<i>Virtual racing experience so real
racers never even have to go outside.</i>

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.550
<i>Storm's ability to hold that line
is like nothing we've ever seen.</i>

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.930
<i>Four in a row? Are you kidding me?</i>

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.100
<i>2% lower drag coefficient.</i>

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.140
<i>- What a finish!
- 5% increase downforce.</i>

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.850
<i>- Lucky number seven.
- 1.2% higher top speed.</i>

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.730
<i>Amazing! Nine!</i>

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.020
<i>Piston Cup winner, Chick Hicks here
with the racer taking the circuit...</i>

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.030
<i>By Storm. Jackson Storm.</i>

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.070
<i>Another easy win over old "ka-chow".
Or should I say, "caboose"?</i>

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.320
<i>Because he's always in the back.
Am I right?</i>

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.370
<i>No, no, no, Chick.
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ.</i>

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.710
<i>He's the elder statesman of the sport.
You know?</i>

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.290
<i>Takes everything I got to beat him.</i>

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.170
You got to be kidding me.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.460
What changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top?

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.050
- Will McQueen try new training methods?
- Ls he prepared to retire?

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.430
Come on, guys. Let's not overreact.
It's just a slump.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.140
We'll get 'em next week.
Okay, that's enough. No comment.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.810
- Not even about Weathers retiring?
- Wait. What?

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.020
Cal Weathers.
He's hanging up his lightyears.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.570
No. No comment on that either.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.530
Wait a minute. Please, come on.
You got to give us something.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:12.200
Hey, Cal! Hey.
Retirement? What's going on?

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.790
You know, I asked my uncle once
how I'd know when it was time to stop.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.500
You know what he said?
The youngsters will tell you.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.720
We had some good times together.
I'm gonna miss that the most I think.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.600
Yeah.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.030
<i>More changes ahead, Chick.</i>

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.240
Every week we've seen
veteran racers either retire...

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.200
Like Cal Weathers tonight,
or fired to make room for these younger...

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.540
Faster racers. And, it's not over yet.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.330
<i>Hello racing fans.
Welcome to the Los Angeles 500.</i>

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.960
<i>The final race of the piston cup season.
It's been a year of surprises...</i>

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.880
they can't do this.
I've raced for you guys almost 10 years.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.180
Sorry, brick. My mind's made up.
I'm giving your number to someone new.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.890
Hey, I had two wins last year!

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.470
The whole sport's changing.
I'm just doing what I got to do.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:22.400
Do you know what's happening with brick...
wait, you're not Bobby.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.230
The name's Danny, bro.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.000
Hey, champ, where'd all your friends go?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.880
<i>A final check of his tires
as Storm settles into the pole position.</i>

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.840
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity.
Let's end this season with a great race.</i>

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.900
That's it, buddy!

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.080
<i>Forty laps to go
and race leader, Jackson Storm...</i>

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.370
<i>Is making his way onto pit road
with McQueen on his tail.</i>

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.250
<i>A good stop here could mean
the difference between victory and defeat.</i>

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.130
Come on, come on. Come on!
Faster, guido, come on.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.300
I got to get back out there before
he does. Guido, hurry up!

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.760
<i>Fatto, fatto.</i>

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.270
<i>What a pit stop by McQueen!
Man, he just got the lead!</i>

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.060
<i>But can he hold on to it?</i>

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.400
Hey, McQueen, are you all right?
Listen, don't you worry, pal.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.450
You had a good run. Enjoy your retirement!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160
<i>Storm takes back the lead!</i>

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.580
<i>Unbelievable! McQueen is fading!
McQueen is fading! Fading fast!</i>

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.920
No.No! No! No!

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.420
No!

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.470
<i>W-h-l-z</i>

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.090
<i>welcome back to piston cup talk.</i>

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.100
<i>Around the clock where we do nothing
but talk racing. Let's get to it.</i>

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.350
<i>Starting of course with Lighting McQueen.</i>

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.650
<i>With the season just two weeks away,
there's still no official announcement.</i>

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.980
<i>But with number 95 coming off
his worst year on record...</i>

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.610
<i>don't shoot the messenger here, folks.
I think it's safe to assume...</i>

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.110
<i>That Lighting McQueen's
racing days are over.</i>

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.400
<i>Meanwhile, Jackson Storm
is looking even faster...</i>

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.160
<i>for the checkered flag.</i>

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.660
<i>As they enter the final lap,
the number 6 and number 12 cars...</i>

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.790
<i>Are still fighting it out for the lead.
But wait! Here he comes!</i>

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.960
<i>It's the fabulous Hudson Hornet
knocking at their door.</i>

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.340
<i>What's he got up his sleeve today?
And there it is!</i>

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.180
<i>With one move, he's past them.
The Hornet takes a decisive lead.</i>

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.310
<i>He's left the pack behind.
His crew chief, Smokey, is loving it!</i>

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.850
<i>It's unbelievable! No! He's in trouble!</i>

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:11.150
<i>The Hudson Hornet has lost control!</i>

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.030
<i>What should have been a scene
of jubilation has turned tragic, folks.</i>

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.700
<i>As we await news
on the Hudson Hornet's condition.</i>

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.960
<i>After such a devastating crash...</i>

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.540
<i>We can only hope that
this race today wasn't his last.</i>

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.880
<i>When I finally got put together,
i went back expecting a big welcome.</i>

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.510
You know what they said? You're history.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.550
Moved right on to the next rookie
standing in line.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.850
There was a lot left in me
i never got a chance to show.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.160
Hey, Stickers.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.040
Hey, Sal.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.080
How you feeling?

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.300
Yeah, great. Really, really great.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.880
Been thinking about Doc again?

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.050
Yeah. You know they told him
when he was done.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.430
He didn't decide.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.190
I don't want what happened to Doc
to happen to me.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:34.850
But that hasn't happened.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.490
No, but I can't go out on the track
and do the same old thing. It won't work.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.780
Then change it up! Try something new.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.530
- I don't know, Sally. I...
- don't fear failure.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.120
Be afraid of not having the chance.
You have the chance. Doc didn't.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.630
And you can either take it or you can
do what you been doing. Sitting.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.710
In here. For months. And by the way,
i love what you've done with the place.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.550
I mean the monster movie lighting
and the musky air freshener.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.560
Don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer because...

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.600
I have never found you more attractive.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.810
And now that I've been in here
for a couple minutes, the stench...

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.480
- I'm getting kind of used to it.
- Okay, sal. I get it. I get it.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.570
I miss you, Lighting. We all do.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.660
Try something new, huh?

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.040
Hey, did it work, miss Sally?

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.500
Did you set him straight
with your lawyerly powers of persuasion?

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.380
Is he ready to start training?

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.540
Well, stinky...
stickers?

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.670
Yes, mater, I am.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.590
I decide when I'm done.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.220
- I was hoping you'd say that.
- Okay, but I got an idea.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.350
And I'm gonna need to talk to rusty
and dusty, all right?

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.020
I'll get them on the horn.
Get it? On the horn?

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.400
Oops. Hold on. Got to sneeze.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.200
Dadgum, I lost it.
Hey, I'll see you at flo's.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.540
I found it.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.160
Hey, watch your step.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.870
<i>What about the car from Everett?
Remember him?</i>

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.040
<i>He was stuck in reverse! I said, you
need a house with a circular driveway!</i>

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.370
You need to get your rusty tails down
here. I created a drink in your honor.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.380
Yeah! The rust-eze medicated
bumper bomb.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.380
It goes down faster than an elevator
full of winnebagos.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.380
- Rusty and dusty!
- Well, look who's here.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.010
<i>There he is! Good to see you, Lighting!</i>

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.010
Thanks, guys. You're all here.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.680
Sorry, buddy,
did you want this call to be private?

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.730
No, mater. This is perfect. Listen,
thanks, everyone, for sticking by me.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.110
It took me a while to figure it out,
but I know now that it's time...

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.150
For me to make some changes.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.910
- Changes? What kind of changes?
- Lt's futile to resist change, man.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.080
- You're right, Fillmore.
- Really?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.700
Which is why
i have an announcement to make.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.710
I've thought long and hard about it.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.540
Done a lot of soul-searching
and considered all of the options.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.760
And I've finally decided...

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.800
You do want to keep racing?

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.220
Are you kidding?
Of course I want to keep racing!

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.600
- Thank goodness!
- Glad to hear it. All right.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.520
Man, for a second i...
wait a minute. I knew that the whole time.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.140
Guys! I'm talking about
making this my best season yet!

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.940
<i>We were hoping you'd say that.</i>

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.730
The thing is, if I'm gonna be faster than
Storm, I need to train like him.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.110
<i>We're way ahead of you, buddy!</i>

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.950
<i>Lighting, we want you on the road
first thing in the morning...</i>

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.740
<i>So you can come out
and see the brand-new...</i>

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.410
<i>Rust-eze racing center!</i>

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.960
<i>- It's wicked awesome.
- What? Rust-eze racing center?</i>

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.290
<i>It's got all the fancy bells and whistles
that kids are training on these days.</i>

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.960
<i>We'll send macky boy all the directions.
Now get moving, all right?</i>

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.510
Qkay! Yes!

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.300
- Fancy new training center?
- That sounds nice!

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.640
Guido, come! We have to pack the tires!

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.810
Hey, McQueen! You can't race
in primer, man. Come on! Let's go.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.110
Ramone, you have done it again.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.860
It's like the sistine chapel on wheels.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.490
I'm coming for you, Storm.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.160
Morning, McQueen! Hey, look at you.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.790
He looks so good!

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.370
Welcome back. You look different.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.210
- Obviously.
- You look ready.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.840
<i>Guido, come! Scusi, scusi.
Tires coming through.</i>

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.670
Go kick those rookies in the trunk.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.300
All right, bye.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.970
- Catch you on the flipside.
- I'll see you guys in Florida.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.390
- See you, McQueen.
- Don't forget to call me.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.890
Good luck in college.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.480
- Hey, sal. Thanks.
- Anytime.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.640
- Love you!
- Love you more.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:02.350
Rust-eze racing center, here we come!
Good times ahead.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.200
<i>When the time gets right.</i>

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.660
<i>I'm gonna pick you up</i>

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.290
<i>and take you far away from</i>

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.580
<i>from trouble, my love</i>

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.040
<i>under a big old sky</i>

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.840
<i>out in a field of green</i>

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.180
<i>there's got to be something</i>

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.350
<i>left for us to believe</i>

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.680
<i>oh, I await the day</i>

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.400
<i>good fortune comes our way</i>

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.860
<i>and we'll ride down the king's highway</i>

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.400
<i>yeah, yeah
yeah.</i>

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.880
- McQueen, over here!
- McQueen, how you feeling?

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.590
Have you seen the latest records
Storm's been setting?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.260
Have you given any thought to retirement?

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.100
Okay, that's enough. No questions!
Scusi. Out of the way!

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.770
Coming through! Okay, back up. Back up!
No pictures. No, no, no.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.930
Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.100
- Guido, can you believe them?
- Paparazzi.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.330
Looks good, doesn't it?

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.330
- Hey, guys.
- What do you think?

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.790
What do I think? It's unbelievable.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.790
Yeah, you know, it's kind of a cozy,
humble, little place.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960
Guys, how did you ever do this?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.590
- You want to tell him or should I?
- No, you start. Go ahead.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.340
We sold rust-eze.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.600
What?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.850
What? You think a couple ofjabronis
like us could do this on our own?

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.270
- Wait. You sold rust-eze?
- Lt's all good news.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.150
We just realized that you needed
something that we couldn't give you.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.650
It felt like
the time was right for us too.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.480
I mean, we're not as young and handsome
as we look.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.150
That's true.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.410
Besides, this Sterling fellow? He's got
every high-tech thing you'll ever need.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.990
Everything we wanted to give you,
but couldn't.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.660
Sterling? Who's Sterling?

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.330
Lighting McQueen!
You made some serious time, partner.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:37.250
Your new sponsor. He's the
mudflap king of the eastern seaboard.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.010
Welcome to
the rust-eze racing center!

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.010
You have no idea how much
I've been looking forward to this.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.810
- Thanks, Mr....
- please. No "mister". Just Sterling.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.850
I have been a fan of yours forever.
And to be your sponsor?

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.020
How great is that?
I can't thank rusty and dusty here enough.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.690
Tough negotiators by the way.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.860
You flatter us, but don't stop!

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.860
Anyway, just wanted to say a quick hello.
Take as much time as you need.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.280
Door's always open, guys.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.200
See?

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.130
I sure am gonna miss racing for you guys.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.550
You know, you gave us
a lot of great memories, Lighting.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.050
Memories we'll remember.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.350
That's good.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.310
- Hey, Lighting, whatever you do...
- don't drive like my brother!

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.520
- Don't drive like my brother.
- Please no pictures.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.820
Okay, maybe one.
Get my good side though, will you?

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.930
So? You like it?

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:13.770
Hey, Mr. Sterling.
My career on a wall.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.770
Nice that you included Doc.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.350
Of course. He was your mentor.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.730
Losing him left a giant hole in the sport.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.950
Yeah. Jars of dirt?

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.570
Sacred dirt.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.280
Each of those jars contains dirt
from all the old tracks that Doc raced on.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.080
Florida international, thunder hollow,
just down the road and...

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.040
Our very own fireball beach,
right outside.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.210
Hey, is that...

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.960
a bit of asphalt from Glen Ellen.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.380
My first win! You really are a fan.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.600
I am. And a fan of your future.
You ready for it?

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.600
Definitely.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.310
First, let's get you into a more...
Contemporary look.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.490
<i>It's an electronic suit.</i>

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.620
<i>With it we'll be able to track your speed
and your vital signs.</i>

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.740
Does it have a phone?

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.790
<i>Don't be crazy.
Racecars don't have phones.</i>

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.090
- Not bad, huh?
- This is really impressive.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.300
This center has quickly become
the most coveted destination...

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.420
For young racers training
to make our team someday.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.430
And it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.180
Treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.140
Still working on that.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.690
And the best fitness regimen
anyone could possibly imagine.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.900
Wait. Wait.
Ls that the simulator?

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.190
Yes.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.530
Lighting, I'd like to introduce you
to the multi-million dollar...

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.200
Flagship of interactive race simulation.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.040
The xdl 24-gts mark z.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:06.040
The xdl... etcetera.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.840
Jackson Storm wishes he had this model.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.100
- That was amazing.
- Awesome. Yeah!

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.890
It's just like being on a real track,
so put your hours in.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.390
Okay, let's hit the treadmills.
Come on. Show me what you got!

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.570
- Pretty fast. Who's the racer?
- No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.990
Cruz Ramirez.
The best trainer in the business.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.160
Ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it?

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.200
All right. Now bring up those rpms!

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.080
Like the attitude.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.580
Yeah, we call her
our maestro of motivation.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.580
You're driving
a little tense again, Ronald.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.290
- No, no. I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Do your exercise.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:54.380
I am a fluffy cloud! I am a fluffy cloud!
I am a fluffy cloud.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.590
There you go!

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.510
- You're a cloud.
- Shut up, Kurt!

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.140
Here come the bugs, Kurt. You ready?

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.930
Hey, I kept my eyes open this time!

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.020
Got to see that track.
No. Homesick again, Gabriel?

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.190
<i>Si.</i>

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.780
<i>Santa Cecilia! Mi pueblo!</i>

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.070
Win for them!

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.370
She trains young racers
to push through their own obstacles.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.370
Tailor-made for each one.
Now, she's gonna work with you.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.620
Let's go! Let's go!
You guys got to work through this stuff...

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.790
So when your big chance comes along
you can take it.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.630
- Hey, Cruz.
- Hey, Mr. Sterling!

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.470
I'd like to introduce you
to Lighting McQueen.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.970
I hear you're the maestro.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.220
Mr. Sterling, did you say Lighting
McQueen was here because...

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.140
I don't see him anywhere.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.640
But he's right here.
Do you not see him?

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.100
Nope, still don't see him.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.610
He's right in front of you!
It's Lighting McQueen!

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.780
He's obviously an imposter. He looks
old and broken down with flabby tires.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.490
- Hey! I do not!
- Use that!

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.570
Yeah, I see.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.530
I can use that energy
for motivation, right?

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.450
It's all about motivation, Mr. McQueen.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.330
You can use anything negative as fuel
to push through to the positive.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.670
I've been pretty positive
ever since I was a rookie.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.010
I am so excited that I get to train you.
I grew up watching you on TV.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.130
Is that right?

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.050
These young guys are great and all,
but I like a challenge.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.520
- L'm not that much older, but...
- in fact, I call you my senior project.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.530
We need to loosen those ancient joints.
First the wheels.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.320
And forward, and rest,
and forward, and rest.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.740
Join me! Rest. And rest.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.410
Is all this resting necessary?

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.370
We're working you in slowly.
And reach for your lunch.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.460
Reach for your lunch.
Now reach, to the front.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.040
What is there? It's your lunch.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.880
Now backwards. Is lunch there?

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.170
When do we go on the simulator?

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.590
Good morning, Mr. McQueen. Looking good.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.390
Why?

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.390
This'll get oil to places it hasn't been
in a long time.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.020
- Is that a drip pan?
- Just in case.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.610
How old do you think I am?

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:20.030
Visualize yourself driving fast down
a steep hill. I'll be back in a few.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:26.030
Visualize... wait. Cruz! A few what?
I just want to go on the simulator.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.450
How's it hanging, drip pan?

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.210
- 'Sup.
- Okay, day three:

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.130
Treadmill. I've set a maximum speed
to conserve your energy.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.890
What I want you to do is
visualize beating this guy.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.770
- Storm!
- That's right.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.180
Get him! Get him, Mr. McQueen!

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.310
Get him? This thing's only going
like 5 miles an hour!

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.230
We'll work up to the higher speeds
right after you take your nap.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.360
Nap? I don't need a nap!

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.610
- Hit him with the bugs!
- I am not taking a nap!

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.450
<i>All cars in the test bay simulator...</i>

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.120
how was your nap, Mr. McQueen?

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.960
It was kind of refreshing actually.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.120
Okay, what are you... hey!

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.420
You've been driving on tires a long time.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.500
Have you ever stopped to get to know them?

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.710
I'm sorry, what?

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.800
Tires are individuals.
You should give each a name.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.890
Name them? I won't be doing that.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.850
Mine are named Maria, Juanita, Ronaldo,
and Debbie Richardson.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.470
- What?
- Long story.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.060
May I have my tires back
so I can go on the simulator please?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.940
Name them!

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.940
Lefty, Righty, Backy, Backy Junior. Okay?

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.770
- Does this make you mad?
- Yes, it does!

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.320
Use that! And merge, and yield,
and merge, and yield.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.410
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Now you got some tire damage.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.040
Speed bump, speed bump.
Now clean up your messy garage.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.130
- Bug in your windshield.
- Thank you, Cruz, I'm done.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.040
Mr. McQueen, where are you going?

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.380
To the future.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.510
Okay. Here we go.
How do I do this? Come on, baby.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.350
Mr. McQueen...

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.890
Cruz, thank you for the old-man training,
as crazy as it was, but I'm...

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.480
Warmed up enough
and now I need you to launch this thing.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.020
Wait until you can handle it. Please?
There are no shortcuts.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.860
Okay. We'll just see about that.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.940
All right.
My star racer is on the simulator!

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.490
Why, yes, I am!

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.820
Well, let's see you take it out
for a spin.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.660
Right away, Mr. Sterling,
owner of the company.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.000
Okay. Have fun.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.670
This is what I'm talking about.
Didn't know about those.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.670
<i>Prepare to race. The green flag is out.</i>

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.470
I don't see the flag. What do I do?

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.630
- Go.
- Go?

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.100
That's sensitive.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.520
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.020
It shouldn't be this hard, should it?

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.100
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.150
You're fighting the simulator.
Just race like you always do.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.320
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.820
There can't be this many walls
on a regular track!

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.690
<i>You have been passed by Jackson Storm.</i>

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.280
- Wait, Storm's in here?
- For motivation.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.660
Storm races at 207.
Pick it up, Mr. McQueen!

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.990
L'm trying!

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.700
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.620
Mr. McQueen, come down from there
and we'll work you up to this.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.330
I am fine, Cruz. I can do it, okay?

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.710
<i>You have jumped a barrier.</i>

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.550
Sorry!

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.050
<i>You have maimed two vehicles.
You have destroyed a drinking fountain.</i>

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.060
<i>You have disabled an ambulance.</i>

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.730
<i>You are on fire. Danger. Danger.</i>

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.060
<i>You are going the wrong way.</i>

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.940
Look out! Turn it off!

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.070
Get these things off of me!

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.200
<i>You have crashed. You have crashed.</i>

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.730
<i>- Are you all right?
- You have crashed.</i>

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.690
I have crashed.

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.580
- It's not easy for him.
- Cruz, just relax.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.200
- Give him another chance.
- I will talk to him.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.410
- I can still work with him.
- I know he's your project.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.870
- Are you sure?
- Cruz.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.290
- Well, can't you just...
- Cruz.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.000
- It's not easy for him.
- Look, I'm trying to help you.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.130
You're all washed up, McQueen.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.930
I'm sorry. What?

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.680
I said,
the floor's all washed up and clean.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.390
Right.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.220
Thank you very much.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.020
Good luck.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.320
Hey, Lighting. Come on in.
Got something to show you. You ready?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.030
For what?

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:51.730
You are about to become
the biggest brand in racing.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.030
We are talking saturation on all
continents for every demographic.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.320
Movie deals, infomercials,
product endorsements.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.870
- Mudflaps?
- Of course.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.080
We'll be rich beyond belief.
You think you're famous now?

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.000
I thought you'd be mad
about the simulator.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.380
I mean, this is all great, Mr. Sterling,
i guess, but I don't know.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.670
I've never really thought of myself
as a brand.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:20.850
Nor do I. I'm a fan. Maybe your most avid.
I think of this as your legacy!

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.690
It sounds like something that happens
after you're done racing.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.570
Mr. Sterling, what is this about?

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.190
Look, Lighting. I'm not gonna race you.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.610
What? What do you mean not race me?

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.030
- Hold on. Hold on.
- L'm not going to Florida?

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.410
You have no idea how excited I was
to get you here because...

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:50.880
I knew you'd be back. It was gonna be
the comeback story of the year!

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.460
But your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.090
I'm sorry.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.930
We're talking about speed on a simulator.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.430
- Listen to how crazy that sounds.
- Look, I'm trying to help you.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.810
As your sponsor, yes,
but also as your friend.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.060
Your racing days are coming to an end.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.980
Every time you lose, you damage yourself.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:15.360
Damage the brand, you mean?

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.820
Lighting, come on. You've done the work.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.070
Now move on to the next phase
and reap the reward.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.660
The racing is the reward. Not the stuff.
I don't want to cash in.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.080
I want to feel the rush
of moving 200 miles an hour...

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.420
Inches from the other guys, pushing myself
faster than I thought I could go!

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.000
That's the reward, Mr. Sterling!

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.050
Lighting, come on.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.760
Look, loan do this. Loan, I promise!
I'll train like I did with Doc.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.140
I'll get my tires dirty
on every dirt track from here to Florida.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.260
I can start on fireball beach
where all the old greats used to race.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:56.600
Get your tires dirty. That's how
you're gonna get faster than Storm?

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.440
Yes! Exactly! I mean, sacred dirt, right?

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.440
Mr. Sterling, if you care about
my legacy, the one that Doc started,

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.990
you'll let me do this.
I promise you, I will win.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.490
I don't know.
What you're asking, it's too risky.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.660
Come on. You like it, I can tell.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.870
It's got that little "comeback story
of the year" feel to it, doesn't it?

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.210
One race?

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.090
If you don't win at Florida,
you'll retire?

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.390
Look, if I don't win
I'll sell all the mudflaps you got.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:38.310
But if I do win,
i decide when I'm done. Deal?

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.190
Deal.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.560
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
You won't be sorry.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.860
Just one thing and this is only because
i don't like taking chances.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:49.860
You're taking someone with you.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.500
You talked him into it!
Way to go, Mr. McQueen!

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.170
Cruz.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.170
You could talk a snowmobile
into an air conditioner.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.670
You're going with me? With that thing?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.340
Yeah. You still need my help.
You're brittle like a fossil.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.730
- We got the cable.
- I don't need a trainer out here, Cruz.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.350
You're old! What if you fall on this beach
and can't get up?

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.860
Well, life's a beach and then you drive.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.900
- McQueen.
- Thank you.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.870
This is beautiful. I can see why Mr.
Sterling said you wanted to train here.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.910
As soon as this thing's booted up,
we'll get you on the treadmill...

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.370
- And I'll track your speed.
- What? No!

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.380
The whole idea is getting my tires dirty.
Real racing.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.050
I'm not driving on that thing when
I've got the sand and the whole earth.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.880
- Okay.
- Luigi, let's do this.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.890
Welcome, racers, to fireball beach!

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.770
Historic home
for today's great test of speed.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.900
Our finish line will be
the abandoned pier in the distance.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.280
All right. Quicker than quick,
faster than fast, I am speed...

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.900
that is great self-motivation.
Did you come up with that?

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:19.410
- Yeah, I did.
- On your mark. Get set. Go!

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:37.430
There you go! Felt good!
Hey, what was my speed?

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.930
I don't know.
I can only track you on the treadmill.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.390
No treadmills!

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.430
- What about Hamilton?
- Hamilton here.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.440
- Who's Hamilton?
- My electronic personal assistant.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.110
You know, like on your phone.
You do have a phone, don't you?

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.780
Racecars don't have phones, Cruz.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.450
Hamilton, track Mr. McQueen's speed
and report it.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.990
- Tracking.
- I'll stay as close as I can.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.120
Your suit will transmit your speeds
to Hamilton.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.580
Fine. Whatever. Let's do this.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.170
Quicker than quick, faster than fast,
i am speed. Come on, Luigi.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.840
On your mark, get set, and go!

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:17.010
<i>46 miles per hour. 63 miles. Out of range.</i>

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.640
That's odd. I didn't go!

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.310
On sand you got to ease into your start
so your tires can grab, okay?

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.360
- Okay.
- You do work with racecars, don't you?

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.480
- Yeah, but never outside.
- All right. Let's go again.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.530
Go!

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:41.780
<i>54 miles per hour. 75 miles per hour.
Out of range.</i>

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.790
Sorry! Got stuck!

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.330
- G<> again!
- Al'1d go!

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.790
- Sorryq.
- 60!

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.840
Go!

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.630
The beach ate me.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.800
All right, Cruz,
pick a line on the compacted sand.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.350
You got to have traction or you're
gonna spin out. Let's do this thing!

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.180
On your mark, get set, go!

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:13.940
<i>122 miles per hour. 134 miles...
out of range.</i>

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.150
- Now what?
- I didn't want to hit a crab!

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.200
- You got to be kidding me.
- What? It was cute!

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.490
All right, one last chance to try this
before it gets dark.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.710
Now, you're going to take off slow
to let your tires grab.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:33.210
And pick a straight line on hard sand
so you don't spin out.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.880
And all of the crabbies
have gone night-night.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.720
- Mr. McQueen.
- All right. Let's go again.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.220
And go!

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.680
<i>150 miles per hour. 175 miles per hour.</i>

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.390
<i>196 miles per hour.</i>

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.690
All right! Finally! You made it!
Congratulations! How'd I do?

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.240
You topped out at 198.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.070
198? That's it?

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.660
Still slower than Storm.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.160
Wasted my whole day.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.410
I wouldn't say that.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.830
It did feel great to be out here
doing real racing.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.580
This isn't real racing. We're on a beach!

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.340
All you do is go straight.
How am I gonna get faster if I don't...

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:26.010
thunder hollow. Thunder hollow!
There's a dirt track there!

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.600
That's what I need!
To race against actual racers.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.730
No! Too public! If the press find you,
they will be like many bugs on you.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.440
- Paparazzi!
- Guys, I really need this!

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:43.240
Just leave it to me, boss.
I am a master of disguise.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.080
All right! Next!

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.260
You, sir, are officially incognito.
Nobody's bothering you.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.720
The great Lighting McQueen.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.890
I can feel it, guys.
Tonight is the night I find my speed!

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.850
<i>Racers, get on over
to the startin' line. Pronto!</i>

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.610
All right! No more straight lines.
Just a good old-fashioned oval.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.650
Hey, now! You that out-of-towner?

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.940
Yes. That's me! Chester whipplefilter.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.910
And I'm Frances beltline.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.990
- Cruz, what are you doing?
- L'm your trainer.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.990
I'm gonna track your speed
from the infield, whipplefilter.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.200
Fine. Just stay out of the way.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.080
Excuse me, sir?
Where are the other racers?

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:50.090
They'll be along. We always
let our guests start right up front.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.140
<i>Welcome, y'all,
to thunder hollow speedway...</i>

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:02.180
<i>For tonight's edition of crazy eight!</i>

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:13.530
Did he say crazy eight?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:15.990
<i>Race fans!</i>

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.910
<i>It's time to meet tonight's challengers!</i>

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.040
Have a nice trip!

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.750
Protect and swerve!

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.220
Cruz! This isn't what I thought it was.
Come on, follow me and we'll slip out.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.380
Rule number one:
The gate closes, you race.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.050
Wait! No, no, no. I'm not a racer.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.010
Rule number two:
Last car standing wins.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:52.890
And rule number three:
No cursing! It's family night.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.270
- Excuse me, sir?
- Wait. No, I'm just a trainer!

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.270
<i>And make way for the undefeated
crazy eight champion...</i>

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:07.650
<i>The diva of demolition, miss fritter!</i>

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.950
Boo!

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:16.450
Lookie here, boys.
We got us a couple of rookies.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.460
I'm gonna call you muddy britches
and you lemonade.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.170
Hey, neither one of them
has a single dent.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.210
I'm gonna fix that!

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.890
<i>All right, everybody! Let's go racing!</i>

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.150
I'm about to commit a moving violation.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.110
<i>Boo!</i>

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.580
Cruz!

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:55.950
Watch out.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.830
What are you doing? Got to keep moving!

00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.960
I shouldn't be out here!

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.460
Move, Cruz! Move!

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.420
What do I do? I can't steer!

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:05.710
Turn right to go left!
Turn right to go left!

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.630
- That doesn't make any sense!
- Turn right to go left!

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.430
- Hey, Patty.
- Hey, bill!

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:30.820
Look, ma, I can drive...
oh, man!

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:34.530
Nice day for a drive, huh?

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.660
Hey, buddy! Get the... Out of my way!

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.580
Hey! I'm driving...

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.510
look at my new hat!

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.010
I'm flying! No! I'm not flying!

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.390
Get it. Get it.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.180
' Qot it!

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.100
Cruz!

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.570
Hey, buddy! Move it!

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.490
Turn right to go left.
Turn right to go left.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.080
- Here I come, boy!
- No, no, no!

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.880
No.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.130
<i>Buckle up, everybody!</i>

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.170
<i>It's fritter time!</i>

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.420
Fritter! Fritter!

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.470
Fritter! Fritter! Fritter!

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.850
We love you, miss fritter.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:52.230
Yeah! Your license plate's gonna look
real nice in my collection.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.270
- Oh, boy.
- Run!

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.730
No.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.860
Remember,
obey all appropriate street signs.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.860
Cruz!

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.410
H ey__

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.040
<i>oh, my gracious! Miss fritter's down!</i>

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.840
Nobody touches him. He is mine!

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.760
You gonna get it now, whipplefilter!

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.890
Come on, McQueen. You can do it.
Come on, Lighting, keep going.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.570
<i>Miss fritter is looking to get upright,
folks. And she is not pleased.</i>

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.440
- Get up. Get up!
- Fritter! Fritter!

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.110
You about to feel the wrath of the...

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.910
Lower belleville county
unified school district!

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.790
What the... wait...

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.340
no, no, no! No! No!

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:06.300
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!
Frances beltline!</i>

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.800
Ls that me? That's me! I won! I won!

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:11.850
- Cruz! Cruz! No!
- Watch out!

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.790
Whipplefilter?

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.580
It's Lighting McQueen!

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:43.840
McQueen!

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.340
<i>Fans here at thunder hollow
still buzzing over tonight's...</i>

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.680
<i>Unexpected appearance
of Lighting McQueen.</i>

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:53.430
<i>He has always been my favorite!</i>

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.730
<i>My garage is covered from head to toe
with 95 posters.</i>

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.560
<i>Tell our listeners at home you weren't
really trying to wreck him, were you?</i>

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.980
So trophy's kind of nice.
Don't you think?

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.860
I mean, I know you got like a billion
of them, so you would know.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.530
I still can't believe I won. It's pretty
shiny. I have never seen one up close.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.250
Looks like they spent a lot of money
on it. I mean, I think it's real metal.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.040
Stop. Just stop, okay, Cruz?
You don't even know.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:23.290
- You don't even have one clue...
- hey! I was just trying...

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.840
do you know what happens
if I lose this race?

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:31.220
Every mile of this trip was to get me
faster than Jackson Storm. Faster!

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.510
I started off getting nowhere for a week
on a simulator!

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.890
I lose a whole day with you
on fireball beach.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.390
And then I waste tonight
in the crosshairs of miss fritter!

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.140
I'm stuck in the same speed I was
a month ago!

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:47.520
I can't get any faster because I'm
too busy taking care of my trainer!

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:53.240
<i>This is my last chance, Cruz.
Last! Final! Finito!</i>

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.740
If I lose, I never get to do this again.
If you were a racer...

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:02.080
You'd know what I'm talking about
but you're not! So you don't.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.130
- Mack! Pull over!
- What? Now?

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.050
- Now!
- Okay! Pulling over!

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.930
Ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer,
Mr. McQueen. Go ahead.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:30.310
Ask me if I got up in the dark
to run laps before school every day.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.650
Ask me if I saved every penny
to buy a ticket to the races

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.530
when they came to town.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:39.780
Ask me if I did that so I could
be a trainer someday. Ask me.

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:42.450
- No!

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.040
I've wanted to become a racer forever!
Because of you!

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:57.050
I used to watch you on TV,
flying through the air.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.850
You seemed so... fearless.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:08.810
"Dream small, Cruz,"
that's what my family used to say.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.560
"Dream small or not at all."

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.990
They were just trying to protect me.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:22.280
But I was the fastest kid in town
and I was gonna prove them wrong.

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:25.660
What happened?

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.630
When I got to my first race,
i figured it out.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.090
What?

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.250
That I didn't belong.
The other racers looked nothing like me.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:47.220
They were bigger and stronger
and so... confident.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.810
And when they started their engines,
that was it...

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.310
I knew I'd never be a racer.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:05.860
L just left. It was my one shot
and I didn't take it.

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:16.040
Yeah, so, I'm gonna head back
to the training center.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.870
I think we both know it's for the best.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.170
But can I ask you something?

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.840
What was it like for you?
When you showed up to your first race?

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.810
How did you know you could do it?

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:39.100
I don't know.
I just never thought I couldn't.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.110
I wish I knew what that felt like.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.450
Good luck, Mr. McQueen.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.830
Cruz. Cruz, wait.

00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:00.830
<i>And earn your physics degree
from the comfort of your own home...</i>

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.250
<i>you'll get that and a $200 gift,
for $29.95.</i>

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.750
<i>- Now look here, warden...
- No! He's got a Jack!</i>

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.050
<i>Autos over 100,000 miles
also reported trouble sleeping.</i>

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.680
<i>You could have 12 worn-out wrenches
or you could have one atomic wrench.</i>

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.430
<i>Throw the old ones out.
This covers...</i>

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:18.760
<i>"champion for the ages" Chick Hicks here.
Coming to you live from...</i>

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.140
<i>Chick Hicks studios,
where I'm joined once again by...</i>

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:23.270
<i>Next-gen racing expert, Natalie certain.</i>

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:27.980
<i>Thanks, Chick. Piston cup champion
Jackson Storm set a new record...</i>

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.780
<i>Today when he pulled off
the fastest lap ever recorded.</i>

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:34.700
<i>An unprecedented 213 miles an hour.</i>

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:37.410
<i>So what do you think, certain?</i>

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.080
Stormy boy gonna start the season
with another win?

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.750
Highly likely, Chick. Based on his
recent run times and forecasted...

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:46.420
Track temperatures on race day,
Storm's chances of winning...

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.920
- Are 95.2%.
- That low, huh?

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:54.370
And in case you missed it, talk of the
track tonight is Lighting McQueen...

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:59.090
Finding yet another way to embarrass
himself at a demolition derby.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.630
Almost makes me feel sorry for the guy.
Not really.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.550
Here's what his new sponsor had to say.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.300
Everyone, relax. The 95's gonna race.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:11.180
Lighting's just taking a somewhat
unconventional approach to this race.

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:12.720
It's one of the things
his fans love about him.

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.300
<i>Yeah, right! Talk about humiliating.
If I were old ka-chow...</i>

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.430
<i>I wouldn't even bother to show up
in Florida.</i>

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.930
<i>That could be for the best, Chick.
Even if he does race...</i>

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.730
<i>McQueen's probability of winning is 1.2%.</i>

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:29.730
<i>Numbers never lie.</i>

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.530
<i>I'm willing to predict tonight
that Lighting McQueen's racing...</i>

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.580
<i>Career will be over within the week.
It might even be over now.</i>

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.620
<i>I mean, I knew his career
was stuck in the mud...</i>

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.540
<i>first you find a can from a rusty Van
bump-bump</i>

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.380
<i>quicker than a dart, make it into art
bump-bump</i>

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.130
<i>that's the way it's done
it's a lot of fun</i>

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.130
<i>bump-bump</i>

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.630
<i>liftin' my funk
makin' sculpture outta junk</i>

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.930
what's that? There we go!
Somebody's interrupting genius!

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.810
- Well, hey, there, buddy!
- Mater!

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:08.350
You know, I was just thinking of you
and here you are lookin' right at me!

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:12.320
<i>You see me okay? Hang on a second
there. Hold on. Let me see here.</i>

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:14.440
<i>That better?</i>

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:20.070
Looking you straight in the eye there,
pal. Hey, sorry about calling so late.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.820
Shoot, not for me it's not.
I'm always burning that midnight oil.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:26.110
So get me caught up on everything.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.700
Well, actually kind of hoping I might
hear what's going on back home.

00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:34.460
Not much. If you don't count sarge
and Fillmore tryin' to run the tire shop.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.960
But tell Luigi not to worry,
sarge is gonna track down...

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.550
Every last tire
that Fillmore done gived away.

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.300
<i>Other than that, everything's good.</i>

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.050
- How's Sally?
- She's fine.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.890
<i>Keeping busy at the cone.
She misses you.</i>

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:50.760
<i>Well, shoot!
We all do when you're on the road.</i>

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:56.270
Yeah. You know,
I've been kind of thinking about that.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.730
You know, what we should do
when I'm not on the road anymore.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.820
<i>What do you mean not on the road?</i>

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:07.610
Well, you know.
Mater, I can't do this forever.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.580
I'm just not getting anywhere
with the training.

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.960
If anything,
I've gotten slower not faster.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.830
<i>Shoot, buddy, it'll work out.
Just tell me what the problem is...</i>

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.210
<i>And I'll stay right here with you
until we fix it.</i>

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:27.760
That's just it, mater. I don't know.
And I feel like I'm all out of ideas.

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.890
<i>All right, let me think.
You know what I'd do?</i>

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.600
<i>- What?
- I don't know.</i>

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:40.190
<i>I got nothin'. I guess I ain't Doc
when it comes to that.</i>

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:44.530
I would give anything
to talk to him right now.

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:47.320
<i>Yep, there was nobody smarter
than old Doc.</i>

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:49.200
<i>Well, except for maybe
whoever taught him.</i>

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.660
Yeah. Wait. What?

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.410
<i>Everybody was taught by somebody,
right? Take my cousin Doyle.</i>

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:58.120
<i>He taught me how to sing and whistle
at the same time.</i>

00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.710
<i>He was very musical that way.</i>

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:02.880
Smokey. Mater, you're brilliant.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:06.420
<i>Well...
It's all about the shape of your teeth.</i>

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:07.920
I got to go to thomasville.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:11.890
Oh, well, good. You know me, buddy,
I'm always happy to help.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:15.810
Think I am better at that than most folks.
You know, talkin' and stuff.

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:32.570
Hey, Cruz.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.990
You won't talk me out of this,
Mr. McQueen.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.620
I'm going back. I resign as your trainer.

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:42.170
All right. I accept your resignation. Bye.

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.750
Okay.

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:49.340
But since you cleared your calendar,
why don't you come with us?

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.550
I'm looking for someone named Smokey.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.050
Hoping he can help me.
Maybe he can help you too.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.560
Nah.

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.890
Come on. I fixed it.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.440
No. Thanks anyway. But I'm done.

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:08.150
Okay. But maybe this will change
your mind. Hit it.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.410
First I'm going to loosen up
these ancient joints...

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:15.660
- no, please don't.
- L'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:21.120
I'm sorry that I yelled. It wasn't
your fault that I almost got killed.

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:24.460
But now you're leaving
and you won't get on the ramp.

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.170
- All right, I'll go.
- You won't get on the ramp.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:26.920
All right, I'll go! Just stop!

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:34.300
How do you know Smokey's going to be here?

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.800
I don't.

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:39.060
Do you know if he's even alive?

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.730
Nope.

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:42.440
Okay.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:46.520
So tell me this: How do you know
if it's Smokey? Ls there such...

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:50.360
wait. Mack, pull over!
Back it up! Back it up.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.300
Good to see you, Doc.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.550
Hey, isn't that your old crew chief?

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:18.510
Hey, Cruz? You want to check out the
home track of the greatest racer ever?

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:26.060
Aren't we supposed to be looking
for Smokey? That's right, he's dead.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.020
We don't know that.

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:38.120
Are you sure you have time for this?

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:41.660
For this, I do.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.930
If this track could talk.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.940
Cruz, what do you say? Let's take a lap.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.150
Yeah!

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.630
Yes! You nailed it!

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.550
Way easier without the school bus of death
trying to kill us!

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.010
Yeah, no kidding!

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:02.280
Was starting to think
i might never meet you.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.160
Smokey?

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.000
He is alive.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:14.960
I know why you're here. You're thirsty.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:23.260
I'll tell you what, these folks are gonna
get a kick out of meeting Hud's boy.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:28.010
Who's Hud? Doc Hudson! Right.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.730
Hey! Act civilized. We got company.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.820
Hey, les.
How's that back axle treating you?

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.480
Hey, sugar, welcome to thomasville.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.950
- Would you look at that?
- What?

01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:46.370
Three of the biggest racing legends ever!

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.740
Junior "midnight" moon.
River Scott. Louise...

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:52.250
Louise "barnStormer" Nash?
She had 38 wins!

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:55.920
Well, as I live and breathe.
If it ain't Lighting McQueen.

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.130
Ms. Nash, it's a pleasure to meet you...

01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.420
you've had a tough year, haven't you?

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.590
Shouldn't you be running practice laps
in Florida by now?

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:06.340
- Yeah, sure, but...
- they're here to steal our secrets.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:08.140
Looking for your lost mojo?

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.100
You don't mince words around here, do you?

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.350
Truth is always quicker, kid.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.860
<i>But all he kept talking about was
glory days</i>

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:29.240
<i>they'll pass you by
glory days</i>

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:33.080
<i>in the wink of a young girl's eye
glory days</i>

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:36.000
<i>glory days</i>

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:37.630
guido, she's an angel.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:44.010
Lou won't admit this,
but she used to have serious eyes for Hud.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.670
Really?

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.550
Even if I did, it wouldn't have mattered.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.550
Hud didn't like fast women.
And that left me out.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.270
Old Lou wasn't just fast,
she was fearless.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.600
The second I saw my first race,
i just knew I had to get in there.

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:02.190
Of course, the fellas in charge didn't
like a lady racer showin' them up.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.900
So they wouldn't let me have a number.

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:05.320
What did you do?

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:06.820
I stole one!

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:07.910
What?

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:11.280
Life's too short to take no for an answer.
Right, river?

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:14.330
If we had waited for an invitation,
we might've never raced.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.910
And once we got on the track,
we didn't want to leave.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.710
I think that's how Doc felt too.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.880
You should've seen him when
he first came to town. Shiny blue paint.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:26.340
Notjust the Hudson hornet.
He was already calling himself...

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.800
The fabulous Hudson hornet.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.100
Did we ever ride him on that.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.180
Not for long.

01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:36.230
Hud was the fastest racer
this side of the Mississippi.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.850
Until he wasn't.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.350
What?

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.860
Everything changed
when the rookie showed up.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:52.450
<i>Took Hud all of no time
to work his way through the best racers...</i>

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.120
<i>In both carolinas.</i>

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.870
<i>Past river. Past Lou. Even junior.</i>

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.090
<i>But there was still the rookie
to deal with.</i>

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.970
<i>Tried slamming him into the wall.</i>

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.890
<i>But Hud never touched any wall,
unless he wanted to.</i>

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.940
That rookie never saw anything
like that before.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:30.320
- Doc did that?
- Are you kidding?

01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:33.660
Couldn't wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.750
Iwish I could've seen him like that.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:41.790
- Like what?
- So happy.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.930
You didn't come all this way
for a quart of oil, did you?

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.140
I need your help, Smokey.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:58.310
Yeah? What kind of help?

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.860
That's just it, I'm not sure.
All I know is if I lose in Florida...

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:10.110
It's over for me.
What happened to Doc will happen to me.

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:12.950
What did happen to him?

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.330
You know,
racing was the best part of his life.

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:20.200
And when it ended, he...

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:24.000
well, we both know
he was never the same after that.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.630
Is that what you think?

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:32.300
Come on. I want to show you something.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.220
You got the first part right.

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:45.310
The crash broke Hud's body
and the "no more racing" broke his heart.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.400
He cut himself off.
Disappeared to radiator Springs.

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.650
Son of a gun didn't talk to me
for 50 years.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.070
But then one day,
the letters started coming in.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.330
And every last one of them
was about you.

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:20.510
Yeah, Hud loved racing.
But coaching you?

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.340
I had never seen the old grump so happy.

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:31.350
Racing wasn't the best part of Hud's life.

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.230
You were.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.070
You ready to blow out
a little carbon there, boy?

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.030
Yes, I am!

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.030
You give it too much throttle,
you're in the tulips.

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:51.080
Hey, Lighting.
You might want to take notes on this one.

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:05.710
<i>You got a lot of stuff, kid.</i>

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:25.900
Hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.

01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:29.610
Are you ready to go find it?

01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:31.950
Yes, sir.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.740
All right, all right. Bring it back.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.750
Lesson one:
You're old. Accept it.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.420
- I told him that.
- He's probably losing his hearing.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:54.170
- He said you're old and losing...
- I heard him.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:58.180
You'll never be as fast as Storm,
but you can be smarter than him.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.680
Okay, what do I do?

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.140
They said you were in a demolition derby.

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.850
Yeah, it was terrible and I almost...

01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:07.440
are you sure?
Because there's not a scratch on you.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.430
Funny what a racer can do
when he's not over-thinking things.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.020
<i>Shannon spokes here at Florida
international, where Jackson Storm...</i>

01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:22.270
<i>Clocked 214 miles per hour today.</i>

01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:30.270
You want to beat Storm,
you need someone to stand in for him.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.940
Like a sparring partner.

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:35.940
I'm not so sure.
Not a racer. Just a trainer!

01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:37.030
Go ahead and gun it.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:43.490
Yeah!

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.040
With no muffler you even sound like Storm.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.960
You're going down, McQueen!

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.290
Get that arthritis-riddled keister onto
the track so I can put you into...

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.300
The old folks' home against your will!

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.840
How was that?

01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:59.180
- That'll work.
- Worked for me.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:00.890
- L'm good.
- Yep. That'll do.

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:01.720
Did you hear what she said?

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:07.020
You didn't show up in Florida for
qualifying so you'll be starting last.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.440
I'll give you three laps to catch her.

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:12.230
Go through
the entire field in three laps?

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:13.980
You want to beat Storm or not?

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:17.690
- Yes! Of course I do.
- Well, then, go!

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:20.490
Come on, kid.

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:34.370
All right.
Looks like we got some work to do.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.370
Look alive.
The reflexes are the first thing to go.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.670
Why are we in a field?

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.180
Sneak through that window!

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.930
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:50.760
Go!

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.520
Not cool, man. Not cool!

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:08.020
Let's run it back.

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:12.360
Do you even want to be out here?

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.200
Only two days left, kid.
You got to work harder.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:23.910
Wait, wait, who was that?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.870
I put McQueen in there.
Give you some real competition.

01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:34.210
Hud was a master of letting the other cars
do the work for him.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.970
He used to say
cling to 'em like you was two June bugs...

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.380
On a summer night.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.800
He stole that from me.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.720
Drafting? I've never had to do that.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:46.890
Yeah, that's when you were fast.
Now you're slow.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.560
- And old.
- And rickety.

01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:50.440
- And dilapidated.
- Okay! Okay, I get it.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.900
The new you
has to look for opportunities...

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.730
You never knew were there.

01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.070
Sneak through the window!

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.910
- Sneak through the window.
- What?

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.330
When a window opens, take it!

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:16.500
Yes.

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:20.170
- I made it!
- All right!

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.090
Let's go! Let's move!

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:25.390
Reflexes!

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.930
All right, guido, turn up the heat.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.100
Okay.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.530
All right, look who finally showed up.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.860
This is where we cut our racing teeth.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:46.490
In the woods?

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.790
Let's just say
the moon was always shining on us.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.500
If the moon didn't shine,
we didn't have to... never mind.

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:57.460
We ran moonshine, dummy!

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:01.800
By the way, no lights. Instinct only.

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:04.970
Yeah!

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:10.470
Yeah!

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:23.820
Yeah!

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:37.910
All right!

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.180
McQueen's still not here? Didn't he
pull this when he was a rookie?

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.220
At least that's what
my grandfather told me.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.850
All right, we got time for one last race.

01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:01.520
Hurry this along, boss,
we got to get you to Florida.

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:02.810
Go!

01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:10.690
Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up,
after how last season ended.

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:16.280
Let me put it this way.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:19.580
I'm not losing any sleep
wondering where Lighting McQueen is.

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:26.370
Come on, boy. Come on!

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.800
All right, McQueen. There you go, boy!
There you go.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.650
<i>McQueen is fading.
McQueen is fading. Fading fast.</i>

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.900
Yes!

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:06.410
Did you see that? That was...

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:16.750
sorry. I didn't mean to...

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:24.680
hey, boss, it's time to hit the road.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.930
Yeah.

01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:33.770
I want to thank everyone for the training.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.770
We better get going to Florida.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.370
<i>Welcome to racing's greatest day!</i>

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:53.450
<i>We're beach-side at
the Florida international speedway...</i>

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.830
<i>To kick off a new season of
piston cup racing. It's the Florida 500.</i>

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.460
<i>Forty-three cars and a quarter million
fans await today's intense contest of...</i>

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:03.630
<i>Strategy, skill, but most of all, speed.</i>

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.970
<i>This crowd is in
for one great day of racing.</i>

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.140
<i>I 'm Bob cutlass, joined as always
by my broadcasting partner...</i>

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:13.010
Darrell cartrip
and stat sensation Natalie certain.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:15.800
I've never seen the numbers line up
for Storm like they do today, Bob.

01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:19.850
Storm should be 96.8% unstoppable.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.270
<i>Well, don't overlook Lighting McQueen.</i>

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:24.060
Whipplefilter! Yeah-hoo!

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:27.480
<i>We've heard stories of the unusual way
McQueen trained to get here.</i>

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.570
<i>Now the question is did it work?</i>

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:44.580
Speed. I am... speed?

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:53.500
Hey, boss, they're calling the racers
to the track.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.930
Jeff gorvette,
how does today's talent stack up?

01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:01.510
I think we're in for a treat today.
These racers are...

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.350
hey, McQueen, win one for us old guys.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.180
Will do, Jeff.

01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:08.230
- Hey, there, buddy!
- Hey, guys.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:11.400
- Stickers.
- Hey, sal.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.030
- You okay?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.200
Listen, you're gonna do great today.
And no matter what happens...

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.240
I'm going to move onto the next rookie
and forget I ever knew you.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.370
I'm glad you're here.

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.250
Nice costume.
Come here, let's get a picture.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.540
It's so great to meet my number-one fan.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.340
What a jerk.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.380
- She's not a fan, Storm.
- Hey there, champ.

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:40.930
I heard you're selling mudflaps
after today.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.260
Is that true? Hey, you put me down
for the first case, okay?

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:59.570
Lighting! Lighting McQueen!

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.620
<i>- Hey, Lighting!
- Hey, Mr. Sterling.</i>

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.830
<i>To the future, eh, champ?</i>

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:08.410
Yeah. To the future.

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:12.670
<i>Hey, just focus on
what you're here to do, kid.</i>

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:14.460
Thanks, Smokey.

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:16.800
<i>Now, go make Hud proud.</i>

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.170
You got it.

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:20.260
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity,
let's go racing!</i>

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.760
<i>McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race.</i>

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.260
<i>Well, it won't be enough
to catch Storm.</i>

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:36.430
<i>Considering he started dead last...</i>

01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:38.770
<i>I don't think
he's doing half-bad out there.</i>

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.600
Not too shabby! You keep this up,
you'll finish in the top 10!

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:55.020
Top 10's not gonna cut it, Smokey.
I got to go all the way.

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:57.770
So dig in! Remember your training.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.820
Find Storm and chase him down!

01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:01.740
Tell him he has three laps to catch me!

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.280
Cruz says you've got
three laps to catch her.

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:06.160
Yeah, okay! Tell her, thanks.

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:16.240
- Cruz, what are you doing here?
- Mr. Sterling, I was just...

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:17.950
I'd like you to head back
to the training center right away.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.500
But why?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.960
I need you to get Kurt up to speed
for the race next weekend.

01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:25.960
Wait, not Kurt. He's the bug guy, right?
The other one... Ronald. Yes!

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.710
But I want to stay and watch.

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:29.500
That's not gonna happen, Cruz.

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:30.790
<i>Now go.</i>

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.920
But Mr. McQueen still has a chance...

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:34.420
just go do your job!

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.960
Yes, sir.

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:39.760
And take off that spoiler and those
racing tires. You look ridiculous!

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:43.560
You are a trainer, remember?
Not a racer!

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:48.980
If you were a racer, you'd know what
I'm talking about but you're not!

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.310
So you don't!

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.740
<i>No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.</i>

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.120
<i>I've wanted to become a racer forever!
Because of you!</i>

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:16.410
It was my one shot and I didn't take it.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:20.340
<i>It was my one shot and I didn't take it.</i>

01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:26.760
<i>Wreck in two. Wreck in turn two.
Go low. Go low.</i>

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.150
Kid, you okay?

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.820
Smokey, I need Cruz!

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.860
<i>- Never mind that now.
- No! I need her back here. Now!</i>

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.940
<i>The yellow flag still out, folks.</i>

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.200
<i>Wrecked cars everywhere.
We're still trying to figure...</i>

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.530
<i>Hamilton here.
Call from Chester whipplefilter.</i>

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.120
Chester... Mr. McQueen?

01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:00.450
The green light's on, pit road is open,
and everybody's coming in.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.830
Get ready, guys. Luigi, guido, tires!
Fillmore, fuel!

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.790
Okay, I'm here. What's going on?

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.960
No! Not me! Her.

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:11.800
What?

01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.720
- What is she doing back here?
- Come on, guys! Get her set up!

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.220
- Okay! Hot tires!
- Wait! What's happening?

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:18.010
<i>Hey, Ramona you got your pants'?</i>

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.560
- You know I do!
- Guys! What are you doing?

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.560
Man, I don't understand it!
McQueen's just sitting there.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.770
Something's got to be wrong.

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:26.860
Mr. McQueen?

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.900
Today's the day, Cruz.
You're getting your shot.

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:29.690
What?

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.320
I started this race
and you're gonna finish it.

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:36.610
What? She'll damage the brand!
She's just a trainer!

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.740
No, she's a racer.
Just took me awhile to see it.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.080
That can't be legal!

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:43.410
The rules only say
the number has to be out there.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.040
Doesn't say who has to wear it.

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:49.340
- No! You can't do that...
- did I tell you I love your mudflaps?

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.670
Out of my way, bumpkin!

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.800
Got my fishing flaps, got my church
flaps, my going out and eating flaps.

01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:59.550
Come on, guys!
We got to get her out there! Let's go!

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.930
- Tires, check!
- Fuel, check!

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:01.720
Ramone?

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:04.560
Best I could do in the time frame, boss.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.980
Yeah. That'll work.

01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:09.650
Why are you doing this?

01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:12.480
You said it yourself,
this might be your last chance.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:16.950
Which makes it my last chance
to give you your first chance, Cruz.

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:19.700
And this time I want you to take it.

01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:23.870
She's got to beat that pace car out.

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.620
- No! You can't do that!
- Now or never.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.880
What do you say?

01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:34.760
Hey! 35-mile-per-hour pit speed!

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.010
I knew that!

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:47.600
McQueen's team has entered
a different car sporting the 95.

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:48.980
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.440
You're watching this, right?

01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:54.530
What, the girl in the costume?
You're kidding me. He put her in the race?

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.400
The green flag is out
and we're back to racing.

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:13.370
Cruz? What are you doing?

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.660
<i>Come on. Pick it up!
You got to go faster.</i>

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:20.540
Call her Frances beltline and tell her
the school bus of death is after her.

01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:22.540
- What? No.
- Trust me.

01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:28.010
Frances beltline,
the school bus of death is after you.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.140
What? Right.

01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:34.760
Okay, that was different.

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:39.640
Cruz, you're looking too tight now.
Come on. Loosen up.

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.190
- Tell her she's a fluffy cloud.
- What? No.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.230
Smokey, tell her.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.780
Cruz, you are a fluffy cloud.

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:54.320
Right. Too tight.
I'm a fluffy cloud. I'm a fluffy cloud.

01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:01.410
Anticipate your turns.
Cruz! Get your head in the race.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:06.590
Tell her she's on a beach and all the
little crabbies have gone night-night.

01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:10.470
No! I ain't saying that. You tell her.

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:15.300
<i>All right, Cruz. The beach.
I need you to think of the beach.</i>

01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:17.930
<i>- Mr. McQueen?
- Yeah. It's me. Remember the beach.</i>

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.810
Pick a line, stick to it. Got it.

01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:25.190
All right. Not too bad.

01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:27.270
This is nothing like the simulator.

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:31.070
You got every tool you need.
Now remember thomasville.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.280
- Thomasville?
- Yeah. Sneak through the window.

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.200
Now that I understand.

01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:36.910
Sneak through the window.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:59.180
We're just learning that the racer
replacing McQueen is Cruz Ramirez.

01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.930
This is her very first race!

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.730
Actually, Darrell, it says here
she does have one win under her belt.

01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:07.020
At a place called thunder hollow?

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.230
Thunder hollow! She said thunder hollow!

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.400
Try moving half a Lane. Half a Lane.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.320
<i>- Got it.
- All right, watch that lap car.</i>

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:20.490
<i>He's gonna go high.
Go low! Go low! Nice job.</i>

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.200
You are smoking these guys.

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:25.960
<i>Now watch the tire marbles along
turn three. Keep your tires clean.</i>

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.710
- Okay.
- Bump coming up on the inside.

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.170
Careful you don't go airborne.

01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:30.500
<i>- Now'?
- Yes. Now!</i>

01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:33.840
<i>Watch out by the wall, it's a little slick
there. Watch it, watch it, watch it.</i>

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.970
You have hit a wall. You have hit a wall.

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.430
Ha-ha. Just being aggressive.

01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:47.850
<i>Okay, I want you to pit. Watch your rpm.</i>

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.440
Get out of the gas.
On the brake. On the brake.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:52.730
- Too fast!
- We're back here.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.740
Sorry.

01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:57.200
All right. Pick 'em off one at a time.
Go, go, go!

01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.870
<i>That's it. Nice and straight.</i>

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.670
Go, go, go, go! Smokey, you watching?

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:15.300
Just wanted to let you know
Ramirez is moving up toward you.

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:17.180
Why should I care?

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.760
<i>Because now she's in the top 10!</i>

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.520
Okay. Now you're coming up on the leaders.

01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:34.480
<i>- Ramirez up to fourth.
- In fourth?</i>

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:38.950
Get 'er done!

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.700
<i>Ramirez is in third.</i>

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.210
What are you doing, Storm?

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:58.170
Hey! Costume girl. You know,
at first I thought you were out here...

01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:59.760
Because your GPS was broken.

01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:01.140
Don't listen to him, Cruz!

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.260
You look good!

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:03.720
It's important to look the part.

01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:07.020
You can't have everyone thinking
that you don't deserve to be here.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.230
He's trying to get in your head!

01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:10.730
They don't need to know
what you and I already do.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.820
That you can play dress-up all you want,
but you'll never be one of us.

01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:25.990
Cruz, did you see what happened there?

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.660
Yeah. He's in my head.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:33.540
No! Listen to me. You got into his head.
Don't you understand?

01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:37.340
He would never have done that
if you didn't scare him.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.340
What?

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:41.380
<i>He sees something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.</i>

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:45.890
You made me believe it,
now you got to believe it too.

01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:49.390
<i>You are a racer.</i>

01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:51.520
Use that.

01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:05.450
<i>- And how far back is she now?
- Look behind you.</i>

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.280
What?

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:08.120
- Good evening, Storm!
- Wait, how did you...

01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:09.790
just back here drafting on your butt.

01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:11.210
Nothing to be concerned about.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.960
<i>Like two June bugs on a summer night.</i>

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.010
Hey, Hamilton.

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:21.130
<i>- Hamilton here.
- Call out our speed.</i>

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:24.390
<i>208 miles per hour, 207 miles...</i>

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.550
would you stop that?
You're taking me off my line!

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.720
- Last lap!
- Come on, Cruz!

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.310
My GPS is saying
i have slow traffic in my way.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.310
- No, you are not winning this!
- You're angry.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.270
I am not angry!

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:42.900
You know, you can use that anger
to push through.

01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:44.190
I said I'm not angry!

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:48.450
I don't think so! No!

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.700
Cruz, get out of there!

01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:56.540
You don't belong on this track!

01:28:57.870 --> 01:29:00.170
Yes, I do!

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:15.520
<i>I don't believe it.
It's Cruz Ramirez for the win!</i>

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.020
<i>I am speechless!</i>

01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:21.480
Nice finish, Cruz! You done it!

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:23.730
Cruz Ramirez!

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.070
- Yeah, there you go!
- Way to go, Cruz!

01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:27.780
Yes!

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.580
Man, heck of a win!

01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:40.870
Yeah. Heck of a win.

01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:47.910
- Hey, Cruz! You were flying!
- Thanks.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.750
- You really had it rolling today.
- That was cool.

01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:50.580
Thank you!

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:56.050
- Hey, Cruz, your blinker's on.
- It is? You got me! Very funny!

01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:06.060
Ramirez!

01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:09.020
Way to go, Cruz!

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.600
Go ahead. Give them some smoke.

01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:15.690
Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!

01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:28.490
You'll get used to that.

01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:30.740
Out of my way! Come on! Move it! Move!

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.490
Cruz! I knew you had something.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.950
And now look at you... a winner.

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.750
I could use you as a racer on our team.
We could make...

01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:43.880
sorry, Mr. Sterling.
I would never race for you.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:45.590
I quit.

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.920
- Well, then race for me!
- Tex!

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.090
Miss Cruz, I would be tickled pink
to have you race for team dinoco.

01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:57.430
As you know, we have a long history
of great racers, except for Cal.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.730
Guys, I'm still right here.

01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:01.730
Team dinoco, Cruz!

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:03.230
Hire her. I don't care.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.110
Lighting, now that you're retired...

01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:08.070
I need you first thing Monday morning
for a photo shoot.

01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:12.110
- Yeah, all right, Mr. Sterling.
- Hang on now.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.580
What? Why is my name up there?

01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:20.200
You started the race. That's how it works.

01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:21.710
Wait, wait, now... wait a minute. No!

01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:25.580
Lighting wins, he decides when
he's done racing. That was the deal.

01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:27.040
Hi, I'm his lawyer.

01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:28.800
That was the deal.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.340
You are not a nice guy.

01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:34.470
Although, I got to say, you do make
a quality mudflap at an affordable price.

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:38.760
Hey, Sterling.
Why don't you and I take a drive and talk?

01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:40.680
Billionaire to billionaire.

01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:44.060
Cruz, over here. Just one picture.
How does it feel to beat Jackson Storm?

01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:45.310
Take us through it, lap by lap.

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:49.400
It was great! Didn't expect this.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.070
Kid's got a lot of stuff, eh, Doc?

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.450
Well, she had a great teacher.

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:04.950
And now you get to decide
when you're done racing.

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:08.200
So what's it gonna be, stinky? Stickers.

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:15.790
I'm gonna keep racing. But before that,
i got something I want to do.

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:29.100
Welcome all to historic Willy's butte
for today's great exhibition of speed!

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.400
There she is! Cruz!
I love it. I love it. I love it.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.350
Thanks, guys!

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.320
Nice paint, kiddo.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:40.990
Pardon me. Big hat, coming through.
Get 'er done, 51!

01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:43.700
Great number. It was McQueen's idea.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.780
He felt Hud would've
wanted you to have it.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.700
I love it.

01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:50.000
It's perfect. It's very old-school.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.410
Did someone just say old-school?

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.330
Yeah!

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.460
Yeah! I like that.
It's bright, but I like it.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.050
- Looking fabulous.
- Favoloso.

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.220
Trying something new. I like it.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.680
Subtle.

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:12.560
Figured if I'm gonna be your crew chief,
i better do it in style.

01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:14.690
What's Mr. Sterling gonna say?

01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:18.190
I'm actually more worried about
what Tex is gonna say, considering he...

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.320
Bought rust-eze. Thanks, Tex!

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.740
I made that Sterling fella
a Texas-sized offer!

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.030
So, you ready to start training?

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.120
I don't know. You ready to lose again?

01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:32.620
Hope you've got your fluffy cloud.

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:34.040
I hope you got your drip pan.

01:33:34.210 --> 01:33:37.080
Got my drip pan and I've taken my nap.

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.170
Bring it on, old man.

01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:39.710
- Luigi.
- Go!

01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.090
<i>I live my life out on the edge</i>

01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:47.010
<i>yeah, I don't stop just 'cause it's red</i>

01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:49.810
<i>let's push this thing, see what we get</i>

01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:52.180
let's go, team dinoco!

01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:55.390
<i>This black pavement, these yellow lines</i>

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.610
<i>I pull exhaust into the night.</i>
