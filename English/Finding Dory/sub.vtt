00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.052
Hi. I'm Dory.

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:56.097
I suffer from short-term remembory loss.

00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:58.314
- Yes!
- That's exactly what you say!

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:02.234
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be the other kids now.

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.992
- Hi, Dory!
- Ahoy there!

00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:09.453
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.361
Okay. I love... Okay.

00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:13.828
We'll hide and you count and come find us.

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:14.702
Okay, Daddy.

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:19.826
No, not Daddy. I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend, okay?

00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:21.168
- Okay, Daddy.
- No.

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:24.172
- I'm hiding.
- Now count to ten.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:28.006
One, two, three...

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:31.263
Um, four...

00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:32.426
Um...

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.684
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:39.016
Mommy, can I go play with them?

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.564
- Dory. Dory. Dory, honey.
- Dory. Kelpcake.

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:43.396
Undertow, sweetie.

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:47.113
Remember, honey, we have to
stay away from the undertow.

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.435
Okay, sweetheart,
what about that rhyme we learned?

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:52.451
# We see the undertow and we say...

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.490
# Let's go

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:58.695
No. It's, "Heck no."
Okay? Let's try it again.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.580
# We see the undertow and we say...

00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:03.628
# There's the undertow!

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:06.418
# There's the undertow
There is the undertow

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:10.586
# Hey, you found the undertow
And we see the undertow #

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:16.048
- Did I forget again?
- No, no. No.

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:17.967
- No, sweetie. Don't worry about it.
- No biggie, kelpcake.

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:24.478
What if I forget you?
Would you ever forget me?

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:26.608
Oh, kelpcake, no.

00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:31.573
We will never forget you, Dory.
And we know you'll never forget us.

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:13.323
Hello?

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:16.781
Hello!

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.489
- Did you hear that?
- What's that? Hear what?

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.199
- Stan, I just heard someone say hello.
- I didn't hear anybody say hello.

00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:26.001
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:30.301
There's a lot of fish here.
Anybody could have just said hello.

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.631
- Hello?
- There.

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:33.131
- Where?
- There. There. Right there.

00:03:33.298 --> 00:03:34.378
- Where am I looking?
- There!

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.429
- Oh.
- Hello!

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.351
- Hello?
- Oh, my goodness, it's a child!

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.719
- Hi, kid. Over here. Hello?
- Hello? Hi.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.560
Hi. I'm Dory. Can you please help me?

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:49.476
Hi, Dory. Are you lost?

00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:52.107
- Yeah, where are your parents?
- Um...

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:54.031
I can't remember.

00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:55.904
- Oh.
- Well we'll look around.

00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:57.857
Are any of these fish your parents?

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.831
Hi, I'm Dory. Can you please help me?

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:08.325
- What?
- Um...

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:12.341
- Honey, you just said that.
- Mmm.

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:14.884
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.930
I'm sorry. I suffer from
short-term remembory loss.

00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.854
- Oh, how awful.
- Short-term memory loss?

00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:25.774
Okay, you wait here for one second.
Okay, sweetie pie?

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.350
- Stan. Stan. Stan.
- What? What?

00:04:27.518 --> 00:04:29.018
What do we do? The poor thing is lost!

00:04:29.187 --> 00:04:31.187
- What do you want me to do?
- We have to do something.

00:04:31.356 --> 00:04:34.186
- She can't remember a thing!
- She could come from anywhere.

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:38.859
Wow, you are no help today.
Dory? Sweetie? How about we...

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.950
She's gone.
Well, that's not good. Hey, Dory!

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.236
- Dory!
- Dory!

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:49.246
I'm Dory. I lost my family.
Can you help me?

00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:55.131
I'm Dory. I suffer from
short-term memory...

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.885
# Just keep swimming
Just keep swimming

00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:09.136
# Just keep swimming
Swimming What do we do? #

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:18.356
Hi. I lost my family. Can you help me?

00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:19.904
Where did you see them last?

00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:24.031
Well, uh, funny story, but I forgot.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.078
Oh, sweetie,
do you want to come swim with us?

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:29.214
That is the nicest offer
I've gotten all day.

00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:31.248
I think. Uh, I can't remember.

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:34.246
Anyhoo, thanks,
but I'm looking for someone.

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:39.127
Oh. Can't remember. Can't remember.
Can't remember.

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:43.385
Hi! I'm Dory.

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:44.759
Was it something I said?

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:47.929
Kidding. Okay, you're not coming back.

00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:52.807
I was looking for something and I...
Okay, get it. Date night. Have fun.

00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.021
Well, I hope you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.860
You and me both. Any idea what that was?

00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:00.447
I'm sorry.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.490
I'm sorry.

00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:07.622
Okay. Guess we'll hang out another
time. Don't be a stranger, Stranger.

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:14.134
Huh?

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:17.712
A white boat! They took my son!

00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:20.665
My son! Help me! Please!

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:21.798
Watch out!

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:27.215
Oh! Oh, sorry! Are you okay?

00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:29.135
- He's gone. He's gone.
- There, there.

00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:30.347
- No, he's gone.
- It's all right.

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:31.806
- He's gone.
- It'll be okay.

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:35.016
No, no, they took him away.
I have to find the boat.

00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:37.194
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat!

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:38.396
- You have?
- Uh-huh.

00:06:38.483 --> 00:06:40.153
It went this way! Follow me!

00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:43.318
Thank you! Thank you. Thank you so much!

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.381
Klaus. Klaus, the pinata's drooping.

00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:09.056
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
I can fix it. Ow!

00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:15.942
Hey, Marlin?

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:20.479
Oh. Hey, guys, I was just...

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:21.566
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:25.861
Dory! It's not time to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.200
And remember, the anemone stings.

00:07:28.366 --> 00:07:30.616
Oh, right. Yeah. Sorry.
Back to bed, back to bed.

00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:36.541
Hey, Marlin? Ow!

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.207
Back to bed! That was it.
Very simple. Bed. Back to it.

00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:40.335
Mmm, got it.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.800
Hey, Marlin?

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:47.125
And we're up. That's it.
Ready to start the day.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.390
- And we were looking for something.
- Nemo.

00:07:49.554 --> 00:07:51.934
Right. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:07:52.098 --> 00:07:53.928
Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:58.982
Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

00:07:59.063 --> 00:08:00.903
Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:03.395
No. No, there were definitely four.

00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:04.988
But last time you told it,
there were three.

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:07.572
Son, which one of us travelled
across the entire ocean?

00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:09.278
Nemo did.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:11.075
Obviously we had to cross the ocean...

00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:13.162
to find him, so you know... He went first.

00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:18.581
I guess that's true. Isn't it?

00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:23.964
Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.590
A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:28.757
- I thought you told her.
- I did tell her!

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:30.596
- Uh... Dory.
- Yeah.

00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:35.931
Mr Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.100
Uh-huh.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:42.904
So it would be best if today
you weren't exactly with the class.

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.074
Oh. Why not?

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:47.321
Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.196
That's the one thing I can remember. Yes.

00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:53.332
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:57.499
And Mr Ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:00.502
In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:03.125
Poor guy. You know, he's so overworked.

00:09:03.294 --> 00:09:04.714
- You understand.
- I totally understand now.

00:09:04.837 --> 00:09:05.297
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

00:09:05.463 --> 00:09:07.723
He wants me to be the teacher's assistant.

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:09.932
Uh... No, not exactly.

00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:12.971
I am so honoured. I have never been
a teaching assistant before.

00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:16.473
Mr Ray! You got help.

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:20.654
Oh. Okeydokey.

00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:24.478
- All right, kids.
- All right, kids.

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:26.069
- Today's the day!
- Today's the day!

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.823
Our field trip to the sting ray migration.

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:29.736
Sting ray migration.

00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:31.994
Now, does anyone know why we migrate?

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:35.198
Come on. You got to know this stuff.

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:38.118
Migration is about going back to...

00:09:38.204 --> 00:09:39.294
- Bed!
- Yes!

00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:40.162
- No.
- No.

00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:44.341
- The sand!
- No! Migration is about going home.

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:46.002
- Home.
- Which is where you're from.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:46.840
Where you're from.

00:09:47.004 --> 00:09:48.094
Can someone tell me where they're from?

00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:51.514
- I live by a giant rock.
- I live 3 coral caves away from here.

00:09:51.676 --> 00:09:53.176
My house is covered in algae.

00:09:53.344 --> 00:09:54.684
Where'd you grow up, Dory?

00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:57.845
Me? Um, I don't know.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.893
My family. Where are they?

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:08.026
Can I help you?

00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:10.779
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
You see, I suffer from...

00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:12.525
Short-term memory loss.

00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:16.275
How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:19.907
Good question. See, I can remember
some things because well...

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:22.709
They make sense.
Like, um, I have a family.

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:25.333
I know because I've... I must have
come from somewhere. Right?

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.539
Everyone has a family.

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:28.917
I may not remember their names
and what they look like.

00:10:29.088 --> 00:10:31.298
And I may not even be able to
ever find them again, but, um...

00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:34.637
- What were we talking about?
- Mommies and daddies.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.390
Mommies and daddies. Right.

00:10:36.554 --> 00:10:40.394
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh!

00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:43.268
That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay.

00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:46.226
You guys seem a little young,
but, um, okay.

00:10:46.397 --> 00:10:49.067
You see, kids,
when two fish love each other...

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:51.443
And we'll stop right there.

00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:56.742
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration song coming on.

00:10:56.907 --> 00:11:01.447
Oh...

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:05.079
# Migration, migration
let's learn about migration

00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:09.089
# It's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea

00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:13.173
# Here's a scientific promise
That a fish who's Oceanodromous

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.260
# Where did everyone go? I'm by myself
Oh, there they are. I'm back

00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:20.468
# Plus or minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning #

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.309
Oh, kids stay away from the edge.

00:11:22.475 --> 00:11:24.595
Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody
stay back from the edge. Come on.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:26.439
- Okay, that's too far.
- That's too far.

00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:28.524
Come on. Come on.
Get back over here. Back this way.

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:31.776
- Now, I need everyone to listen to me.
- All right, listen up!

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:34.452
- When the rays pass through here...
- The rays, gonna pass through.

00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:36.282
What do we have to be careful of?

00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:37.947
Everybody has to be careful of what? Hmm?

00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:40.445
- The undertow!
- That's right.

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:43.164
That's right. The under... The undertow?

00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:49.127
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:51.463
And if you're not careful,
you can get pulled into...

00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:54.669
Mr Ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.970
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

00:11:57.134 --> 00:12:01.314
Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.

00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:07.232
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!

00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:09.653
# To and fro, our hearts know where to go

00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:12.654
# Beating like a drum
it sends us back to where we're from

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.994
# Oh... we're going home

00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:18.413
# We know who we are...

00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:19.659
# And it's time to travel far

00:12:19.824 --> 00:12:23.664
# For days and nights we'll roam,
to make our way back home

00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:26.618
# Oh... we're going home

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.917
- # Swimming to and fro,
- Wow!

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.839
# Our hearts know where to go

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:34.088
# Beating like a drum, it sends us back
to where we're from #

00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:37.965
We see the undertow and we say...

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.090
Dory!

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:41.176
Dory!

00:12:44.557 --> 00:12:45.467
Dory! Dory!

00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:49.186
- Is she dead?
- No, she's not dead.

00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:51.691
- Aw. Oh, man.
- Give her some space, everybody.

00:12:51.814 --> 00:12:54.824
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:57.532
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California?

00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:00.357
I remembered something so I...

00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:02.618
I remembered something!

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:04.331
I actually remembered something!
Something important.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.451
Something important? What? What was it?

00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:10.367
Uh... I'm not sure any more,
but I can still feel it. It's right there.

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:12.041
All right, thank you, Mr Ray.

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.629
Okay, come on. Try to remember better.
Don't be such a Dory, Dory.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:19.586
Hmm. I don't know. I... Hold on. Hold on.

00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:22.854
- Uh... Oh. Oh!
- What? Did you remember?

00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:25.385
Ugh, I don't remember.
It was something... It was...

00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:28.636
Oh, oh, oh! It was something about the...

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.727
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.895
My family! I remember my family!

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:37.895
They're out there somewhere.
I have to find them.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.568
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys! Guys! Hello?

00:13:41.572 --> 00:13:43.662
Guys! Where are you?

00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:45.081
- Dory!
- Hello?

00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:47.582
- Dory!
- Ah! Where did you go?

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.922
- You were the one to go.
- My parents. I remembered them.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.501
What? What did you remember?

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:54.746
I remembered them! My mom. My dad.

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:58.759
I have a family. Oh! They don't know
where I am. Let's go. We have to go.

00:13:58.923 --> 00:14:02.343
Dory, no. No! This is crazy!
Where exactly are you trying to go?

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.969
To the Gem of the Baltic?

00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:07.467
- The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
- Yes!

00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:09.728
No, Dory. California's all the way
across the ocean.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:10.850
Then we'd better get going.

00:14:10.935 --> 00:14:14.765
How come every time we're on the edge
of this reef, one of us is trying...

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:17.609
to leave?
For once, can't we just enjoy the view?

00:14:17.775 --> 00:14:20.355
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family?

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:23.656
No! We've done our ocean travels.
That part of our lives is over.

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:26.122
The only reason to travel
in the first place is so...

00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:28.453
- you don't have to travel ever again.
- Yeah, but I want to...

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.750
- Dory, look...
- Please.

00:14:32.665 --> 00:14:37.285
All I know is that I miss them.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.720
I really, really miss them.
I didn't know what that felt like.

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.465
Do you know what that feels like?

00:14:52.977 --> 00:14:55.647
Yes, I know what that feels like.

00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:02.901
I don't want to forget this.
Somewhere out there is my family.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:09.239
Please, Marlin,
I can't find them on my own.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.660
I'll forget.
Please help me find my family.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.420
Yeah, Dad, you can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:18.134
No.

00:15:21.714 --> 00:15:23.594
But I know a guy.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.140
Whoo-hoo!

00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:30.809
Righteous, righteous, righteous!

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:52.493
Totally sick. Totally sick.

00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:54.081
I know. Isn't it great?

00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:56.576
No! I'm gonna be totally sick.

00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:59.539
It's the California current, dude.
It's got some gnarly chop.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.170
Surf's up, dude!

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:05.215
Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl,
just do me a solid...

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:08.432
head to the back of the shell,
lean out, and go for distance.

00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:10.604
We call that "feeding the fishes."

00:16:10.763 --> 00:16:11.933
Correctamundo, Squirt!

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:15.977
And now we're looking for my parents
at the Brooch of the Atlantic? Or the...

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.150
- The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
- Exactly!

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.688
How are you gonna find your parents?

00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:21.645
Do you remember what they look like?

00:16:21.774 --> 00:16:23.614
I'm a bit new to the memory thing,
so I can't say for sure...

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:27.402
but something tells me they were
mostly blue, with s... Maybe yellow.

00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:28.241
That sounds right.

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:31.985
Also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know
them when I see them. We're family.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.867
By the way crossing the ocean
is the kind of thing you should...

00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:37.037
only do once. One time!

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:39.626
Morro Bay, California's coming up, dudes.

00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.921
Whoo-hoo! Let's find my family.

00:16:43.087 --> 00:16:44.247
Go! Go! Go, go, go.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.671
- Just go, Dad.
- Don't push me, Nemo.

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:52.139
Whoo-hoo!

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:55.601
So long, Little Blue!
Hope you find your parents.

00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.596
And good luck "feeding the fishes."

00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:00.604
Too late. Already fed.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:01.979
Oh.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.451
This feels familiar. Mom! Dad!

00:17:09.613 --> 00:17:11.373
No. Dory! Dory! Wait! Wait.

00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:13.946
Mom! Dad!

00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:16.698
Stop yelling for a second.
Do you really think your parents...

00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:19.247
are just gonna be floating around here
waiting for you?

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:22.674
Well, I don't know, but there's only
one way to find out. Mom! Dad!

00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:25.455
- Yell louder, Dory.
- Mom! Dad!

00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:27.339
- Sh!
- What was that?

00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:32.755
Wait. I've heard that before.
I remember someone saying, "Sh."

00:17:32.928 --> 00:17:34.888
Yes, well done. That was me.
One minute ago.

00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:35.642
Sh!

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.689
Please. Have you seen my mommy and daddy?

00:17:40.853 --> 00:17:43.113
Their names are Jenny and Charlie.

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:43.858
Sh!

00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:47.904
Jenny and Charlie.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:48.856
What? Jenny and what?

00:17:48.944 --> 00:17:51.864
Those are their names!
My parents are Jenny and Charlie!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.570
- Dory, wait!
- Jenny!

00:17:53.657 --> 00:17:55.987
Can't we just take a moment
to come up with a plan?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.450
- Jenny! Charlie!
- Sh!

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.830
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, she's a little excited.

00:18:00.998 --> 00:18:03.708
- Jenny! Charlie!
- Dory, stop yelling for a second.

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:06.504
It's not a good idea
to come into a new neighbourhood...

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.050
and call this much attention to yourself.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:12.184
You don't understand. I remembered
my parent's names! Jenny! Charlie!

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:16.012
These crabs are locals and I
get the feeling they're shushing...

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.850
us for a reason. You might wake up
something dangerous.

00:18:18.974 --> 00:18:21.064
Are you talking about like
something with one big eye...

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.096
tentacles, and a snappy thing?

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:24.857
Well, that's very specific,
but something like that, yes.

00:18:25.022 --> 00:18:27.022
You just in general don't want to...

00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:32.568
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

00:18:32.738 --> 00:18:37.198
There's a mistake. We're backing away.
Let us live and we will...

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:41.867
We'll worship you. We'll build a...
Do you like a monument?

00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:54.295
Oh! Ooh! Whoa! Swim for your life!

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.355
- Nemo!
- Nemo!

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:15.323
Dad!

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.527
- Nemo!
- Dad!

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:23.746
No!

00:19:23.914 --> 00:19:26.254
Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go!

00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:27.924
Dad!

00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:29.247
No, no! No!

00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:38.224
Dory! Dory, slow down!
We're not being chased any more.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:39.258
Are you sure?

00:19:43.267 --> 00:19:46.437
Jenny and Charlie. Jenny and Charlie!

00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:50.109
I just remembered their names!
We have to keep going. We're so close.

00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:51.404
- Huh?
- Nemo, are you hurt?

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:55.105
Oh, my goodness! Nemo!
Are you okay? What happened?

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.949
- Not now, Dory. Please!
- Oh, no.

00:19:57.114 --> 00:19:59.454
- Nemo. Oh, no. Oh, no.
- I'm okay.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.576
Oh, Nemo. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry.

00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:04.963
Oh, my goodness! Nemo, are you okay?

00:20:05.122 --> 00:20:07.082
I said, "Not now." You've done enough.

00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:12.499
I have? Oh, no. But I can fix it.
I can. I'll go get help.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.131
You know what you can do, Dory?
You can go wait over there.

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:18.889
Go wait over there and forget.
It's what you do best.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.470
You're right. I don't know why I thought
I could do this.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:29.021
Find my family. I can't do this.
I'm so sorry. I'll fix it.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.937
- I'm okay.
- Well, I'm gonna get help. Okay?

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:35.146
Okay? I can do that. I'll be...
It'll be all right, Nemo.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.660
Hello? Someone? Hello?

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:43.704
Anyone? Hello? Anyone?

00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:45.329
Hello.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.866
- Hello?
- I'm Sigourney Weaver.

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.881
Oh. Hi, Sigourney. I need your help.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.002
Won't you please join us...

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.549
Oh. Great, great, great.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.974
As we explore the wonders
of the Pacific Ocean...

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:02.394
and the amazing life it holds within.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:04.724
Witness the majesty of the Beluga Whale.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.350
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:07.515
Dory! There you are!

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.354
Guys! I found help. Sigourney Weaver's
gonna tell us where we are.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.690
Look out!

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.515
- Oh, look at this!
- No respect for ocean life.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.859
- Marlin! Nemo!
- Dory!

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.065
No, no, no. Not again! Not again!

00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:19.735
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:23.369
Dory! Dory!

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.203
Don't worry, Dory! Stay calm.
We'll come find you!

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.870
And welcome to
the Marine Life Institute...

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.250
where we believe in Rescue,
Rehabilitation and Release.

00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:38.045
Marlin? Nemo?

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:46.178
Hello? Hello? Can you help me?

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.178
Me help you?

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:49.893
Ugh.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:52.895
Oh.

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:58.361
Huh? What's happening? Help?

00:21:58.527 --> 00:21:59.687
Looks like we're done here.

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.111
Dude, cut it out. You're a scientist.
We talked about this.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.620
Oh, come on. It's funny.

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.456
Oh, boy. Okay. This is...

00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:14.881
I'll be fine, I just need to find
a way out and...

00:22:23.969 --> 00:22:26.929
If I could just... Get a hold
of yourself, get a hold of yourself.

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:29.927
You'll be fine, everything's fine,
think positively.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.850
- Hey, you.
- Oh.

00:22:31.977 --> 00:22:32.807
Spinner.

00:22:32.978 --> 00:22:35.438
Oh, thank goodness. Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...

00:22:35.564 --> 00:22:37.484
Name's Hank. How sick are you?

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:38.779
Sick? I'm sick?

00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:39.942
Why else would you be in quarantine?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.070
Oh, no! How long do I have?
I have to find my family.

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:44.815
All right. Now don't get hysterical...
Uh-oh. Not good.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.620
What? What is it? What happened?
What's that?

00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:49.334
That there is bad news.

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:52.829
It's a transport tag for fish
who can't cut it inside the institute.

00:22:52.998 --> 00:22:56.128
They get transferred to permanent digs.
An aquarium.

00:22:56.293 --> 00:22:57.883
In Cleveland.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.180
Fish in here, go back in the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.

00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:05.932
Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:08.934
I have to get to the Jewel of Morro Bay,
California and find my family.

00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:10.927
That's this place.
The Marine Life Institute.

00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:13.847
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
You're here.

00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:15.154
You mean I'm from here?

00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:17.646
My parents are here.
I have to get to them.

00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.024
So what exhibit are you from?

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.150
Wait. I'm from an exhibit?
Which one? I have to get there.

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:24.449
Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.

00:23:24.613 --> 00:23:28.783
Unless... Nah. Never work. It's too crazy.

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:30.949
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:34.117
You know, I could see that?
Well, there's one thing I can think of...

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:37.209
to help you get to your family.
If I just take...

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.455
Yes! Great idea. You take me to find them.

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:40.634
Why didn't I think of that?

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:43.665
Uh, no, no, no. If I just take your tag...

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.510
I can take your place on the transport
truck then you can go back inside...

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.847
and find your family.
All you have to do is give me the tag.

00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:53.064
What tag? There's a tag on my fin!

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:55.643
How could you forget
you have a tag on your fin?

00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:59.689
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I...
I suffer from short-term memory loss.

00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:02.113
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:04.903
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:07.858
Um, you were about to give me your tag.

00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.161
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:11.203
So I can go to...

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:14.329
So I can go to Cleveland.

00:24:14.496 --> 00:24:16.834
Cleveland? Mmm. I hear good things
about Cleveland. Why do you want to go?

00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:19.167
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

00:24:19.334 --> 00:24:21.504
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:25.261
I just want to live in a glass box alone.

00:24:25.423 --> 00:24:28.053
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:29.548
Hey, man, don't touch my tag!

00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:33.522
Look...

00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:42.896
I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.

00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:44.276
A map! Good idea.

00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:47.492
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh, boy.

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:52.116
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me...

00:24:52.242 --> 00:24:55.872
I don't have much. Um, I...
How about if I give you this tag?

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.365
Great idea.

00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:06.629
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?

00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:09.588
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:10.759
- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?

00:25:10.927 --> 00:25:12.717
You said that, Dory swam to the surface,

00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:14.104
and she got taken by some...

00:25:14.264 --> 00:25:15.394
All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

00:25:15.557 --> 00:25:18.767
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that...

00:25:18.935 --> 00:25:22.765
I'm not positive I did.
It's actually a compliment because...

00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:25.939
I asked her to wait and I said,
"It's what you do best."

00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:29.109
So I... Oh, it's my fault!

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:33.119
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:34.913
What if it's a restaurant?

00:25:35.076 --> 00:25:37.406
Oy! You two! Shut it!

00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:41.419
Yeah, we're trying to sleep!
You interrupted my favourite dream!

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.293
Is that the one about you
laying on this rock?

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.800
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is a good one.

00:25:45.962 --> 00:25:47.632
- Oh, yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
- It's one of my favourites.

00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:48.467
Uh, excuse us. Hello!

00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:49.298
- Son! Son.
- We're trying to...

00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.643
Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.

00:25:52.802 --> 00:25:53.852
They could pounce at any moment.

00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.599
Uh, they don't look very pouncy.

00:25:57.766 --> 00:25:59.306
That's what they want you to think.

00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:02.146
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.

00:26:02.312 --> 00:26:05.732
Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?

00:26:07.192 --> 00:26:10.652
Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.950
- She is?
- It's a fish hospital.

00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:17.374
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.

00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:19.535
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:21.294
- Nasal parasite.
- Anaemia.

00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:23.036
All fixed up and sent on our way.

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.246
Oh, thank goodness.

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:28.376
Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab...

00:26:29.464 --> 00:26:31.634
- Gerald, get off the rock!
- Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off!

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.680
- Get off! Now you know better! Off!
- Off! Off! Off! Off!

00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:40.675
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the Marine Life Institute.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.940
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

00:26:43.061 --> 00:26:44.941
She was right.

00:26:45.021 --> 00:26:47.191
It looks like Dory
can do something besides forget.

00:26:47.357 --> 00:26:49.147
Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.

00:26:49.317 --> 00:26:51.357
So how are we gonna get inside?

00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:53.026
Wait. You want to get inside MLI?

00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:55.866
Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.

00:26:56.032 --> 00:26:58.202
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

00:26:58.368 --> 00:27:01.408
Oh, we know a way.

00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:02.708
You do?

00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:05.251
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo.

00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:08.205
- What are they doing?
- I don't know. It sounds bad.

00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:11.342
- Are we there yet?
- Sh. Keep it down!

00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:15.296
Hank, I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like... I... Destiny.

00:27:15.552 --> 00:27:18.352
For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.

00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:20.773
Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?
I'm sorry.

00:27:20.932 --> 00:27:23.022
I'm just so nervous
because I'm gonna meet my parents.

00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:25.404
I haven't seen them in I don't even know
how long because...

00:27:25.562 --> 00:27:27.732
- you see I suffer from short-term...
- Short-term memory loss.

00:27:27.897 --> 00:27:29.517
Look, no more talking. Okay?
I don't like talking.

00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:32.071
I don't like chatter and questions.
And, "How are you? Oh, I'm fine."

00:27:33.278 --> 00:27:35.408
"How are you? I'm fine too."
News flash -nobody's fine.

00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:37.527
Oh, I'm fine. How are you?

00:27:37.615 --> 00:27:39.615
- Hank, look, there's a map!
- Sh!

00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:42.412
The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.

00:27:42.579 --> 00:27:44.409
Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?

00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:46.751
Got it. What was the first part again?

00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:48.206
Ugh.

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:49.424
What? The octopus escaped again?

00:27:49.544 --> 00:27:52.134
Wow. Look at all the exhibits.

00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:54.255
How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.

00:27:54.424 --> 00:27:55.724
- Pick one!
- Okay. Um...

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:58.429
Well, tell everyone to keep an eye out.

00:27:58.595 --> 00:28:02.215
We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:07.597
Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.690
Hank! There you are.

00:28:09.814 --> 00:28:11.324
- Hurry up!
- Okay. Okay.

00:28:11.482 --> 00:28:16.742
K. It starts with a "k."
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone!

00:28:16.905 --> 00:28:18.815
No! No kids. Kids grab things.

00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:20.777
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.490
You lost a tentacle?
Well then you're not an octopus,

00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:24.828
you're a septopus.

00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:26.326
I may not remember, but I can count.

00:28:26.497 --> 00:28:27.787
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:31.376
Journey to the... Hey, look. Shells.

00:28:33.963 --> 00:28:35.383
Hey, look. Shells!

00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:38.471
Daddy, here's a shell for you.

00:28:38.635 --> 00:28:41.135
That's great, Dory. You found another one.

00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:43.354
- I did?
- Oh, yes, you did.

00:28:43.514 --> 00:28:44.934
You're getting good at this, Dory.

00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:49.482
Hey, look. Shells!

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.070
- Hey, I live there.
- Yes! Yes, indeed.

00:28:54.192 --> 00:28:57.492
- I like shells.
- That's right, dear.

00:28:59.155 --> 00:29:01.315
Do you think you could find me
another shell?

00:29:02.033 --> 00:29:03.663
Purple ones are my favourite.

00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:07.157
Okay, Mommy.

00:29:08.831 --> 00:29:11.631
Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell!
Hey, my home had a purple shell.

00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:16.165
So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:18.169
No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:20.931
Purple shells were her favourite
and she had this adorable giggle.

00:29:21.052 --> 00:29:22.302
And then my dad was really friendly.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.850
And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.

00:29:28.184 --> 00:29:29.484
Still think this is destiny?

00:29:29.644 --> 00:29:31.154
- Hank, we have to find my folks!
- Quiet!

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.240
Ugh. Base, this is Carol.

00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:44.526
Uh, I think I might have found
that missing octopus. Over.

00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:46.906
- See what you did?
- Sorry.

00:29:47.078 --> 00:29:48.408
This could not be worse.

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:52.749
Hmm. "Destiny." Destiny.

00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:55.547
- Hank. I got a feeling.
- Sh!

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.710
I think we should get in the bucket.

00:29:56.879 --> 00:29:59.049
- No. Stop.
- Seriously. It says "destiny" and it is...

00:29:59.215 --> 00:30:00.755
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We've got to get in that bucket.

00:30:00.883 --> 00:30:05.183
- I'm not going with you in that bucket.
- Here... I... go... in... the... bucket. Bye.

00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:12.398
Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea. Play dead.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.490
I'm sorry. I got to blink. How do you
hold your eyes open that long?

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.790
Hey, guys. Wait a second.

00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:46.603
Our next guest
has been here a very long time.

00:30:46.763 --> 00:30:50.773
She's a whale shark. Her name is Destiny.

00:30:50.892 --> 00:30:52.142
Destiny? Really?

00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:55.308
You'll notice she's extremely
near-sighted and has trouble...

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.730
navigating her environment.
Oh! And here she comes now.

00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:03.359
Ooh! Destiny. You're a fish?

00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:06.699
Wait. What?

00:31:06.824 --> 00:31:09.834
- Hi! Hello there.
- Whoa! Oh. Whoa.

00:31:11.287 --> 00:31:12.957
All right, I'll go with you.

00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:17.291
- Excuse me.
- Is that blue blob talking?

00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:19.798
- Can you help me? I lost my family.
- You lost your family?

00:31:19.962 --> 00:31:21.212
Well, it's a long story,

00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:23.007
and truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.

00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:24.722
- Aw, that is so sad.
- You poor thi...

00:31:28.137 --> 00:31:31.467
Sorry. Not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.

00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:33.061
Oh, I think you swim beautifully.

00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:35.142
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

00:31:35.311 --> 00:31:37.021
Thank you.

00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:39.646
You're welcome.

00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:40.936
Wait. Say that again.

00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:43.987
Um, you're welcome.

00:31:44.153 --> 00:31:45.663
- Dory?
- Yes.

00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:46.822
- Dory?
- Yes.

00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:47.908
- Dory?
- Yes.

00:31:48.032 --> 00:31:49.622
- Dory!
- Yes.

00:31:49.742 --> 00:31:51.912
- You and I were friends!
- No!

00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:53.996
- Dory, it's me! Destiny!
- You know me?

00:31:54.163 --> 00:31:56.833
Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

00:31:56.999 --> 00:31:58.629
- We were pipe pals!
- We were?

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.050
- Aw, you're so pretty.
- So you know where I'm from?

00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:04.093
Yep, you are from the Open Ocean exhibit.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.010
I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit?

00:32:06.175 --> 00:32:07.755
Then that's where my parents are.

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:09.104
We got to go. Can you take me there?

00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:11.932
Uh... Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:15.388
Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.

00:32:15.476 --> 00:32:16.476
Who's that?

00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:17.601
That's my neighbour, Bailey.

00:32:17.687 --> 00:32:19.017
He was brought in with a head injury.

00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:20.268
I know you're talking about me, Destiny.

00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.569
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

00:32:22.733 --> 00:32:24.783
the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:26.864
Hear every word you're saying about me.

00:32:26.988 --> 00:32:28.028
What's echolocation?

00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:31.117
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

00:32:31.284 --> 00:32:36.334
find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:38.285
Now I know you're talking about me.

00:32:38.374 --> 00:32:40.214
- I really can't echolocate.
- Oh.

00:32:40.376 --> 00:32:42.086
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

00:32:42.253 --> 00:32:45.303
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

00:32:45.464 --> 00:32:47.764
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

00:32:47.925 --> 00:32:49.675
Echolocation.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.310
Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

00:32:52.388 --> 00:32:53.558
- What?
- What are glasses?

00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:55.471
It's sort of like you go, "hoo"

00:32:55.558 --> 00:32:58.348
and then you see things.
Why do I know that?

00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.897
Oh. That's interesting.

00:33:03.566 --> 00:33:06.276
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

00:33:06.444 --> 00:33:08.954
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

00:33:09.113 --> 00:33:11.163
Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the...

00:33:11.324 --> 00:33:14.164
What's it called? The place...
The soap and lotion?

00:33:14.327 --> 00:33:15.997
- Open Ocean.
- Open Ocean!

00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:18.622
Open Ocean! I know where that is.

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:21.919
That's the exhibit located right next to...
I don't care.

00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:22.924
Easy!

00:33:23.002 --> 00:33:25.922
If you're trying to get to the Open Ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

00:33:26.088 --> 00:33:28.298
- Through the pipes. Great.
- Through the pipes?

00:33:28.466 --> 00:33:30.466
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

00:33:30.635 --> 00:33:34.715
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's...
Did you get that, Hank? All that?

00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:36.767
- Uh, yeah.
- Great! Let's go.

00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:40.346
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.020
Um...

00:33:44.106 --> 00:33:49.146
That's... I'm... I... See, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.370
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:54.491
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

00:33:54.659 --> 00:33:57.499
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.540
- Not my problem. Tag!
- But I can't get in that way.

00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:03.665
- I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
- There's no other way.

00:34:05.628 --> 00:34:08.968
- There's no other way.
- Now, now. Don't panic.

00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:13.181
It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:17.474
She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.560
- Charlie!
- A joke. I'm kidding!

00:34:19.725 --> 00:34:23.345
Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.

00:34:23.521 --> 00:34:24.811
Joke. I got it.

00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:28.151
You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.

00:34:30.194 --> 00:34:31.704
Thank you, Daddy.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.489
Thank you, Daddy.

00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:37.163
Nope. My father said
there's always another way.

00:34:37.243 --> 00:34:40.833
- What? There is no other way.
- Open Ocean. Open Ocean. Hmm...

00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:44.083
Open Ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:47.416
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:49.546
- Wait, what?
- Always another way. There's...

00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:53.684
There! Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.

00:34:53.843 --> 00:34:55.183
- Open Ocean.
- Exactly.

00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:59.518
Um, guys.
You know I can't swim over there, right?

00:35:00.433 --> 00:35:03.193
Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.

00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:05.596
I don't see how this
is going to get us inside.

00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:06.938
What are you even doing?

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:08.856
We're calling her over, of course.

00:35:09.025 --> 00:35:10.775
Calling her over? Calling who over?

00:35:15.448 --> 00:35:17.618
Lads, meet Becky.

00:35:19.702 --> 00:35:23.462
Flying? No, no, no new information.

00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:25.082
Listen, tell her thank you.

00:35:25.207 --> 00:35:27.377
You guys have gone
above and beyond. Really.

00:35:27.543 --> 00:35:31.763
But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?

00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:33.222
Because that's really our strength.

00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:36.012
Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.

00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:38.045
That's where they take the sick fish.

00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:41.814
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.

00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:46.345
Hi, Becky.

00:35:46.437 --> 00:35:49.267
Ow! Stop. Let's call
her Pecky because this is hurting.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.780
I think she likes you, Dad.

00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:55.911
Becky, love? These two nice fish
need to get into quarantine.

00:35:56.072 --> 00:35:57.912
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

00:35:58.032 --> 00:36:01.792
Becky, is... Would that work
with your schedule? Ow!

00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:03.702
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:06.419
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.170
- Imp... What?
- Imprint.

00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:12.424
Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo"
and she'll be in sync with you.

00:36:12.588 --> 00:36:15.668
- Now look her in the eye.
- Yeah.

00:36:15.758 --> 00:36:19.758
Nemo, I think we should
devise an alternate plan.

00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:22.599
One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.

00:36:22.765 --> 00:36:25.805
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!

00:36:25.976 --> 00:36:28.766
That's fine, Dad. And in the meantime,
Dory will just forget us.

00:36:28.938 --> 00:36:30.818
Like you said, it's what she does best.

00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.611
Fine.

00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:35.033
Uh...

00:36:35.111 --> 00:36:39.571
Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye?

00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:40.948
Just pick one, mate.

00:36:41.117 --> 00:36:41.947
Becky.

00:36:44.036 --> 00:36:45.036
Uh...

00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:51.919
Ooh. Ooo-roo. Roo-roo, Becky.

00:36:54.672 --> 00:36:57.172
Okay, this is all great.

00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:01.554
How exactly is Becky supposed to carry us?

00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:05.469
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald!

00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:07.231
- Hmm?
- Yeah, Gerald.

00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:08.813
- Come on, son.
- Hmm?

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.820
Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail,
we'll let you sit on the rock.

00:37:13.983 --> 00:37:16.653
- Yeah, Gerald. We swear it.
- Hmm.

00:37:18.487 --> 00:37:21.237
That's right. Shimmy on over here.

00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:23.407
Come on. You can do it.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.240
That's right.

00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:26.871
Mind you don't scuff your bum.

00:37:29.665 --> 00:37:32.415
Thank you so much, Gerald.

00:37:32.585 --> 00:37:35.205
Welcome to your time on this rock.

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.375
Comfortable, isn't it?

00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:40.758
Time's up! Get off!

00:37:40.843 --> 00:37:42.603
- Off! Off! Off! Off!
- Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off!

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.310
No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?

00:37:47.433 --> 00:37:48.483
Good luck!

00:37:53.272 --> 00:37:54.902
Okay, when I tell you you're gonna...

00:37:55.065 --> 00:37:56.935
Yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal
with a big splash.

00:37:57.109 --> 00:38:01.199
On my mark. Not clear yet. Not clear yet.

00:38:02.156 --> 00:38:04.406
- Now?
- Not 'til Destiny gives the signal.

00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:09.081
You know something? I have no idea
why you're even doing this.

00:38:10.206 --> 00:38:11.036
What do you mean?

00:38:11.207 --> 00:38:13.037
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.

00:38:13.209 --> 00:38:15.039
If I had short-term memory loss...

00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:17.051
I'd just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.

00:38:17.213 --> 00:38:18.883
Well I don't want to do that.
I want my family.

00:38:19.048 --> 00:38:21.088
Not me, kid. I don't want anyone
to worry about.

00:38:21.634 --> 00:38:25.554
You're lucky. No memories. No problems.

00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:28.641
Huh. No memories. No problems.

00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:32.141
Still not clear. Still not clear.

00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:33.651
You don't have to say when it's not time.

00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.152
- Not...
- Just tell me when it is time.

00:38:35.314 --> 00:38:37.074
Okay, here we go. And... Wait!

00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:38.902
"Here we go. Wait." Are you serious?

00:38:39.068 --> 00:38:40.688
- Okay, on the count of three.
- Don't count. Just say, "Go."

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:42.569
- Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it!
- What? Okay, okay.

00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:45.445
- Wow. Look at that! I mean...
- That's the signal.

00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:47.494
Go, go, go! That's the signal!

00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:55.174
Now remember,
Destiny said follow the signs

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.920
- to the Open Ocean exhibit.
-Uh-huh.

00:38:57.086 --> 00:39:00.586
I can't see squat,
so it's your job to look for it.

00:39:00.756 --> 00:39:02.586
Got it. Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:03.628
I'm just gonna repeat it, okay?
That should work.

00:39:04.468 --> 00:39:06.968
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

00:39:07.096 --> 00:39:10.176
Mm. Go right! Follow the signs
to Open Ocean.

00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:13.769
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Left!

00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:15.846
- Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
- And steer clear of people, will you?

00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:18.191
Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:19.823
Sh! Do not mess me up!

00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:25.864
Oh, poor baby.
Let me get that for you. Here you... Oh!

00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:28.446
Oh, my. Ugh.

00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:31.445
Where do we go? Where do we go?

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.500
Oh, sorry! Okay, I was looking, looking...

00:39:34.665 --> 00:39:37.415
Roo-roo, Becky!
Drop us anywhere. We're okay.

00:39:37.543 --> 00:39:40.673
Just wait, Dad. I think she's looking
for a place to land.

00:39:40.838 --> 00:39:44.508
She's confused, Nemo. She doesn't
even know which way to look.

00:39:50.973 --> 00:39:54.693
Wait, Becky. What are you doing?
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo.

00:39:56.562 --> 00:39:59.982
Okay. I was going somewhere.
The question is where.

00:40:00.149 --> 00:40:01.819
Which way? Do you see the sign?

00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:05.404
I'm looking. I'm looking. Something to
something gets me to my family!

00:40:05.571 --> 00:40:08.121
"The world's most powerful pair of..."

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.240
I know that. Why do I know that?
It's another memory.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.040
Hank, we need to go that way!
Left. Go left.

00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:20.457
Becky! Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:22.836
She can't hear you, Dad.

00:40:22.963 --> 00:40:26.843
All right. New plan. We have to get
closer to Becky so she can hear us.

00:40:27.843 --> 00:40:29.683
I don't think we should move the pail.

00:40:30.304 --> 00:40:33.854
Nemo. Without me Becky's lost.

00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:36.019
Dad, just trust her.

00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:39.061
Trust her? So she can forget us
all together?

00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:42.859
- I trust Becky.
- You trust her? Becky's eating a cup!

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.200
Becky! Becky! Ooo-roo! Whoa!

00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:53.043
Ah.

00:40:57.414 --> 00:40:59.254
Well, at least we're not stuck
in the bucket any more.

00:41:03.921 --> 00:41:05.551
Or on top of quarantine.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.300
The baby otter talk is beginning now.

00:41:08.467 --> 00:41:12.887
Why, thanks, Sigourney Weaver.
Hey, who wants to learn about otters?

00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:16.389
Looking for the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:17.885
Otters!

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.150
- Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party!
- Cuddle party! I'm in!

00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:25.067
Where are we? Are we close to Open Ocean?

00:41:25.234 --> 00:41:27.614
Uh, yes. I think... Well, I don't know.
But I saw that other sign so...

00:41:27.778 --> 00:41:28.738
What? What other sign?

00:41:28.904 --> 00:41:30.244
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.

00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:33.115
What? What are you talking about?
Why would we follow that sign?

00:41:33.242 --> 00:41:35.452
Well, because I remembered it.

00:41:35.577 --> 00:41:37.327
No. That wasn't the plan. Ow!

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:42.334
All right, that's it!
You have wasted my time!

00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:44.497
- Wait. No.
- That transport truck leaves at dawn...

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.460
and I'm not missing it,
so give me your tag.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.090
Wait. No, I remembered that sign.

00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:49.837
- So?
- So I'm remembering more...

00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:52.255
and more and I feel like my memory's
getting better. I think we should...

00:41:52.427 --> 00:41:55.097
No! Your memory is not working.
You can't remember anything.

00:41:55.264 --> 00:41:57.934
It's probably how you lost your family
in the first place!

00:42:00.811 --> 00:42:04.691
All right, look, let's just take it down
a notch. Just give me the tag and...

00:42:04.857 --> 00:42:08.107
You know something, for a guy
with three hearts you're not very nice.

00:42:08.277 --> 00:42:10.487
Three hearts? What are you talking
about? I don't have three hearts.

00:42:10.571 --> 00:42:11.741
- Yes, you do.
- I don't!

00:42:11.822 --> 00:42:12.612
- You do!
- Don't!

00:42:12.781 --> 00:42:13.911
- Do!
- Stop saying that!

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:17.162
Fun fact... the octopus has three hearts.

00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:19.454
Two pump blood to the gills
while the third pumps...

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.910
- blood throughout the body.
- Wait!

00:42:20.998 --> 00:42:22.288
Whoa!

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.840
You know, someone with three hearts
shouldn't be so mean.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.380
And it's mean to say that
I would lose someone I love!

00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:33.891
I did not lose them! Hank?

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.850
Hank? Hank?

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.310
- Han-s.
- No. Not Hans. I'm looking for Hank.

00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:43.646
- Han-s.
- Hank. With a "k." Hank.

00:42:43.812 --> 00:42:46.942
- Hands!
- Hands? Oh, oh, oh, hands!

00:42:50.027 --> 00:42:52.607
Hank! Hank?

00:42:52.738 --> 00:42:53.698
My arm!

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.490
Hank!

00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:58.992
Where are you? Hank!

00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:01.787
Oh! Ahh! Can you please help me?
I'm looking for...

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:06.336
Please help me. I've lost
my friend Frank. I'm sorry, not Frank.

00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:07.591
You're in my space!

00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:11.053
He's an octopus. No, septo...
Septopus. That's right.

00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:13.804
He's a septopus. Septopus.
Septopus. Septopus.

00:43:13.884 --> 00:43:16.894
One, two, three, four, five, six, s...
Septopus! He's camouflaged!

00:43:20.015 --> 00:43:22.265
Hank. Come on, Hank!
Let's get out of here.

00:43:22.434 --> 00:43:24.024
Dory, what are you doing?

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.899
Hank! What's the plan?

00:43:28.065 --> 00:43:30.185
The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever.

00:43:30.359 --> 00:43:31.649
Okay. Good plan.

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:37.235
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry.
I can't remember right.

00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:39.991
- Sweetie. Sweetie.
- Oh, watch out, kelpcake.

00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:41.368
Oh, watch where you're going.

00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:46.575
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.

00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:51.208
Oh, sweetie.
Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.800
You know what you need to do?
Just keep swimming.

00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:56.967
Yeah.

00:43:57.135 --> 00:44:00.255
And I bet you can remember
that because we're just...

00:44:00.722 --> 00:44:01.722
Um...

00:44:01.807 --> 00:44:03.227
We're gonna sing a song about it.

00:44:03.392 --> 00:44:06.232
# Just keep swimming
Just keep swimming

00:44:06.395 --> 00:44:08.935
# Just keep swimming
Swimming, swimming

00:44:09.106 --> 00:44:10.976
# What do we do?
We swim

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:14.069
# Swim, swim, swim
We swim

00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:16.816
- # We swim, swim, swim
- # Just keep swimming #

00:44:19.616 --> 00:44:21.536
My parents taught me that song!

00:44:21.618 --> 00:44:22.988
We sang it as a family.

00:44:23.161 --> 00:44:24.581
All this time I thought I made it up!

00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:26.416
- What song?
- Just keep swimming.

00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.581
Hank, we've just got to keep swimming.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:32.050
What? No way! Listen to me,
it's too dangerous to move.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.010
No, you listen to me. I know
you're scared, but you can't give up.

00:44:35.132 --> 00:44:36.172
Follow me.

00:44:36.341 --> 00:44:38.801
# Just keep swimming
Just keep swimming

00:44:39.928 --> 00:44:42.348
# My mom wrote this song for me

00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:45.273
# It's gonna get us out of here #

00:44:45.434 --> 00:44:46.854
Sing with me, Hank. Come on.

00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:49.805
I'm coming, Mommy. I'm coming, Daddy!

00:44:49.938 --> 00:44:51.608
- We're gonna be okay.
- Stop!

00:44:51.773 --> 00:44:53.153
- Huh?
- Turn back.

00:44:53.275 --> 00:44:54.475
Turn back!

00:44:54.651 --> 00:44:57.531
You're headed right for Poker's Cove.

00:44:57.612 --> 00:44:59.492
Poker's Cove.

00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:02.328
- Poker's Cove?
- Incoming!

00:45:05.454 --> 00:45:06.964
Stop it!

00:45:07.122 --> 00:45:08.622
Oh, what is this?

00:45:12.794 --> 00:45:13.634
Sorry.

00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:16.125
That's okay. Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

00:45:21.303 --> 00:45:24.063
Hank? Oh, Hank. There you are.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.390
Wow. You got us out of there.

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:30.229
Huh. I did.

00:45:31.938 --> 00:45:33.228
I got us out of there.

00:45:34.191 --> 00:45:35.361
I mean, technically
you also got us in there.

00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:39.529
But if you hadn't I'm not sure
we would have gotten here.

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:45.043
Echolocation. Echolocation!

00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:48.622
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses. We found it!

00:45:48.747 --> 00:45:50.867
No. You found that.

00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:59.009
Welcome to the Open Ocean.

00:46:00.008 --> 00:46:01.088
Home.

00:46:03.595 --> 00:46:08.345
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo.
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

00:46:08.475 --> 00:46:10.435
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:12.272
Dad, stop. She's not coming back.

00:46:12.437 --> 00:46:13.897
She might. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.110
Dad! You made her feel like
she couldn't do it.

00:46:23.198 --> 00:46:25.198
You're not talking about Becky, are you?

00:46:27.536 --> 00:46:28.906
I miss Dory.

00:46:29.538 --> 00:46:30.788
Me too.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.800
The truth is,
I'm just so worried about her.

00:46:38.547 --> 00:46:40.377
She's the one who should be worried
about us.

00:46:41.049 --> 00:46:44.049
Well, she would definitely have an idea
of what to do if she were here.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.390
I don't know how she does that.

00:46:46.555 --> 00:46:50.385
I don't think she knows, Dad.
She just does.

00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:53.229
Well, then we'll just have to think.

00:46:54.563 --> 00:46:56.903
- What would Dory do?
- What would Dory do?

00:46:57.065 --> 00:46:58.975
Yeah! What would Dory do?

00:46:59.651 --> 00:47:02.451
She would assess her situation,
and then she'd evaluate...

00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:04.322
then she would analyse her options...

00:47:04.489 --> 00:47:07.079
Dad, that's "what would Marlin do."

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.580
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.

00:47:09.744 --> 00:47:11.834
She would just look at the first thing
she sees and...

00:47:24.593 --> 00:47:25.763
Dory would do it.

00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:28.679
Mmm.

00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:31.682
Nemo, hold on to me.

00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:32.766
Whoa!

00:47:35.312 --> 00:47:36.522
Whoo-hoo!

00:47:36.605 --> 00:47:37.805
Hey, it's working! Whoa!

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.280
Just keep gasping.

00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:55.828
- Are you okay?
- Yeah! What would Dory do now?

00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:57.039
Who's Dory?

00:47:58.335 --> 00:48:00.455
Oh, boy. Are we happy to see you.

00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:02.875
Happy to see me? I'm happy to see you!

00:48:03.048 --> 00:48:05.678
I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.

00:48:05.842 --> 00:48:07.512
Years? Wow.

00:48:07.594 --> 00:48:09.724
Unfortunately we can't stay long.
We have to go because...

00:48:09.888 --> 00:48:12.518
Now why would you want to go?
You just landed.

00:48:12.682 --> 00:48:15.642
Stay a while. Tell me all about yourself.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.520
I would love to, but my son and I
have to get to quarantine, so...

00:48:18.688 --> 00:48:20.728
- Wonderful thing to have a son.
- Yeah it is.

00:48:20.899 --> 00:48:23.989
Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.

00:48:24.152 --> 00:48:25.992
- That's fascinating, but...
- But scallops have eyes.

00:48:26.154 --> 00:48:28.204
And she was looking for something
different. I'm kidding!

00:48:28.365 --> 00:48:30.325
Well, not about scallops having eyes.
They do.

00:48:30.492 --> 00:48:32.742
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.

00:48:32.911 --> 00:48:37.251
Oh, Shelley! Why? Why?

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:38.745
Now what would Dory do?

00:48:40.085 --> 00:48:41.375
Come with us as we explore

00:48:42.587 --> 00:48:45.507
the mysterious world of the Open Ocean.

00:48:47.217 --> 00:48:49.677
- Okay, Hank, follow me.
- You're in a cup.

00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:51.264
Right. I'll follow you then.

00:49:03.525 --> 00:49:06.525
- Wait.
- An octopus has three hearts.

00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:08.907
Huh. That's a fun fact.

00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:21.629
We're here. This is really happening.

00:49:21.709 --> 00:49:22.789
Sh!

00:49:33.263 --> 00:49:36.773
Well, looks like this is it, kid.
Now I got a truck to catch.

00:49:36.933 --> 00:49:39.273
Wait! Wait! I had something for you.

00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:45.071
- Tag.
- The tag. Right!

00:49:51.948 --> 00:49:55.238
You know, I think I'm gonna remember you.

00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.082
Oh, you'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.

00:50:00.582 --> 00:50:01.832
Three heartbeats.

00:50:03.168 --> 00:50:04.838
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.

00:50:10.258 --> 00:50:11.968
My parents are actually down there.

00:50:16.473 --> 00:50:17.563
Um...

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.770
You okay?

00:50:20.268 --> 00:50:21.188
I'm ready.

00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:24.766
Yeah, I think you are.

00:50:25.106 --> 00:50:26.106
Whoa!

00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:31.948
Wow!

00:50:35.825 --> 00:50:39.945
Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they? Okay. Okay.

00:50:45.627 --> 00:50:50.757
Pardon me. Oh. Hi. Hello. Have you
seen a mom and a dad without me?

00:50:50.924 --> 00:50:52.684
Excuse me. Have you seen a couple?

00:50:52.759 --> 00:50:53.969
They're old like you.

00:50:54.135 --> 00:50:56.675
Not old like you, but older than you even.

00:50:56.763 --> 00:50:57.813
Okay. Bye.

00:50:57.972 --> 00:51:03.142
Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid
a long time ago that would be me?

00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:06.441
I don't know how long ago exact...
Okay. You're in a hurry.

00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:08.784
- Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.
- Oh, sorry.

00:51:15.782 --> 00:51:19.372
It's our goal that every animal
we rescue and care for...

00:51:19.536 --> 00:51:21.996
will eventually return home
to where they belong.

00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:28.171
Shells.

00:51:28.336 --> 00:51:32.296
And there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, Dory...

00:51:32.465 --> 00:51:34.215
You just follow the shells.

00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:35.844
Hey, look! Shells!

00:51:43.518 --> 00:51:45.478
Follow the shells.

00:51:57.365 --> 00:52:00.155
- Hey, I live there.
- Yes, yes indeed.

00:52:01.244 --> 00:52:03.664
My home. That's my home!

00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:06.829
Mom! Dad!

00:52:08.376 --> 00:52:11.046
Okay, kelpcake. Now count to ten.

00:52:11.921 --> 00:52:14.551
One, two, three...

00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:16.796
Four...

00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:19.715
You're welcome.

00:52:19.887 --> 00:52:21.597
Who are you talking to, kelpcake?

00:52:21.764 --> 00:52:23.524
My pipe pal, Destiny!

00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:30.395
Mom? Dad?

00:52:39.574 --> 00:52:41.284
Mommy loves purple shells.

00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:52.915
- Mommy?
- What's going to happen to her?

00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:54.837
There, there, Jenny.

00:52:55.423 --> 00:52:58.013
Oh, no, don't cry, Mommy. Don't cry.

00:52:58.092 --> 00:53:01.182
Do you think she's... That she can
make it on her own, Charlie?

00:53:01.262 --> 00:53:04.222
Oh, honey. It'll be okay.

00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:08.774
Mommy loves purple shells.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.570
- Dory!
- Dory?

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.330
- Dory!
- Mommy?

00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:26.406
- Dory!
- Mommy! Daddy!

00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.002
My parents...

00:53:32.293 --> 00:53:34.503
I... I lost them.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:44.810
It was my fault.

00:53:45.807 --> 00:53:47.477
- Where's your tag?
- Huh?

00:53:47.642 --> 00:53:51.442
Your tag. It's missing.
That why you're not in quarantine?

00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:52.732
- Quarantine?
- Yeah!

00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:55.975
That's where they took all
the blue tangs. Isn't that right, Bill?

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.150
Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.490
Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn. Must be nice.

00:54:02.615 --> 00:54:04.945
What? No! No, my parents
are back in quarantine?

00:54:05.118 --> 00:54:07.868
They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just got here!

00:54:08.037 --> 00:54:09.707
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

00:54:09.872 --> 00:54:12.332
Don't worry,
it's easy to get to quarantine.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.170
You can just go through the pipes, honey.

00:54:16.504 --> 00:54:19.094
Oh. Oh, I can't do that.

00:54:19.799 --> 00:54:22.299
- Why not?
- I'll forget where I'm going.

00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:25.638
And I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.

00:54:25.805 --> 00:54:28.675
- Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
- You're not helping, Bill.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.350
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

00:54:35.273 --> 00:54:36.483
Oh, boy.

00:54:37.066 --> 00:54:40.986
Could you tell me how to get there?
Through the pipes?

00:54:41.154 --> 00:54:45.164
Sure, honey. It's two lefts
and then a right. Simple.

00:54:49.162 --> 00:54:50.662
Okay.

00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:55.544
Two lefts and a right. I can do this.

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.550
Two lefts and a right. Okay. Don't forget.

00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:06.345
Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:11.390
Two lefts and a right. Two lefts
and a right. Two lefts and a right.

00:55:13.269 --> 00:55:17.229
Two lefts and a right? Shoot.

00:55:18.441 --> 00:55:22.361
Left and a right. Wait.
Did I already take a left?

00:55:22.487 --> 00:55:26.867
Oh, no. It's happening. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:30.911
Which way? Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.

00:55:31.078 --> 00:55:32.658
Okay. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.

00:55:32.747 --> 00:55:33.917
I'm forgetting everything.

00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:37.921
I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes! The pipe pals.

00:55:38.044 --> 00:55:40.594
Pipe pals? Pipe pals!

00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:44.295
- And... swim, swim, swim.
- Yeah, I don't know about this.

00:55:44.467 --> 00:55:46.837
Trust me,
I won't let you hit anything. Wall!

00:55:48.054 --> 00:55:49.974
What's the point?
I'll never learn to get around!

00:55:50.056 --> 00:55:52.806
You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.

00:55:52.892 --> 00:55:55.142
Now really focus, okay? Wall!

00:55:55.311 --> 00:55:56.811
Destiny!

00:55:56.979 --> 00:55:58.769
Dory? Hello?

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.650
I'm lost in the pipes
and my parents are in quarantine!

00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:06.159
Hang on, Dory! Bailey!
You've got to use your echolocation!

00:56:06.322 --> 00:56:07.162
You know it's broken!

00:56:07.323 --> 00:56:09.783
Just stop it, and try the "Ooh" thing
Dory talked about, will you?

00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:11.949
- But I don't think I can...
- Don't bail on me, Bailey!

00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:15.997
Ooh!

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.460
Ooh! Ooh!

00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:21.626
Come on, Bailey. What did you
just tell me, huh? Really focus!

00:56:21.796 --> 00:56:23.166
Ooh! I feel stupid.

00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:25.469
- Bailey.
- Sorry. Ooh!

00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:27.093
- Hello?
- Here!

00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:29.136
We're here!

00:56:29.303 --> 00:56:32.933
- Guys... Ooh! Guys... Ooh!
- What? What is it?

00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:37.225
I'm getting something! Ooh!
Here we go! Ooh! Oh, yes! Ooh!

00:56:37.854 --> 00:56:41.984
I can see the quarantine! This is amazing!

00:56:42.108 --> 00:56:46.068
Ooh! I can see everything!
And I can see you!

00:56:46.153 --> 00:56:47.953
He can see you!

00:56:48.114 --> 00:56:50.034
My life's a rainbow! Can you see me?

00:56:50.116 --> 00:56:52.196
Right, it doesn't work that way.

00:56:52.368 --> 00:56:54.498
- Bailey!
- Okay! Tell Dory to go left!

00:56:54.662 --> 00:56:56.042
He says go left!

00:56:56.205 --> 00:56:57.575
Left?

00:56:59.208 --> 00:57:01.418
- Ooh! Straight!
- Straight!

00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:03.342
- Straight!
- Ooh! Go right!

00:57:03.504 --> 00:57:05.174
- Right!
- Right!

00:57:06.007 --> 00:57:09.047
Ooh! I'm light-headed! Ooh! Wait. Ooh!

00:57:09.218 --> 00:57:11.508
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on! Let me zoom out.

00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:13.256
Zzz...

00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:15.467
Holy Neptune, she's not alone! Ooh!

00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:17.638
- What is it?
- I can't tell! But it's coming for her.

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:21.358
Oh, no! Dory, swim! Swim the other way!

00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:22.942
- What? Where?
- What? Where?

00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:24.605
- Go right!
- Right!

00:57:26.611 --> 00:57:29.031
No, my right!
Oh, no! She's heading right towards it!

00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:31.026
No! Dory, turn around!

00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:35.367
That's great, Dory!
You're headed right toward us!

00:57:35.536 --> 00:57:37.196
What? You want me to go right?

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.790
No! No! Not right. Oh, I can't look!

00:57:43.044 --> 00:57:44.554
- Dory!
- Marlin?

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.050
- I knew it! You're okay!
- Oh, my gosh!

00:57:46.213 --> 00:57:50.053
It's consuming her! It's eating her alive!

00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:54.219
- You're okay!
- You found me! How did you find me?

00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:56.558
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

00:57:56.724 --> 00:57:59.894
We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.

00:58:00.061 --> 00:58:01.561
And then we just started looking.

00:58:01.729 --> 00:58:04.399
Dory! I'm sorry!

00:58:04.565 --> 00:58:06.065
Okay, what was that?

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:07.573
Hang on. I got to take this.

00:58:07.735 --> 00:58:10.445
It's okay! Sorry for what?

00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:12.571
What? You're okay?

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.240
- Yes!
- I found Marlin and Nemo!

00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:18.119
Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

00:58:18.287 --> 00:58:19.367
I heard.

00:58:19.455 --> 00:58:22.035
It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.

00:58:22.208 --> 00:58:26.048
I say we go this way.
Follow me. It's time to head home!

00:58:26.587 --> 00:58:30.007
Wait, wait, wait! Um...
My parents are here.

00:58:30.132 --> 00:58:31.932
- They are?
- You found your parents?

00:58:32.093 --> 00:58:36.433
Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet,
but, um, I know where they are.

00:58:36.597 --> 00:58:40.887
I don't know exactly how to get there,
but I know that... I'm getting help...

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.770
- Down to quarantine.
- Quarantine.

00:58:42.937 --> 00:58:46.607
That's it! Oh, and I met
this septopus, super cranky...

00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:51.784
but secretly kind of sweet, and he
got me into the exhibit... The exhibit.

00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:55.281
Dory?

00:58:56.117 --> 00:58:58.287
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

00:58:58.452 --> 00:59:00.792
What? Why wouldn't they want to see you?

00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:04.792
Because... I lost them?

00:59:05.793 --> 00:59:09.763
Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:13.629
They're going to have missed...
everything about you.

00:59:13.801 --> 00:59:16.141
- Really?
- Do you know how we found you?

00:59:16.303 --> 00:59:18.143
- Something about a clam? Or...
- No.

00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:19.135
- No, an oyster.
- No.

00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:20.346
- Mollusc?
- No.

00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:21.176
- Something?
- No.

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.600
- I don't... No?
- No clam.

00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:25.478
We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

00:59:25.646 --> 00:59:27.646
"What would Dory do?"

00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:29.482
Why would you say that?

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:32.650
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:37.030
stuff I never dreamed of doing.
Crazy things!

00:59:37.867 --> 00:59:41.367
Outsmarting sharks and jumping jellyfish.

00:59:42.538 --> 00:59:46.828
And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

00:59:48.044 --> 00:59:52.884
Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.

00:59:54.133 --> 00:59:57.343
No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

00:59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.349
And I'm sorry about that.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:08.481
But, Dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:16.033
And when you do that, you'll be home.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.042
Dad.

01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:33.261
Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to Dory?

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:37.224
Yes, Nemo. We do.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:59.239
Hey, so how much more we got left to load?

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.906
Uh, just this last row.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.445
The sooner we finish, the sooner
this truck gets to Cleveland.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:06.211
- Watch the turn.
- Watch what? Ow!

01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:09.212
- Too late.
- Okay, I think we're close. Whee!

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.551
Hi!

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:13.800
Is this quarantine?

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:15.759
Yes! This is it! We're in quarantine!

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:18.343
My parents are here!

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.675
Where are we going? Hey, what...

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.930
No, why are we going towards the door?

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.305
- We are all better!
- Yay!

01:01:23.389 --> 01:01:25.099
I feel fantastic!

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:27.727
Dude.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:33.147
My family! Come on, let's go! Excuse me.

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:34.402
Dory, wait a minute!

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:41.617
I'm coming Mommy! I'm coming Daddy!

01:01:42.575 --> 01:01:45.615
Whoo-hoo! Almost home.
Almost home. I'm almost home.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.414
I think I'm getting the hang of this! Oh!

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:53.711
I hear footsteps.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.840
- Hank!
- Quiet.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.470
Hank, we need to get in that tank.
That rhymed.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.474
- Why?
- Her parents are there!

01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:03.925
Oh.

01:02:04.013 --> 01:02:07.983
Look, you've got three minutes
to get everyone in this cup with you...

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:09.982
and then I'm on that truck
to Cleveland, got it?

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.024
Got it.

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:16.784
Oh, boy.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:22.948
Mom? Dad?

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:27.445
Mom? Dad? Hey, everybody. It's me, Dory!

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.172
Dory? Dory? Dory?
Jenny and Charlie's Dory? Dory?

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.000
Mom? Dad?

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.344
Mom? Dad?

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.630
Mom? Dad?

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:42.178
- She should just pick 2 and let's go.
- Dad.

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:44.763
What? I'm kidding. It's a reunion.

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:48.677
Mom? Dad? Where are my parents?

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.773
Dory? Are you really
Jenny and Charlie's girl?

01:02:52.895 --> 01:02:55.855
Yes, I am! That's me! Where are they?

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:59.191
Uh, well, Dory, right after
you disappeared, they thought you...

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.700
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.700
- Uh-huh?
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:09.374
And so they came here to look for you.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.206
They're here! Where are they?

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:17.039
Dory, that was years ago.

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:20.051
- Huh?
- They never came back.

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:21.302
Oh, no.

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:25.803
You see, Dory, when fish
don't come back from quarantine...

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:28.138
it means they're not...

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:29.767
What?

01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:32.601
Dory, they're gone.

01:03:32.685 --> 01:03:35.055
They're dead?

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:39.403
-They wanted to find you...
- Wait. Are you sure they're gone?

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:42.364
Dory, listen, it's going to be okay.

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:43.898
Dory, they loved you so much.

01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:46.911
Anyone not looking to go to Cleveland,
final warning!

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:52.448
- Dory, are you all right?
- Are you okay?

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.749
- I was too late.
- Dory, no. No. Now listen.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:59.746
- I don't have a family.
- No, Dory. That's not true.

01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:02.631
Time to go!

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.628
I'm all alone.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.300
- Dory.
- Dory!

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:09.974
Where's everybody else?

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:13.431
Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland. Ah!

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.270
I found the octopus!

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:17.772
Where did he go?

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.743
Mommy? Daddy?

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:36.289
Help.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:42.625
No. No. No. Help. Help. Help me.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:48.136
Help. Help me. Please. Somebody help me!

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.850
Hey, can... Help me?
Can you help me? I've lost them!

01:04:52.014 --> 01:04:55.354
- Oh. Lost who?
- I-I-I-I...

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:58.347
Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.

01:04:58.979 --> 01:05:00.609
Uh...

01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:04.864
Oh! Can you help me? I've lost... them.

01:05:05.027 --> 01:05:06.357
Uh, can you be more specific?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.778
My... My... Them! Them! Them!

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:10.986
Um... Um...

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:13.993
Oh...

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:17.659
Help! Help!

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.786
Please? They're gone!

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:40.981
I've lost... I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:47.355
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting? Something.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.235
Something important. What was it? I...

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:56.373
What was it? It's going away.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:06:01.214
It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:05.495
And I forget.
That's what I do best. That's what I do.

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:11.389
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

01:06:13.387 --> 01:06:15.057
What would Dory do?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.564
I would look around.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.902
And, um, there's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.570
Kelp is better. Okay.

01:06:34.283 --> 01:06:38.873
Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:44.585
It all looks the same,
except there's a rock... over there.

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:50.222
And some sand this way.
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.439
Oh, this isn't going anywhere.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:14.658
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp. Lots of kelp.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:18.953
And some shells... this way.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.617
I like shells.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:28.587
I like... shells.

01:07:54.947 --> 01:07:56.277
Whoa.

01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:35.315
Hello. I'm...

01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:38.735
- Dory!
- Dory! You're here.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.657
- Oh, my baby!
- You're really here.

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:41.866
- Let me look at you.
- You found us.

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.195
- I'm never letting you go again.
- Oh, my missing girl, you're here.

01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:45.369
- My baby!
- It's you.

01:08:45.539 --> 01:08:49.209
- Yes! Oh, absolutely!
- It's really you! Mom, you're here.

01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:52.046
- I am, I...
- And Dad, so are you.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:53.669
Right here, kelpcake.

01:08:57.217 --> 01:08:58.887
I'm so sorry.

01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:01.722
Oh, honey. Oh, honey, no. Kelpcake.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:05.558
I know I've got a problem. I know I'm...
And I'm so sorry.

01:09:05.726 --> 01:09:09.806
And all this time I've wanted to fix it
and I can't and I try. I try.

01:09:09.896 --> 01:09:12.726
But my thoughts... they leave my head
and ideas change.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.029
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:20.243
Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:24.077
- What?
- You found us!

01:09:24.244 --> 01:09:26.004
That's right. You found us.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.957
Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:34.956
Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.

01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:36.258
Exactly!

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:39.925
But I thought you were gone.
How did you...

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.060
We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:46.221
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

01:09:46.391 --> 01:09:48.601
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:52.609
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

01:09:52.773 --> 01:09:55.113
- We thought you might come back.
- We stayed and waited for you.

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:58.275
So every day, we go out and lay out...

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.317
Shells.

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:10.616
And you found us. Oh, honey, you found us.

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:13.291
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:19.756
You remembered
in your own, amazing, Dory way.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.140
I did. All by myself.

01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:30.805
Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:32.647
Oh, my poor little girl.

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:36.483
Oh, I haven't been all by myself...
Marlin and Nemo!

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.779
- Nobody saw where Dory went?
- No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:42.855
Seriously? That's a lot
of eyeballs doing nothing.

01:10:43.115 --> 01:10:44.695
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:46.366
- We're looking...
- Me help you?

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.003
Dad, look! It's Dory.

01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:56.594
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
I knew she'd find a way... What?

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:58.132
Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you?

01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:00.303
I'm sorry.

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:03.342
I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.428
- What?
- All right. Let's get going.

01:11:05.554 --> 01:11:06.724
No!

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.388
And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.434
A whale?

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.637
Good thing I wasn't there to see that.

01:11:11.727 --> 01:11:13.647
Actually Marlin never believes
I even know how to speak whale...

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.692
but you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:17.356
You know, I like this Marlin already.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:19.994
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

01:11:20.152 --> 01:11:22.572
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

01:11:22.738 --> 01:11:24.448
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:25.701
Um, what would Dory do?

01:11:25.866 --> 01:11:28.656
Well, we'll certainly have to thank
Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.373
Wait. Wait I know this place.

01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:35.581
Hello. I'm Sigourney Weaver.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.499
- There!
- Won't you please join us?

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.550
- That's the Marine Life Institute.
- Oh, you were born there.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:42.545
Dory, is that where your friends are?

01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:46.756
Yes! They were stuck in something.
It was going somewhere.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.814
A truck. They're in the truck!

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.890
That means I could...
Never see them again!

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.098
No! No, no, no. What would Dory do?

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:59.231
Uh, I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.567
Please! Please.
All I know is that I miss them. I... I...

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:07.566
I really miss them. I've said that before.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.075
Um...

01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:11.242
Dory?

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:16.079
Mom, Marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're family.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:20.129
And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.923
Do you know what I mean? Or... I don't...
What's another word for fate?

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:26.179
Like destiny. Destiny?

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.969
Destiny!

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.390
- Dory?
- Destiny!

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:33.805
- Morning, Dest...
- Sh. It's Dory. Something's wrong.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:38.942
Ooh. I got her.
She's right outside the institute.

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:41.902
- Destiny?
- We got to jump.

01:12:42.067 --> 01:12:43.647
- Jump?
- No time to argue!

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.277
Destiny!

01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:48.283
Dory! The truck thing
with your friends is leaving!

01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:50.238
No, no. Destiny.

01:12:50.325 --> 01:12:52.575
Oh, no! That's bad! What do we do?

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:56.118
- All right.
- Yes.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.789
- Here we go. One. Two.
- Yes. Yes.

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:00.787
I can't! I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:04.464
Destiny! I've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:06.301
You've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:07.796
I will be your eyes.

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:10.298
You can be my eyes. But the walls!

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:12.508
There are no walls in the ocean!

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:16.269
- No walls?
- It's your destiny, Destiny.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:18.443
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.943
What? No! Destiny, wait!
No, that's a wall! Wall!

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.030
Mom, Dad, this is my pipe pal.
Destiny, say hi.

01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:32.078
Dory! Are these little blue blobs
your parents?

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.538
They look just like you!

01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:36.832
Hello. I'm Bailey. Mrs Dory, Mr Dory.

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:38.367
- Oh, please, call me Jenny.
- Oh, and I'm Charlie.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.380
Okay. Okay. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:41.881
Okay, what truck?

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:46.011
Bailey, status report.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:49.342
Oh, yes, my beautiful gift. Ooh.

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:51.679
Found it! The truck's merging
onto the freeway

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.181
and it's heading south. Ooh.

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:55.636
Let's go. We are stopping that truck.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.808
- This I've got to see.
- Yeah, yeah, me too!

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.940
Oh, boy, this is gonna be good!

01:14:03.023 --> 01:14:05.483
What the... Gerald!
Have you lost your marbles?

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:08.150
- Don't get used to it, Gerald!
- Cheeky joke.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.244
Bailey, I forgot everything. Catch me up.

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:16.368
Yes, ma'am. Ooh.
Your friends are still on the truck.

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:19.076
Ooh. They're headed north
towards the bridge. Ooh.

01:14:19.247 --> 01:14:21.577
Oh, look, there's a bunch of
cute otters over there.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.128
I want one! Ow!

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:27.923
Ow, Bailey!

01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:30.086
Oh! I see the truck. It's over there.

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:31.928
- Okay, what would Dory do?
- I don't see how we can get on it.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:34.103
Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:36.852
Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.

01:14:37.015 --> 01:14:37.965
People stop to look at things.

01:14:38.058 --> 01:14:39.178
Things that they like.
Things that are cute.

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:42.654
Things that are cute! Okay, I got it.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:44.439
- What? What is it?
- Quickly before I forget.

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:47.226
Destiny, when the truck reaches
the bridge you flip me up there.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:47.980
Got it.

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:50.899
You guys, follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.

01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:54.621
Whoa. Dory.
Honey, you're not leaving us again.

01:14:54.783 --> 01:14:56.453
Your mother's right.
You have to stay with us.

01:14:56.618 --> 01:15:00.458
Dory, what happens if...
You know, if you're gone for too long.

01:15:00.622 --> 01:15:03.332
And what if you get confused and that
makes you distracted. And what if...

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:04.748
I lose you again?

01:15:05.627 --> 01:15:07.377
Oh. Yes.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.628
Mom, Dad, it's gonna be okay because...

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.600
I know that even if I forget
I can find you again.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:23.651
Ooh. Okay a little left. Ooh.
Back the other way a bit.

01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:25.942
Ooh. Okay, that's it. Go! Don't do it.

01:15:26.106 --> 01:15:28.266
- Bailey!
- Okay, now! Now! Do it! Do it!

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.610
- Time for your idea.
- Okay. What idea?

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:41.249
Okay. What do I do? What would Dory do?

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:43.751
Come on, cars, cars. I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:46.793
Cars have to stop.
Stop traffic! Cuddle party!

01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:50.381
Look out!

01:15:52.424 --> 01:15:54.014
They're so cute!

01:15:54.134 --> 01:15:57.054
Look at them! There must be one, two...

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.933
- What's going on, Dad?
- I don't know how.

01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:05.981
I don't know in what way, but I think
this has something to do with...

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:12.492
- Dory!
- Water. Water. I need water.

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:13.782
Are you crazy? How'd you get here?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.950
- Dory!
- Oh!

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.833
- I thought we'd never see you again.
- Aw, me too.

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:23.083
But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried
I just couldn't forget you.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.750
I guess I missed the rest of my family
too much, huh?

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:28.585
- We're family?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:31.169
Do you know what that feels like?

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:34.674
Yes, I know what that feels like.

01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:37.175
Aw!

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:40.683
Hey! Hey, come on. Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo!

01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:43.387
- Oh, no. There goes our ride.
- Back in the water. Come on.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:46.516
Dory, the traffic is starting to move.

01:16:47.145 --> 01:16:48.305
Leave it to me. I got this.

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:51.266
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:54.607
Becky! Becky, come back.
We need your help! Becky!

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:57.741
Dory, follow me.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:02.413
No, no, wait. We don't have Dory!
No, no, Becky wait! Stop it.

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:07.367
We need to go back. Becky, back!
Back, Becky! Loo-loo. Ooo-roo-roo.

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:09.707
- Please don't eat us!
- Where's Dory?

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:11.496
- Who are you?
- Jenny?

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:12.838
- Marlin?
- Charlie?

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:13.961
Nemo? Thank you so much.

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:16.837
Thank you for taking care of Dory.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.928
Dory! She's still in the truck.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:22.893
Becky! Fetch Dory! Ooo-roo. Dor-roo.

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:28.561
Okay, kid. I guess this is goodbye.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:29.896
- No!
- What do you mean, "No"?

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:32.523
You're not going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to the ocean with me.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.227
What is it with you and ruining my plans?

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:37.397
Listen to me, I have one goal in life.
One! And it is to...

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:41.200
No, you listen to me. What is so great
about plans? I never had a plan.

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:44.872
Did I plan to lose my parents? No.
Did I plan to find Marlin? No.

01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:47.656
Did you and I plan to meet? Wait. Did we?

01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:49.959
- Are you almost done?
- Well, I don't think we did.

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:52.923
And that's because the best things
happen by chance. Because that's life.

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:57.626
That's you being with me out
in the ocean not safe in some glass box.

01:17:57.799 --> 01:17:58.799
- Can I say something?
- I'm not done!

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:02.095
A friend of mine... Her name's
Sigourney... Once told me that...

01:18:02.262 --> 01:18:03.762
all it takes is three simple steps:

01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:07.310
Rescue, rehabilitation,
and one other thing...

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:09.475
Release!

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.772
That's right! So what do you say?

01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:14.898
Release! Release! Release!

01:18:15.066 --> 01:18:18.356
Release! Release! Release!

01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:21.026
Release! Release! Release!

01:18:21.114 --> 01:18:22.914
I was gonna say, "Okay."

01:18:24.993 --> 01:18:26.333
Not good.

01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:28.621
- Oh, no! They're going away!
- Oh, no! Dory! What do we do?

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.286
Quick! Guys, grab my fin!

01:18:32.417 --> 01:18:36.127
Ooh! He's trying to get the door open.
Ooh. It's locked from the outside.

01:18:36.254 --> 01:18:37.464
Come on, Dory. You can do it.

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.970
Destiny! Destiny! Wall! Wall! Wall!

01:18:41.301 --> 01:18:43.851
- Dory, no! Wait!
- Dory!

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:48.022
- Bailey, where are they headed?
- Ooh. I'm losing them.

01:18:52.437 --> 01:18:54.397
Dory, it's over.

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:57.647
- No, there's got to be a way.
- Yeah. There's a way!

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:00.447
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.

01:19:00.612 --> 01:19:02.952
But... There's got to be a way.
There's always a way.

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:06.831
There isn't, Dory. I'm telling you.
This time there is no other way.

01:19:07.327 --> 01:19:08.367
Well, what about that?

01:19:10.538 --> 01:19:12.328
Holy carp. There is another way.

01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:14.917
Take a deep breath, kid.

01:19:15.043 --> 01:19:17.343
Release! Release! Release!

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:21.133
Release! Release! Release! Release!

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.260
# Your lying eyes... #

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.389
What is that?

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:29.723
I don't care what it is! Get it off!

01:19:30.058 --> 01:19:30.928
What the...

01:19:31.726 --> 01:19:33.186
Suck it, bipeds.

01:19:34.354 --> 01:19:37.614
All right, Hank, you've got seven arms...
I don't know. Just try something.

01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:38.982
Okay. Here we go.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:44.318
- Huh? Hey! Stop. Stop. Wait! No!
- Hey! Hey! Stop. Wait. Oh, no!

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:47.197
- That's doing something.
- And we are moving. Good job, Hank.

01:19:47.325 --> 01:19:52.285
- Wait, wait, wait! Come on! Whoa!
- Hey! What? Hey! Stop! Wait. Wait.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:55.713
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to drive. Certainly I can't do...

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.535
I'm not in any position...
But could you go faster?

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.710
No! No, no! No, no, no!

01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:05.344
- Whoo!
- Hey! Give us our truck back!

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.048
I can't see squat. Which way are we going?

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.140
Okay. Well, all the cars
are going left so go left.

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:14.685
Gilman Street. Ashby Avenue. Powell.

01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:17.309
Gilman Street again. Huh.
Gilman Street again.

01:20:17.397 --> 01:20:19.227
How much longer are we gonna veer left?

01:20:22.902 --> 01:20:24.782
Okay, we just need to know how we got on,

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:26.202
then we'll know how to get off.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.872
Well, let me know when you figure it out.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.580
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.662
Hey, I know those guys!
That's where we came from. Turn right.

01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:33.707
Here we go!

01:20:38.543 --> 01:20:42.923
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait!
- Oh, my... Whoa. Hey!

01:20:43.423 --> 01:20:45.223
We are so fired.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:50.180
Keep straight. Straight. Left.
Left. No, no, no. Right. Right. Right.

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:53.354
- Good driving, Hank.
- Pay attention to the road.

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:55.734
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. Uh-oh.
Fork in the road.

01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:58.232
- Which way?
- Ocean. Ocean. Hey, a boat!

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.194
You know, I haven't had
great experiences with boats, but I...

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.364
- Which way?
- Boats go to the ocean. Right!

01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:04.743
Hold on!

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.534
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:12.787
Um... Okay, I'll figure it out.
I don't know, but...

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:15.119
Well, something will come and...

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:19.671
Seagulls. Hank, follow those birds!
The ocean's left, Hank.

01:21:20.877 --> 01:21:22.707
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

01:21:22.837 --> 01:21:25.967
Ooh. Hold on. Ooh. I'm getting something.

01:21:26.132 --> 01:21:27.472
Is it them? Is everything perfect?

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:31.143
Uh-oh, it's the fuzz. Busted.

01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:38.142
Okay, we're good. The ocean!
It's straight ahead. Floor it!

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:39.271
Now we're talking.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.942
- Oh. Uh-oh!
- What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.526
Oh, no. What would I do?
What would I do? What would I do?

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:49.908
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.

01:21:50.031 --> 01:21:51.701
I'm okay with crazy.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.618
All right, Hank.

01:21:53.743 --> 01:21:57.793
Ooh. There's no way out. It's over.
They're going to fish jail! Ooh!

01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:02.955
Wait. Ooh. Oh, no. Ooh. Get back! Incoming!

01:22:05.505 --> 01:22:08.165
# I see trees of green

01:22:10.635 --> 01:22:13.095
# Red roses too

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:16.269
# I see them bloom for me and you

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:21.595
# And I think to myself #

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:25.899
Whoo-hoo!

01:22:26.526 --> 01:22:27.526
Whoo-hoo!

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:28.902
Whoo-hoo!

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:33.865
Whoo-hoo!

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:38.543
Fish!

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:44.838
Dory!

01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:46.589
What lies before you

01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:48.801
represents the third
and final part of the...

01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:51.179
Marine Life mission.

01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:56.512
Rescue, rehabilitation, and release.

01:22:57.265 --> 01:22:59.055
Come to Papa.

01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:07.899
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:14.703
One, two, three, four...

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:16.664
Uh...

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.662
Wait a minute. Why am I counting?
Hey, where is everyone?

01:23:19.787 --> 01:23:24.037
Uh-oh, did they leave me?
No! No, no. They wouldn't do that.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:27.088
Okay. That's okay. I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:31.263
I was, um, covering my face,
so I was trying to hide.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.594
Okay, so why was I trying to hide? Wait!

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.599
Oh, I... Five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.138
Ready or not, here I come!

01:23:37.263 --> 01:23:38.603
Ha, found you!

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:39.604
- I see you!
- Oh!

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:40.814
Haha! Gotcha!

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.935
All right, you little shrimps,
recess is over.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:45.272
- Aw, man.
- Ah, nobody found me!

01:23:45.438 --> 01:23:47.358
Bring it in. Time for another...

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.980
Don't touch me. Time for another lesson.

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.650
When is Mr Ray coming back
from his migration?

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:53.949
If he's smart he'll stay away from here
as long as he can.

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:55.953
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:58.445
Okay kids, who wants to learn
about echolocation?

01:23:58.618 --> 01:23:59.828
- Boo.
- Nobody.

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.252
Oh, come on, guys.
It's actually really cool.

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:03.963
Okay, kelpcake. Have fun.

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:05.793
Nice day for a swim, huh?

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.788
All right. Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:11.510
Well, I guess we'll go back home
and brush up on the anemone.

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:12.972
You coming, Dory?

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:15.092
Me? Oh, I'm just going to the dropoff.

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:18.755
Oh, okay. What? The dropoff? No!

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:21.016
That's... That's a good idea?

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.230
Yeah. I just thought
I'd go enjoy the view. Bye.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:27.805
The view. Well, you have a good time!

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:32.530
All by yourself. Not getting lost.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.327
Oh!

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:47.627
Huh?

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:56.183
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
No, no, Dory. Dory. Dory! D...

01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:11.358
- Hey, Marlin.
- Oh, hey. Hello, Dory.

01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:12.984
You all right? You look worried.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.490
No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's how I always look.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:22.453
What?

01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:24.115
Well, I just...

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.290
You did it.

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:31.381
- Yay!
- You did it, kelpcake.

01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:34.054
- Yes!
- Did what?

01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:39.343
Sweetie, you just followed the shells
all the way back home.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:42.718
Oh, my gosh! I did? All by myself?

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:45.177
- Yeah.
- Do you know what this means?

01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:50.351
It means you can do
whatever you put your mind to, Dory.

01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:51.561
Really?

01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:55.896
Mommy, can I go play with them?

01:25:56.569 --> 01:26:00.029
- Yes.
- Absolutely! Go get them, kelpcake.

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:07.748
Yeah. I did it.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.421
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.586
It really is quite a view.

01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:25.643
Yep.

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:28.891
Unforgettable.

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:54.998
# Unforgettable

01:26:56.212 --> 01:26:58.762
# That's what you are

01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:05.848
# Unforgettable

01:27:07.306 --> 01:27:11.016
# Tho' near or far

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:18.692
# Like a song of love that clings to me

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:23.657
# How the thought of you does things to me

01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:27.952
# Never before

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:33.455
# Has someone been more...

01:27:34.667 --> 01:27:37.497
# Unforgettable

01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:40.506
# In every way

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.431
# And forever more

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:53.847
# That's how you'll stay

01:27:55.813 --> 01:28:00.993
# That's why, darling, it's incredible

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.700
# That someone so unforgettable

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:09.328
# Thinks that I am

01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:12.200
# Unforgettable, too

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:02.247
# Unforgettable

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:05.045
# In every way

01:29:09.595 --> 01:29:12.845
# And forever more

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:16.268
# That's how you'll stay

01:29:20.147 --> 01:29:25.357
# That's why, darling, it's incredible

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:30.281
# That someone so unforgettable

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:34.827
# Thinks that I am

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:39.461
# Unforgettable, too #

01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:29.312
Off, off, off, off, off,
off, off, off, off, off!

01:35:32.144 --> 01:35:34.444
Come on. Roll, roll. That's it. Hurry!

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:35.811
That's it. Just roll!

01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:36.651
I'm right behind you.

01:35:36.815 --> 01:35:39.355
You can do it! Just a little farther.
That's it!

01:35:39.526 --> 01:35:41.696
I am truly going to vomit!

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:44.992
- Voilà!
- All right, gang, good work.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:48.661
Look, Flo, we made it!

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:51.407
We won't have any more problems
from here on out.

01:35:54.041 --> 01:35:55.331
No respect for ocean life.

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:57.344
Now what?
