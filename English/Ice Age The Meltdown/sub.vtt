00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.240
This global warming is killing me.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.320
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.409
What would it take to make you happy?

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.079
This I like.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.948
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:11.288
No running, James. Camp rules.

00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:15.587
Make me, sloth.

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:19.008
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

00:04:21.098 --> 00:04:22.718
Water ball.

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:25.218
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.

00:04:25.218 --> 00:04:27.728
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't pee-pee there.

00:04:27.808 --> 00:04:30.728
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:32.397
Pi?„ata!

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:35.687
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.697
OK.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.407
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:42.487
- Mine.
- Mine.

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.626
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:53.086
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

00:04:57.916 --> 00:05:01.006
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

00:05:01.086 --> 00:05:03.887
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:07.886
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:10.096
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:16.396
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.

00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:20.356
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:25.116
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:27.445
Don't make me eat you.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.745
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:34.625
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:37.455
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:42.085
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:45.965
I can see that.

00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:50.555
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

00:05:50.635 --> 00:05:56.225
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:01.314
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:04.364
Hey, let's play
pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.904
Yeah!

00:06:06.444 --> 00:06:07.944
Sid!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.034
I can do stuff.

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:14.164
Won't give me their stupid respect.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.333
I'll show 'em.

00:06:20.373 --> 00:06:26.213
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

00:06:26.293 --> 00:06:29.304
And they lived happily ever after.

00:06:32.014 --> 00:06:34.304
- Good job.
- Question.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.853
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

00:06:37.933 --> 00:06:41.813
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

00:06:41.893 --> 00:06:45.273
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

00:06:45.353 --> 00:06:48.983
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:52.993
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:57.782
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

00:06:59.162 --> 00:07:01.872
See, that's why I called it a burro.

00:07:03.332 --> 00:07:06.962
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:09.552
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:12.172
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:14.592
Sometimes I throw up.

00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:19.682
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:23.682
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:26.442
Where's your big, happy family?

00:07:31.231 --> 00:07:35.491
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.

00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:39.951
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:42.581
- I thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:45.961
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:49.130
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.510
Fast Tony - he says
the world's gonna flood.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.300
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.721
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.

00:07:57.721 --> 00:07:58.801
Yeah, right.

00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:01.261
Gather round, gather round.

00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.851
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:06.480
So you can't breathe underwater?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.900
My assistant here will demonstrate.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.440
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.780
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.780
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.990
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.119
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:26.909
Of course, results may vary.

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:31.039
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.959
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:39.549
It's my weather forecast. The five-day
outlook calls for intense flooding

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.219
followed by the end of the world.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.099
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:50.979
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:55.649
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:58.279
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:00.698
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.

00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:03.198
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

00:09:03.278 --> 00:09:06.038
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.

00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:10.458
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

00:09:10.538 --> 00:09:13.838
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:18.007
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:20.927
Your breath smells like ants.

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:28.388
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:31.478
Don't pay any attention to him.

00:09:31.558 --> 00:09:34.568
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

00:09:34.648 --> 00:09:36.607
What about the dinosaurs?

00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:39.027
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:42.407
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:45.537
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

00:09:46.197 --> 00:09:50.867
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.

00:09:52.077 --> 00:09:54.086
One,

00:09:54.786 --> 00:09:55.996
two...

00:09:56.086 --> 00:09:59.546
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.

00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:01.376
Jump! Jump! Jump!

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:03.586
Jump! Jump! Jump!

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:05.176
Sorry.

00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:09.017
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

00:10:09.097 --> 00:10:11.766
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:14.766
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:18.226
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:21.486
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:24.566
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:29.075
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:34.575
Hey, watch it.

00:10:40.415 --> 00:10:45.425
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:04.604
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

00:11:04.694 --> 00:11:09.114
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

00:11:09.194 --> 00:11:11.744
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

00:11:11.824 --> 00:11:13.454
Guys.

00:11:13.534 --> 00:11:15.704
Fast Tony was right.

00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:19.454
Everything is melting.

00:11:44.063 --> 00:11:48.403
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

00:11:48.483 --> 00:11:51.403
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

00:11:51.483 --> 00:11:55.613
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

00:11:56.953 --> 00:12:02.372
This whole thing's a piece ofjunk.
I can't believe I live here.

00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:05.372
What?

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:15.971
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:21.392
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:24.562
All right, it's your funeral.

00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:36.861
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:12:36.951 --> 00:12:40.911
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.

00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:43.751
Go suck air through a reed.

00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:47.211
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.

00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:49.381
I am? I mean, yes, I am.

00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:54.050
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.180
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.180
The entire valley's gonna flood.

00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:06.391
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.

00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:09.560
Look around. You're in a bowl.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.860
BowI's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.900
What are we gonna do?

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.570
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.410
There's a boat. It can save you.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.450
- I don't see anything.
- But

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.869
y'all better hurry.

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:33.459
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:36.549
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:40.969
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:43.049
Boom!

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:46.719
There is some good news, though.

00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:48.849
The more of you die,

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:50.939
the better I eat.

00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:55.729
I didn't say it was good news for you.

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:02.658
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:28.347
Dam.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:33.188
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

00:14:33.268 --> 00:14:35.768
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

00:14:35.858 --> 00:14:39.487
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:42.567
If there's any hope, it's that way.

00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:05.386
Manny, let's go.

00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:29.116
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:31.695
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:35.325
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.

00:15:35.415 --> 00:15:37.375
I call the dark meat.

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:43.585
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:48.005
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:54.094
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

00:16:00.935 --> 00:16:03.605
Do we have to bring this crap?

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:09.024
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

00:16:09.114 --> 00:16:11.154
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

00:16:11.234 --> 00:16:14.034
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:18.034
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

00:16:18.124 --> 00:16:23.624
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

00:16:25.463 --> 00:16:28.713
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

00:16:28.793 --> 00:16:30.043
See?

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:33.763
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

00:17:12.252 --> 00:17:14.632
Stu. Come on, Stu.

00:17:14.712 --> 00:17:17.472
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:20.601
Stu.

00:17:26.102 --> 00:17:31.442
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

00:19:45.157 --> 00:19:47.447
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

00:19:52.537 --> 00:19:54.867
Stop singing, Sid.

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:03.716
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

00:20:03.796 --> 00:20:07.006
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:19.815
What if you're right?

00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:21.896
What if I am the last mammoth?

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:25.276
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:28.736
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

00:20:32.826 --> 00:20:35.455
- Mammoths?
- I knew I couldn't be the last one.

00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:38.035
I felt it in my gut.

00:20:49.545 --> 00:20:51.715
Extinct? Come on.

00:20:55.304 --> 00:20:58.394
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:02.434
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:13.154
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

00:21:15.704 --> 00:21:19.574
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

00:21:21.284 --> 00:21:23.294
Nasty.

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:27.124
Manny.

00:21:28.963 --> 00:21:31.543
I need to be alone for a while.

00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:34.423
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:44.313
One truly is the loneliest number.

00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:50.103
These work great.

00:21:50.903 --> 00:21:52.773
Cool.

00:21:53.903 --> 00:21:57.783
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get 'em.

00:21:58.783 --> 00:22:02.083
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

00:22:02.453 --> 00:22:06.002
- Hey, ugly.
- I gotta sit on that.

00:22:10.672 --> 00:22:12.252
Gotcha.

00:22:18.972 --> 00:22:20.932
OK, I'm going in.

00:22:21.801 --> 00:22:24.141
- Sid.
- What?

00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:26.021
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:28.981
- I felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

00:22:33.902 --> 00:22:36.322
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

00:22:36.862 --> 00:22:38.862
Over here.

00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:42.241
- Surrender?
- Never.

00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:44.031
Cool.

00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:46.201
Smoke them.

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:58.260
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.970
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.550
Miscreants?

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.930
Diego, they're possums.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.350
Retreat.

00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:40.969
I guess it's just you and me now.

00:23:52.938 --> 00:23:55.768
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.

00:23:55.858 --> 00:23:59.979
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:01.649
Wait. What?

00:24:01.739 --> 00:24:04.409
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

00:24:04.489 --> 00:24:08.578
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

00:24:08.658 --> 00:24:12.868
And you were in the tree because...?

00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:16.378
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:18.998
Brothers? You mean there's more?

00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:21.088
Sure.

00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.968
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

00:24:24.798 --> 00:24:28.177
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

00:24:28.257 --> 00:24:31.467
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

00:24:31.557 --> 00:24:33.727
Help! Help!

00:24:33.807 --> 00:24:35.807
Help!

00:24:40.017 --> 00:24:44.357
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

00:24:44.447 --> 00:24:48.157
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

00:24:49.827 --> 00:24:54.577
- What are you looking at me for?
- I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

00:24:54.657 --> 00:24:59.207
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

00:24:59.287 --> 00:25:03.296
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:05.426
And my other friend, the platypus.

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:09.176
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

00:25:09.256 --> 00:25:12.556
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:17.726
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:22.855
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

00:25:24.185 --> 00:25:27.196
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:29.486
Hey, she should come with us.

00:25:29.566 --> 00:25:32.156
Are you insane? No way.

00:25:32.236 --> 00:25:33.786
OK.

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:37.955
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:41.495
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

00:25:41.585 --> 00:25:46.165
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

00:25:46.255 --> 00:25:49.255
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

00:25:49.335 --> 00:25:52.675
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

00:25:52.755 --> 00:25:57.184
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

00:25:58.514 --> 00:26:00.094
Why did you invite them?

00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:03.394
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

00:26:03.474 --> 00:26:04.774
He has a point.

00:26:04.774 --> 00:26:07.774
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?

00:26:07.854 --> 00:26:12.115
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:14.484
If you treat us nicely.

00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:17.154
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.

00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:19.914
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

00:26:19.994 --> 00:26:23.164
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

00:26:23.244 --> 00:26:25.044
Banzai!

00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:27.544
- I got 'em.
- Back! Back!

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:33.503
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:43.013
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.

00:26:43.103 --> 00:26:46.813
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

00:26:46.893 --> 00:26:49.732
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.

00:26:49.812 --> 00:26:53.733
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

00:26:53.823 --> 00:26:57.693
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:00.703
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.

00:27:00.783 --> 00:27:04.993
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.

00:27:05.083 --> 00:27:08.002
- It's poofy.
- OK.

00:27:08.082 --> 00:27:10.252
He's fat.

00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:48.581
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:51.501
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:56.751
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:59.841
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?

00:27:59.921 --> 00:28:01.510
Would I ever.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.350
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:11.480
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:42.839
We'll never make it at this pace.

00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:47.349
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:50.309
OK. Safe? Please.

00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:52.429
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:54.728
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:59.768
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

00:28:59.858 --> 00:29:01.728
- Guys.
- All clear.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:10.029
Hawk!

00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:20.748
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

00:29:21.248 --> 00:29:25.168
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

00:29:25.258 --> 00:29:27.638
But you'd do it for treats, right?

00:29:28.508 --> 00:29:30.757
Is he gone?

00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:35.137
You're safe. Get up.

00:29:36.187 --> 00:29:37.307
Man.

00:29:37.397 --> 00:29:41.857
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:44.607
That's how cousin Wilton went.

00:29:47.736 --> 00:29:50.027
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

00:29:50.117 --> 00:29:54.407
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

00:29:54.497 --> 00:29:58.957
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

00:29:59.037 --> 00:30:02.047
That's right. Don't give up hope.

00:30:03.547 --> 00:30:05.586
Ellie.

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:08.506
Look at our footprints.

00:30:08.586 --> 00:30:10.846
They're the same shape.

00:30:11.386 --> 00:30:14.056
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

00:30:14.136 --> 00:30:16.176
Well, then,

00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:18.556
look at our shadows.

00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:20.936
We match.

00:30:21.016 --> 00:30:23.725
You're right. They're the same.

00:30:23.815 --> 00:30:25.985
You must be part possum.

00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:31.155
You wish.

00:30:44.245 --> 00:30:47.465
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:50.545
We gotta catch up with the others.

00:30:58.844 --> 00:31:01.184
Hey. Knock it off.

00:31:03.684 --> 00:31:07.524
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

00:31:07.604 --> 00:31:10.774
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

00:31:10.854 --> 00:31:13.024
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

00:31:13.114 --> 00:31:18.994
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

00:31:41.343 --> 00:31:43.303
Mammal overboard!

00:31:57.612 --> 00:32:01.363
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.

00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:03.493
Look at me.

00:32:10.002 --> 00:32:12.042
Diego.

00:32:20.052 --> 00:32:21.422
Diego.

00:32:30.981 --> 00:32:33.191
Come on, Diego. Come on.

00:32:34.771 --> 00:32:37.481
This may sting a little.

00:33:42.129 --> 00:33:45.339
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- I don't know.

00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:49.299
From now on,
land - safe, water - not safe.

00:33:55.309 --> 00:33:58.268
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

00:33:58.348 --> 00:34:01.268
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

00:34:01.358 --> 00:34:03.398
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

00:34:03.478 --> 00:34:06.448
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

00:34:06.528 --> 00:34:09.948
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

00:34:10.028 --> 00:34:13.039
Maybe you should run away more.

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:15.408
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

00:34:15.498 --> 00:34:17.498
Happy to help.

00:34:18.368 --> 00:34:22.918
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".

00:34:22.998 --> 00:34:26.088
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:28.428
You like her.

00:34:28.508 --> 00:34:33.057
- I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:35.807
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

00:34:35.887 --> 00:34:38.637
You know, the one where you can't swim.

00:34:38.727 --> 00:34:40.057
That's ridiculous.

00:34:40.057 --> 00:34:42.517
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.

00:34:42.607 --> 00:34:47.107
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:48.585
Almost there.

00:35:49.465 --> 00:35:51.835
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

00:35:51.925 --> 00:35:53.925
Let's roll.

00:35:56.305 --> 00:35:58.465
Wait for me.

00:36:09.184 --> 00:36:12.984
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

00:36:13.064 --> 00:36:15.984
So you think she's the girl for me?

00:36:16.074 --> 00:36:19.243
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

00:36:19.323 --> 00:36:21.953
She completes you.

00:36:24.124 --> 00:36:25.664
Yeah.

00:36:25.744 --> 00:36:30.004
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

00:36:30.084 --> 00:36:32.424
- No.
- Come on.

00:36:32.834 --> 00:36:35.134
You expect to impress
with that attitude?

00:36:35.134 --> 00:36:36.634
I don't want to impress.

00:36:36.714 --> 00:36:39.593
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

00:36:39.673 --> 00:36:43.343
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:47.813
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.

00:36:47.893 --> 00:36:50.563
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

00:36:50.643 --> 00:36:53.023
He's never gonna let up on you.

00:36:53.023 --> 00:36:56.652
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.

00:36:58.272 --> 00:37:00.652
So what do you want me to do?

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:03.112
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.

00:37:03.202 --> 00:37:04.822
I don't know.

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:07.743
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.

00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:10.543
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.

00:37:10.623 --> 00:37:12.582
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

00:37:12.662 --> 00:37:16.382
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

00:37:16.832 --> 00:37:19.002
Farther, farther, farther.

00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:22.012
Perfect. Fire!

00:37:24.182 --> 00:37:26.552
Yeah! I can fly!

00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:40.271
Crash!

00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:44.701
Crash! Crash!

00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:47.371
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

00:37:47.451 --> 00:37:50.411
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:53.831
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:57.291
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

00:37:57.381 --> 00:37:59.541
Can I help in any way here?

00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:02.591
You've done enough.

00:38:03.131 --> 00:38:07.510
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.970
Who's gonna watch my back?

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.640
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.980
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.020
Dung patch?

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.859
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:28.659
- I can run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.739
Hallelujah!

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.999
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

00:38:42.089 --> 00:38:45.339
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

00:38:45.419 --> 00:38:47.589
Not the face.

00:38:58.309 --> 00:39:00.648
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

00:39:00.728 --> 00:39:02.898
She's not half bad.

00:39:04.148 --> 00:39:07.648
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

00:39:07.738 --> 00:39:09.738
So?

00:39:11.278 --> 00:39:13.788
So what's holding you back?

00:39:16.118 --> 00:39:18.118
My family.

00:39:21.668 --> 00:39:24.248
You can have that again, you know.

00:39:24.338 --> 00:39:26.508
No, Sid, I can't.

00:39:27.838 --> 00:39:31.338
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

00:39:31.428 --> 00:39:36.467
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

00:39:43.057 --> 00:39:46.477
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.

00:39:47.607 --> 00:39:50.697
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:58.616
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

00:39:58.706 --> 00:40:01.417
- You're stuck.
- I am not.

00:40:01.497 --> 00:40:04.167
All right, then, let's go.

00:40:05.797 --> 00:40:07.507
I can't.

00:40:08.167 --> 00:40:09.797
I'm stuck.

00:40:09.877 --> 00:40:14.506
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?

00:40:31.105 --> 00:40:32.735
Ellie?

00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:57.635
I know this place.

00:43:01.501 --> 00:43:05.511
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.

00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:12.220
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.810
OK, a lot bigger.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.610
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:26.610
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.029
- you know.
- What?

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:35.329
Attractive.

00:43:35.409 --> 00:43:38.499
- Really?
- Sure.

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:41.830
What about me is attractive?

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.959
I don't know.

00:43:46.049 --> 00:43:48.299
Well, there's your

00:43:49.719 --> 00:43:51.839
butt.

00:43:52.599 --> 00:43:55.009
What about it?

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:57.229
It's

00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:59.559
big.

00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:01.769
You're just saying that.

00:44:02.359 --> 00:44:05.318
No, no, no, I mean it.

00:44:05.398 --> 00:44:09.648
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

00:44:09.738 --> 00:44:12.698
That is really sweet.

00:44:12.778 --> 00:44:15.028
What a crazy day.

00:44:15.118 --> 00:44:20.457
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

00:46:06.765 --> 00:46:09.474
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

00:46:09.564 --> 00:46:11.894
Sure did.

00:46:11.984 --> 00:46:16.774
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

00:46:16.854 --> 00:46:20.324
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

00:46:20.404 --> 00:46:23.614
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.

00:46:23.704 --> 00:46:28.243
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

00:46:28.323 --> 00:46:30.833
Rocks have no fear.

00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:34.413
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

00:46:34.503 --> 00:46:39.384
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

00:46:39.464 --> 00:46:41.254
No. You?

00:46:41.344 --> 00:46:43.883
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

00:46:43.973 --> 00:46:49.643
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

00:46:49.723 --> 00:46:52.473
- I wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

00:46:52.563 --> 00:46:55.523
But the point is that fear is natural.

00:46:56.563 --> 00:46:59.193
Fear is for prey.

00:46:59.273 --> 00:47:02.982
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

00:47:03.072 --> 00:47:06.992
Justjump in and trust your instincts.

00:47:07.072 --> 00:47:09.782
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.

00:47:09.872 --> 00:47:15.872
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

00:47:16.582 --> 00:47:21.042
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

00:47:21.132 --> 00:47:24.132
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

00:47:24.212 --> 00:47:27.132
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

00:47:27.222 --> 00:47:29.552
And I'm breathing.

00:47:29.642 --> 00:47:33.062
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...

00:47:34.472 --> 00:47:38.851
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

00:47:38.941 --> 00:47:41.441
Kind of like a rock.

00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:49.031
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

00:47:49.111 --> 00:47:52.201
Or do we just throw our weight around?

00:47:52.281 --> 00:47:54.041
Whoops. Sorry.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.700
I don't know my own strength yet.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:01.170
Ellie, do you realise that now
we have a chance to save our species?

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:05.921
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:07.881
Did you just...?

00:48:07.971 --> 00:48:11.801
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:15.600
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.310
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:19.690
What?

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.560
All right, that came out wrong. I...

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.730
You're very pretty, but we just met...

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.190
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.279
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:38.119
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

00:48:48.089 --> 00:48:51.969
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

00:48:57.179 --> 00:48:59.849
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:02.559
now you're coming with us at night.

00:49:02.649 --> 00:49:04.809
But we can't see at night.

00:49:04.899 --> 00:49:07.108
Then enjoy the flood.

00:49:07.188 --> 00:49:09.898
I can't even look at him.

00:49:09.988 --> 00:49:11.988
Pervert.

00:49:16.738 --> 00:49:21.748
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

00:49:45.807 --> 00:49:49.067
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

00:49:50.857 --> 00:49:53.397
I thought we could walk together.

00:49:53.487 --> 00:49:56.117
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

00:49:56.197 --> 00:49:59.486
She said she thinks you're ajerk
and to go away.

00:49:59.576 --> 00:50:01.576
She didn't say...

00:50:02.496 --> 00:50:05.496
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

00:50:05.576 --> 00:50:09.586
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

00:50:09.666 --> 00:50:14.587
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

00:50:14.677 --> 00:50:17.676
- I can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

00:50:29.396 --> 00:50:31.606
Stop moving.

00:50:34.855 --> 00:50:36.775
Thank you.

00:50:44.495 --> 00:50:46.575
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

00:50:49.415 --> 00:50:51.495
Now!

00:50:55.924 --> 00:50:59.465
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

00:51:04.845 --> 00:51:08.395
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

00:51:08.475 --> 00:51:10.514
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

00:51:10.604 --> 00:51:12.934
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

00:51:17.354 --> 00:51:21.074
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.

00:51:21.154 --> 00:51:23.694
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

00:51:24.994 --> 00:51:27.414
That it offended her!

00:51:27.494 --> 00:51:30.333
I mean that, that it offended you.

00:51:34.203 --> 00:51:36.873
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

00:51:36.963 --> 00:51:39.833
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:42.214
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

00:51:42.304 --> 00:51:45.174
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

00:51:45.264 --> 00:51:48.053
- Apologise.
- Why me? She overreacted.

00:51:48.133 --> 00:51:50.393
- Just apologise.
- No.

00:51:50.473 --> 00:51:53.393
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

00:51:53.473 --> 00:51:54.933
What?

00:51:55.023 --> 00:51:57.523
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

00:51:57.603 --> 00:52:02.193
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

00:52:02.943 --> 00:52:05.492
I got it. I got it.

00:52:05.572 --> 00:52:07.572
I got it.

00:52:13.492 --> 00:52:15.752
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

00:52:28.552 --> 00:52:32.102
I guess we finally
did something right together.

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:37.232
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.330
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.920
You know. Yesterday, last week.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.471
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

00:53:09.551 --> 00:53:12.091
Yep. Those were the good days.

00:53:12.181 --> 00:53:16.640
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.180
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:24.270
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

00:54:38.928 --> 00:54:41.348
Wait a minute.

00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:43.938
Can I help you?

00:54:54.567 --> 00:54:57.567
Now, that's what I call respect.

00:54:59.777 --> 00:55:01.157
Nice.

00:55:07.166 --> 00:55:10.336
Somebody here likes Sid.

00:55:10.876 --> 00:55:14.876
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

00:55:19.926 --> 00:55:22.556
Fire King.

00:55:28.516 --> 00:55:34.396
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognised my true potential.

00:55:34.486 --> 00:55:36.646
Let there be fire.

00:56:46.343 --> 00:56:49.183
If only the guys could see me now.

00:56:50.803 --> 00:56:54.103
This is either really good
or really bad.

00:56:56.103 --> 00:56:57.273
No, no, no.

00:56:57.353 --> 00:56:59.893
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?

00:56:59.893 --> 00:57:03.313
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.

00:57:03.403 --> 00:57:06.443
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

00:57:06.533 --> 00:57:08.862
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.

00:57:08.952 --> 00:57:13.032
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

00:57:13.122 --> 00:57:15.742
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:18.792
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

00:57:19.622 --> 00:57:21.622
No! No!

00:57:37.722 --> 00:57:40.062
Bad juju!

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.790
Water? Water!

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.260
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.141
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.

00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:18.640
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.020
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.310
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:26.730
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:30.530
Hi. Hey, Manny.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.570
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.119
You were sleepwalking.

00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:39.789
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.

00:58:39.869 --> 00:58:43.159
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

00:58:43.249 --> 00:58:47.459
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

00:58:47.539 --> 00:58:51.549
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.

00:58:51.629 --> 00:58:56.798
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.

00:58:56.888 --> 00:58:58.889
Fine.

00:59:05.689 --> 00:59:09.609
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.

00:59:13.698 --> 00:59:16.158
It was just a figure of speech.

00:59:21.158 --> 00:59:24.998
They just sit there, watching us.

00:59:25.078 --> 00:59:27.918
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

01:01:01.134 --> 01:01:04.004
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

01:01:09.554 --> 01:01:12.435
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:28.534
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

01:01:54.643 --> 01:01:58.933
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

01:02:05.523 --> 01:02:09.403
I just did something
involuntary and messy.

01:02:10.452 --> 01:02:12.452
OK, come on.

01:02:13.492 --> 01:02:16.162
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.

01:02:16.242 --> 01:02:19.202
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.

01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:23.252
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

01:02:23.332 --> 01:02:26.632
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

01:02:26.712 --> 01:02:29.381
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:31.931
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.

01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:33.931
- We go forward.
- We go back.

01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:36.511
- Forward.
- Back.

01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:38.852
- Can I say something?
- No.

01:02:38.932 --> 01:02:43.812
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

01:02:43.902 --> 01:02:45.901
I am a mammoth.

01:02:47.441 --> 01:02:50.691
- Come on.
- Fine.

01:02:50.781 --> 01:02:54.161
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:57.831
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.590
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.420
Manny.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.159
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

01:03:39.239 --> 01:03:41.579
I just heard you're going extinct.

01:03:41.659 --> 01:03:45.289
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're ajerk.

01:03:45.369 --> 01:03:48.129
Where's your big, happy family?

01:03:48.209 --> 01:03:50.799
What's wrong with you?

01:03:50.879 --> 01:03:53.299
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

01:04:00.558 --> 01:04:02.058
That way.

01:04:41.717 --> 01:04:47.727
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

01:04:51.897 --> 01:04:53.897
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.107
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

01:04:56.187 --> 01:04:59.317
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

01:05:00.987 --> 01:05:04.367
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

01:05:04.447 --> 01:05:06.537
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

01:05:06.617 --> 01:05:08.866
Not me.

01:05:08.956 --> 01:05:11.126
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

01:06:10.684 --> 01:06:15.564
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

01:06:28.534 --> 01:06:30.534
Hurry, this way. Come on.

01:06:32.824 --> 01:06:36.494
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

01:06:45.133 --> 01:06:47.803
Come on, come on, run!

01:06:53.893 --> 01:06:55.892
Push.

01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:02.023
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:04.563
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

01:07:07.113 --> 01:07:09.823
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.

01:07:09.903 --> 01:07:11.743
Stay here.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:30.172
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

01:07:30.262 --> 01:07:32.341
Manny.

01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:34.721
Manny.

01:07:38.431 --> 01:07:41.601
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

01:08:42.039 --> 01:08:43.699
Ellie.

01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:45.789
Manny.

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:52.339
- Help!
- I'll save you.

01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:59.049
Great. Who's gonna save him?

01:09:01.678 --> 01:09:03.808
You really need to brush.

01:09:09.058 --> 01:09:12.689
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:16.489
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:20.488
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

01:09:20.568 --> 01:09:22.948
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:25.158
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.

01:09:25.238 --> 01:09:27.658
I am not your prey.

01:09:50.727 --> 01:09:53.226
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

01:09:53.306 --> 01:09:56.857
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.

01:09:56.937 --> 01:10:00.947
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:04.157
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:12.036
Eddie.

01:10:25.716 --> 01:10:29.675
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.

01:10:29.765 --> 01:10:33.185
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.

01:10:33.265 --> 01:10:36.515
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.

01:10:51.785 --> 01:10:54.745
There he is.

01:10:54.825 --> 01:10:57.245
Ellie, hold on to me.

01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:31.574
Manny, Manny, behind you.

01:12:08.563 --> 01:12:10.573
There they are.

01:12:11.653 --> 01:12:13.743
They made it.

01:12:24.252 --> 01:12:27.292
We thought we'd never see you again.

01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:38.801
We're gonna live.

01:12:42.431 --> 01:12:45.351
We're gonna die.

01:14:39.127 --> 01:14:40.877
Well, I'm not leaving.

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:43.927
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.

01:14:44.007 --> 01:14:48.977
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

01:14:49.057 --> 01:14:53.147
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:55.517
Well, I am anyway.

01:14:58.066 --> 01:15:00.987
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.

01:15:01.067 --> 01:15:03.527
Sid's Squids.

01:15:08.447 --> 01:15:11.617
All hail Fire King.

01:15:16.836 --> 01:15:18.626
Hi.

01:15:22.676 --> 01:15:28.346
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

01:15:31.635 --> 01:15:35.805
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:41.485
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

01:15:41.985 --> 01:15:48.236
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

01:15:49.366 --> 01:15:55.205
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:58.915
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

01:15:58.995 --> 01:16:01.915
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

01:16:07.544 --> 01:16:09.674
Don't ask.

01:17:10.022 --> 01:17:13.113
We're not the last ones anymore.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.032
You're not coming?

01:17:20.122 --> 01:17:22.372
You wanna go with them?

01:17:22.452 --> 01:17:24.622
I am a mammoth.

01:17:24.702 --> 01:17:27.332
I should probably be with a mammoth.

01:17:27.422 --> 01:17:29.922
Don't you think?

01:17:30.002 --> 01:17:32.002
Yeah, unless...

01:17:33.802 --> 01:17:35.802
Unless?

01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:39.681
Unless I...

01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:44.971
I just wanna say...

01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:48.231
I need to tell you...

01:17:50.021 --> 01:17:53.941
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

01:17:57.321 --> 01:17:59.321
You too.

01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:39.530
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,

01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:44.620
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

01:18:48.659 --> 01:18:51.619
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

01:18:52.539 --> 01:18:54.789
We'll always be here for you.

01:18:55.499 --> 01:18:59.339
- I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

01:18:59.419 --> 01:19:02.089
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

01:19:08.308 --> 01:19:11.348
Our Manny's growing up.

01:19:11.938 --> 01:19:14.858
Ellie! Ellie!

01:19:19.148 --> 01:19:21.148
Manny.

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:26.698
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.

01:19:26.778 --> 01:19:29.408
I want us to be together
because we want to.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.658
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:38.128
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

01:19:42.127 --> 01:19:44.547
You're possum enough for me.

01:19:58.777 --> 01:20:04.656
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.407
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

01:20:07.487 --> 01:20:12.207
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

01:20:12.287 --> 01:20:14.787
I'll carry him.

01:20:16.327 --> 01:20:19.246
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

01:20:19.336 --> 01:20:20.796
Shotgun!

01:20:23.046 --> 01:20:25.756
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?

01:20:25.836 --> 01:20:29.136
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

01:20:29.216 --> 01:20:32.136
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.

01:20:32.226 --> 01:20:35.265
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

01:20:35.345 --> 01:20:37.975
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...

01:20:37.975 --> 01:20:40.605
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.

01:20:40.685 --> 01:20:43.275
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No.

01:20:43.355 --> 01:20:46.275
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

01:20:46.355 --> 01:20:49.865
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.

01:23:09.121 --> 01:23:11.461
I saved you, little buddy.

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:27.890
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
