If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

00:38:55.526 --> 00:38:58.403
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

to build this team

of people you can't even find.

00:39:26.098 --> 00:39:28.225
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

00:39:28.308 --> 00:39:30.352
Just because Lex Luthor says

00:39:30.435 --> 00:39:32.312
the planet's
in danger of attack?

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:34.606
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

00:39:34.731 --> 00:39:36.066
It has to do with him.

00:39:36.149 --> 00:39:40.195
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

00:39:40.279 --> 00:39:43.407
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

I need to bring us together
and make this right.

Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.251
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

00:39:54.376 --> 00:39:57.880
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

00:39:57.963 --> 00:39:59.631
Maybe they're already here.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.429
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

01:31:40.354 --> 01:31:43.440
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:45.150
[paper rustles]

01:31:45.234 --> 01:31:47.236
Tell me about this.

01:31:51.198 --> 01:31:53.992
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

01:31:54.076 --> 01:31:57.037
but who is definitely not me.

01:31:57.955 --> 01:31:59.832
Somebody... I don't know.

01:31:59.957 --> 01:32:01.834
Hippie, long hair.

01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:04.753
Very attractive Jewish boy.

01:32:06.255 --> 01:32:08.924
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

01:32:09.049 --> 01:32:10.509
I know you have abilities.

01:32:10.551 --> 01:32:12.845
I just don't know
what they are.

01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:14.013
My special skills

01:32:14.096 --> 01:32:16.765
include viola, web design,

01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:19.727
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

01:32:19.852 --> 01:32:23.564
[Bruce] Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

01:32:23.647 --> 01:32:25.899
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

01:32:26.066 --> 01:32:27.943
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

01:32:28.068 --> 01:32:29.695
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.530
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

01:32:31.655 --> 01:32:34.408
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:37.536
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

01:32:37.619 --> 01:32:39.913
but whoever
you're looking for,

01:32:39.997 --> 01:32:41.165
it's not me.

01:32:46.795 --> 01:32:48.255
[electricity crackles]

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.497
[exhales sharply]

01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:24.750
You're the Batman?

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:27.628
So, you're fast.

01:33:27.711 --> 01:33:29.379
That feels
like an oversimplification.

01:33:29.505 --> 01:33:31.298
I'm putting together a team.

01:33:31.423 --> 01:33:33.467
People with special abilities.

01:33:33.634 --> 01:33:35.260
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

01:33:35.302 --> 01:33:37.554
Stop right there. I'm in.

01:33:38.639 --> 01:33:39.932
You are?

01:33:40.015 --> 01:33:41.099
Just like that?

01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:42.476
Yeah. [hesitates]

01:33:44.269 --> 01:33:46.814
I need friends.

01:33:46.939 --> 01:33:50.192
Great. Great.

01:33:50.317 --> 01:33:52.528
Can I keep this?

01:33:52.653 --> 01:33:54.488
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

01:33:54.571 --> 01:33:56.281
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

01:33:56.406 --> 01:33:57.825
I call it the Speed Force.

01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:59.660
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

01:33:59.743 --> 01:34:02.621
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

01:34:02.746 --> 01:34:05.207
I am a snack hole.

01:34:05.332 --> 01:34:08.210
How many people are
on this special fight team?

01:34:08.335 --> 01:34:10.295
-Three, including you.
-Three?

01:34:10.379 --> 01:34:13.132
Against what?

01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:14.758
I'll tell you on the plane.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.094
Plane?

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:18.971
What are your
superpowers again?

01:34:19.096 --> 01:34:20.848
I'm rich.

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:24.852
[engine starts]

01:34:31.233 --> 01:34:32.985
[tires screeching]

01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:34.987
[car horn blares]

01:34:35.112 --> 01:34:37.156
[kettle whistles]

01:34:41.702 --> 01:34:43.662
[whistling stops]

01:34:43.704 --> 01:34:45.664
Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.

01:34:45.747 --> 01:34:48.709
[Diana] No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

01:34:48.876 --> 01:34:50.669
[sniffs] Would you like
to have some?

01:34:50.794 --> 01:34:52.212
Uh, no, thank you.

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.841
If you put the water in first.

01:34:55.883 --> 01:34:59.303
-[Diana] Of course.
-So we don't scald the tea.

01:35:02.097 --> 01:35:03.515
-Yes.
-Great.

01:35:03.599 --> 01:35:05.851
No, that's probably
enough tea.

01:35:05.934 --> 01:35:08.228
[Diana] All right.

01:35:08.353 --> 01:35:09.730
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

01:35:09.897 --> 01:35:13.942
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

01:35:14.067 --> 01:35:17.070
I will.
I will, definitely will.

01:35:17.154 --> 01:35:19.364
Uh... What are you working on?

01:35:19.448 --> 01:35:21.283
It's a gauntlet

01:35:21.408 --> 01:35:25.204
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

01:35:25.287 --> 01:35:27.706
-Wow.
-Here, let me show you.

01:35:27.748 --> 01:35:30.959
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

01:35:31.084 --> 01:35:32.377
[Alfred chuckles]

01:35:32.461 --> 01:35:33.879
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

01:35:33.962 --> 01:35:35.589
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

01:35:35.672 --> 01:35:36.715
Of course.

01:35:39.509 --> 01:35:41.762
[buzzing and crackling]

01:35:41.887 --> 01:35:43.472
[Alfred] Ah.

01:35:43.597 --> 01:35:46.600
Ah, now,
let's see how that did.

01:35:46.683 --> 01:35:49.102
-[device beeps]
-Ha! Yes.

01:35:49.227 --> 01:35:50.771
Not to be sneezed at.

01:35:50.854 --> 01:35:53.398
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

01:35:53.482 --> 01:35:55.275
It's Master Wayne's idea.

01:35:55.359 --> 01:35:57.611
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

01:35:57.694 --> 01:36:00.572
-In black, of course.
-Oh.

01:36:04.701 --> 01:36:06.286
[sighs]

01:36:07.329 --> 01:36:10.499
-All right. Victor Stone.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.343
[static]

01:36:26.556 --> 01:36:29.017
Something is not working.

01:36:29.142 --> 01:36:30.811
[Alfred] Mmm.

01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:36.858
[system warbling]

01:36:40.404 --> 01:36:42.864
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:03.802
[car door closes]

01:37:20.402 --> 01:37:22.070
[electricity crackles]

01:37:39.755 --> 01:37:43.091
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

01:37:43.216 --> 01:37:44.509
You know who I am.

01:37:44.593 --> 01:37:46.845
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

01:37:46.928 --> 01:37:50.182
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

01:37:50.307 --> 01:37:51.516
The world does.

01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:54.561
Fuck the world.

01:37:55.937 --> 01:37:58.565
[Diana] You've obviously
been through a great deal.

01:37:59.608 --> 01:38:02.694
I can't begin to imagine what.

01:38:02.736 --> 01:38:06.365
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

01:38:06.448 --> 01:38:08.283
Gifts?

01:38:08.408 --> 01:38:10.577
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:12.412
We need you, Victor.

01:38:12.537 --> 01:38:14.247
And maybe you need us.

01:38:14.331 --> 01:38:16.041
I don't need anyone.

01:38:18.251 --> 01:38:19.419
Not anymore.

01:38:19.503 --> 01:38:21.963
I told myself the same
for a long time.

01:38:28.637 --> 01:38:31.598
I lost someone I loved once.

01:38:34.351 --> 01:38:39.106
I shut myself off
from everyone.

01:38:40.690 --> 01:38:43.610
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

01:38:46.029 --> 01:38:49.616
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

01:38:49.699 --> 01:38:53.662
And if you asked to meet me...

01:38:53.787 --> 01:38:56.706
you're working on it, too.

01:39:34.536 --> 01:39:36.788
[grunting]

01:40:08.111 --> 01:40:10.322
You were right
about the metal sample

01:40:10.363 --> 01:40:11.907
from the Superman ship.

01:40:12.032 --> 01:40:15.494
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

01:40:15.619 --> 01:40:17.204
look what happens.

01:40:18.205 --> 01:40:19.664

3.5 million kelvin.

01:40:28.048 --> 01:40:31.301
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

01:40:31.426 --> 01:40:33.845
Hot, dense matter.

01:40:36.932 --> 01:40:39.768
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

01:40:39.893 --> 01:40:42.229
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

01:40:42.312 --> 01:40:43.939
She dumped me anyway.

01:40:44.064 --> 01:40:45.190
Yeah.

01:40:47.567 --> 01:40:49.277
[laser shuts down]

01:40:49.402 --> 01:40:50.528
Hey, Doc,

01:40:50.612 --> 01:40:52.197
do you think
Batman is connected

01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:55.033
to the object
the CID is looking for?

01:40:55.951 --> 01:40:59.204
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

01:41:00.372 --> 01:41:01.581
No...

01:41:02.415 --> 01:41:03.750
I don't.

01:41:38.493 --> 01:41:40.704
Oh, Victor.

01:42:02.309 --> 01:42:03.351
[officer] Come on!

Your messages.

01:42:04.769 --> 01:42:06.229

Half of Gotham's
reality-challenged
community showed up.

01:42:14.821 --> 01:42:16.990
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

-Looks like...
-I know what it looks like,
Crispus.

01:42:39.679 --> 01:42:42.265
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:45.268
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

01:42:46.353 --> 01:42:47.437
I'll talk to him tonight.

01:42:47.562 --> 01:42:49.147
How, Jim?

01:42:49.272 --> 01:42:50.857

His name is Victor.

We met, spoke.

You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

That's not right. Great.

Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

Oh, sorry.
[softly] That's your signal.

01:43:43.034 --> 01:43:44.494
That means we have to go now.

the perimeter guards
were taken.

He won't send reinforcements.

He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel. [sighs]

01:44:58.151 --> 01:44:59.819

we have left

01:48:16.683 --> 01:48:18.476
[portal booms]

01:48:48.756 --> 01:48:51.092
[Mera] Vulko told me
you would come.

01:48:51.217 --> 01:48:54.137
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

01:48:56.723 --> 01:48:58.057
Wait.

01:48:59.934 --> 01:49:01.144
Please.

01:49:04.689 --> 01:49:06.107
I knew her.

01:49:08.151 --> 01:49:10.445
Well, that makes one of us.

01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:12.405
My parents died in the wars.

01:49:14.115 --> 01:49:15.700
She took me in.

01:49:15.783 --> 01:49:17.452
What a saint.

01:49:17.577 --> 01:49:19.704
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:22.540
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

01:49:22.623 --> 01:49:24.375
and never gave me
another thought.

01:49:24.417 --> 01:49:27.628
Your mother left you
to save your life.

01:49:27.754 --> 01:49:30.465
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

01:49:31.924 --> 01:49:34.135
What it cost her.

01:49:35.178 --> 01:49:37.513
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

01:49:39.682 --> 01:49:41.392
It would have been
her responsibility

01:49:41.434 --> 01:49:44.771
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

01:49:45.438 --> 01:49:46.522
Now,

01:49:47.815 --> 01:49:49.233
it's yours.

01:49:54.906 --> 01:49:56.532
[scoffs]

01:50:13.174 --> 01:50:15.259

Yes.

[Mother Boxes warbling]

01:51:17.905 --> 01:51:19.156
[DeSaad]<i> Steppenwolf,</i>

01:51:19.282 --> 01:51:21.242
tell me what you've learned.

01:51:21.367 --> 01:51:23.870
[Steppenwolf] Two boxes
found and awake.

01:51:24.036 --> 01:51:27.039
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

01:51:27.123 --> 01:51:30.376
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

01:51:30.459 --> 01:51:33.004
Where is the third Mother Box?

01:51:33.087 --> 01:51:35.506
The parademons
sense its presence

01:51:35.548 --> 01:51:37.258
and search for the third.

01:51:37.383 --> 01:51:38.384
They have taken prisoners

01:51:38.509 --> 01:51:40.720
who carry its scent.

01:51:41.554 --> 01:51:43.181
Go.

01:51:43.264 --> 01:51:45.391
Interrogate the prisoners.

01:51:46.058 --> 01:51:47.894
Find the third.

01:51:49.395 --> 01:51:51.689
They will tell me
what they know,

01:51:52.732 --> 01:51:55.484
or I will rip it from them.

01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:08.289
[thunder crashes]

01:52:23.804 --> 01:52:24.847

01:52:34.565 --> 01:52:36.609
[electricity crackles]

01:52:38.611 --> 01:52:40.404
How many of you are there?

01:52:41.155 --> 01:52:42.406
Not enough.

01:52:44.116 --> 01:52:46.535
[Gordon] Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

01:52:46.661 --> 01:52:48.037
Description
matches the suspect

01:52:48.162 --> 01:52:49.956
in the Metropolis abductions.

01:52:50.081 --> 01:52:51.249
Parademons.

01:52:51.791 --> 01:52:53.125
Okay.

01:52:53.292 --> 01:52:55.503
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

01:52:55.628 --> 01:52:57.004
[The Flash] At the lab.

01:52:57.129 --> 01:52:59.257
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.424
So the eight
may still be alive.

01:53:00.466 --> 01:53:01.467
[Victor] Nine.

01:53:01.592 --> 01:53:03.469
[The Flash gasps] Oh.

01:53:03.552 --> 01:53:06.305
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:13.980
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

01:53:14.105 --> 01:53:15.356
So, how do we find him?

01:53:15.481 --> 01:53:17.024
There must be a nest nearby.

01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:21.445
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

01:53:21.529 --> 01:53:23.656
No discernable pattern
I can see.

01:53:23.781 --> 01:53:25.241
The lines on the map
don't converge.

01:53:25.366 --> 01:53:26.659
On land.

01:53:26.784 --> 01:53:28.202
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

01:53:28.327 --> 01:53:29.453
between the two cities.

01:53:29.537 --> 01:53:30.621
These are air vents.

01:53:30.746 --> 01:53:32.206
They all lead
down to the tunnel

01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:34.500
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

01:53:34.667 --> 01:53:36.836
[Wonder Woman]
The nest could be there.

01:53:36.961 --> 01:53:38.921
[The Flash] Uh,
is he coming with us now,

01:53:39.046 --> 01:53:41.007
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

01:53:41.132 --> 01:53:42.591
I have something bigger.

01:53:43.718 --> 01:53:46.595
Do you really think that...

01:53:46.721 --> 01:53:50.308
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

01:53:50.349 --> 01:53:52.935
Oh. That's rude.

01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:06.907
[rats squeaking]

01:54:31.557 --> 01:54:33.601
We're close.

01:54:33.726 --> 01:54:35.895
The scent of the enemy.

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.772
Of absence.

01:54:38.272 --> 01:54:39.899
Darkness.

01:54:40.524 --> 01:54:41.901
Death.

01:54:42.068 --> 01:54:43.110
Where are we, Alfred?

01:54:43.235 --> 01:54:44.403
[Alfred over radio]
<i> Stryker's Island.</i>

01:54:44.487 --> 01:54:46.530
You should be directly under

01:54:46.614 --> 01:54:49.408
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

01:54:49.492 --> 01:54:50.868
<i> Now look to your left,</i>

01:54:50.951 --> 01:54:52.912

01:54:55.706 --> 01:54:57.041
[Batman] That's it.

01:54:57.166 --> 01:54:58.542
Let's go.

01:54:58.626 --> 01:55:00.795
[dramatic rock music resumes]

01:55:12.348 --> 01:55:15.101
[The Flash] Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

01:55:16.602 --> 01:55:17.853
Either of you?

01:55:17.978 --> 01:55:20.022
[Wonder Woman]
Don't engage alone.

01:55:20.147 --> 01:55:21.440
We do this together.

01:55:30.324 --> 01:55:32.118
I heard about you.

01:55:33.828 --> 01:55:35.412
Didn't think you were real.

01:55:35.496 --> 01:55:37.081
I'm real when it's useful.

01:55:47.174 --> 01:55:48.926
[Steppenwolf]
I grow tired of your silence.

01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:51.428
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:53.472
[parademons chittering]

01:55:58.310 --> 01:56:00.479
Please. We have families.

01:56:00.604 --> 01:56:02.857
Then you have weakness.

01:56:02.982 --> 01:56:04.358
Steppenwolf.

01:56:04.483 --> 01:56:08.821
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

01:56:08.988 --> 01:56:10.156
Good guess.

01:56:10.281 --> 01:56:14.034
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

You have been
near a Mother Box.

The scent is on you.

01:56:26.797 --> 01:56:28.340
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:56:28.507 --> 01:56:30.342
-Where is it?
-[Silas] Leave him alone!

01:56:30.509 --> 01:56:32.845

[Steppenwolf] You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

01:56:46.734 --> 01:56:49.028
I will die before I tell you.

I'll take it from here.

02:08:39.946 --> 02:08:41.740
U.S. government protocols

02:08:41.865 --> 02:08:44.868
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

[Wonder Woman]
It called to him.

02:08:50.957 --> 02:08:52.375
The Mother Box.

The one he already has.

02:08:54.085 --> 02:08:57.297
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

02:08:57.422 --> 02:08:59.925
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

02:09:00.008 --> 02:09:01.301
If he doesn't already have it.

02:09:04.846 --> 02:09:06.389
He doesn't have it.

02:09:09.392 --> 02:09:10.685

Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

02:09:31.998 --> 02:09:37.170
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

02:09:37.295 --> 02:09:39.422
The Anti-Life Equation.

02:09:39.506 --> 02:09:41.591
The key to

The world that fought back.

It is Earth.

I have seen it.

02:10:10.328 --> 02:10:13.540

[Steppenwolf] My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:11.348

Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

I will stride
across their bones

02:11:48.676 --> 02:11:51.262
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

02:11:51.346 --> 02:11:54.140
And all of existence

This one's saying
she can't fly

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:27.507
because of a software issue,

02:12:27.632 --> 02:12:29.759
but I could fix it
with a little time.

02:12:39.227 --> 02:12:41.771
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

02:12:41.855 --> 02:12:44.315
I could feel
the other two boxes.

02:12:44.399 --> 02:12:46.276
I know they're awake,

02:12:46.359 --> 02:12:47.902
but I can't see
where they are.

02:12:48.027 --> 02:12:50.155
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.323
Even if we knew,

02:12:52.407 --> 02:12:55.660
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

02:12:57.662 --> 02:12:59.038
Maybe one.

02:12:59.164 --> 02:13:01.583
Hmm, Superman.

[Victor] As long as
the third box is asleep,

02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:05.753
they can't see it,
only sense it.

02:13:05.879 --> 02:13:08.131
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

02:13:08.214 --> 02:13:09.632
No. That's just a strategy

02:13:09.757 --> 02:13:11.718
to lose more slowly,
not to win.

02:13:11.843 --> 02:13:14.679
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

02:13:14.762 --> 02:13:15.847
Why don't we just destroy it?

02:13:15.972 --> 02:13:18.057
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.

02:13:18.183 --> 02:13:20.101
They're an unknown form
of matter.

Oh, they love heat.

02:13:21.519 --> 02:13:23.688
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

02:13:23.813 --> 02:13:26.482
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

02:13:26.524 --> 02:13:27.817
Makes you think.

Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

Are you trying
to say something?

02:13:32.405 --> 02:13:34.157
Oh, I'm saying it.

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:36.534
How do we know you're not
working for them?

02:13:38.244 --> 02:13:40.288
It's a long story.

02:13:40.413 --> 02:13:42.248
You got somewhere else to be?

02:13:49.631 --> 02:13:51.090
The Nazis found the box

02:13:51.216 --> 02:13:53.551
at the end
of the Second World War,

02:13:53.635 --> 02:13:56.721
buried under
an Italian monastery.

02:13:56.804 --> 02:13:59.140
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

02:13:59.265 --> 02:14:02.185
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

02:14:02.227 --> 02:14:06.522
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

02:14:06.564 --> 02:14:08.441
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

02:14:08.566 --> 02:14:10.318
for 70 years

02:14:10.443 --> 02:14:13.947
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:17.742
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

02:14:17.825 --> 02:14:18.993
between the ship...

02:14:20.245 --> 02:14:22.247
and 6-1-9-8-2.

02:14:22.413 --> 02:14:26.084
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:28.253
Different civilizations,

02:14:28.336 --> 02:14:31.381
similar properties.

02:14:31.464 --> 02:14:34.884
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

02:14:35.009 --> 02:14:38.471
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

02:14:38.596 --> 02:14:40.598
And so did.

02:14:42.642 --> 02:14:43.810
Then...

02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:48.815
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:52.151
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

02:14:52.277 --> 02:14:54.862
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

02:14:56.531 --> 02:14:58.116
[powering up]

02:15:03.079 --> 02:15:05.581

02:15:10.837 --> 02:15:12.922
He unleashed
an alien technology

02:15:13.047 --> 02:15:15.842
he didn't fully understand.

02:15:15.967 --> 02:15:18.636
He used that power
to keep me alive.

02:15:19.721 --> 02:15:21.681
-[groans]

02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.933

02:15:23.975 --> 02:15:26.144
but turned into this.

02:15:28.813 --> 02:15:31.232
The box went back to sleep

02:15:31.983 --> 02:15:33.901
and he never returned it.

02:15:36.237 --> 02:15:38.656
That researcher
was Silas Stone.

02:15:40.241 --> 02:15:41.909
My father.

02:15:45.163 --> 02:15:46.789
Wait,

02:15:46.873 --> 02:15:50.168
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

02:15:50.335 --> 02:15:52.670
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

02:15:52.837 --> 02:15:55.131
They're change machines.

02:15:55.214 --> 02:15:58.384
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

02:15:58.509 --> 02:16:00.428
alive or dead.

02:16:00.553 --> 02:16:02.972
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

02:16:03.014 --> 02:16:04.766

02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:06.309
Reinstate?

02:16:06.434 --> 02:16:07.852
[Victor] A box has the power

02:16:07.935 --> 02:16:09.854
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

02:16:10.021 --> 02:16:11.856
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

02:16:11.981 --> 02:16:13.107
can't be created or destroyed,

02:16:13.232 --> 02:16:15.234
their relations
just transform.

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.196
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

02:16:18.279 --> 02:16:20.865
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:25.203
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:28.831
But a Mother Box...

02:16:28.956 --> 02:16:31.334
...turns smoke
back into a house.

02:16:32.210 --> 02:16:33.211
[sighs]

02:16:37.173 --> 02:16:39.926
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

02:16:41.094 --> 02:16:43.888
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

02:16:46.891 --> 02:16:49.060
[orchestral music playing]

02:17:10.915 --> 02:17:12.208
[Lois] Who is it?

02:17:12.792 --> 02:17:14.085
Martha.

02:17:18.756 --> 02:17:20.091
Hi.

02:17:21.843 --> 02:17:23.302
[softly] Hi.

02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:33.855
I went to the<i> Daily Planet</i>

02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:37.442
to finally pick up
Clark's things. [chuckles]

02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:42.280
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

02:17:44.949 --> 02:17:46.784
I lost the farm.

02:17:48.119 --> 02:17:50.371
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

02:17:51.706 --> 02:17:53.082
Truth is, the house is too big

02:17:53.207 --> 02:17:55.918
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

02:17:56.043 --> 02:17:58.963
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

02:17:59.046 --> 02:18:01.174
for as long as you need.

02:18:02.133 --> 02:18:05.052
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:08.723
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

02:18:08.848 --> 02:18:10.808
right by the diner.

02:18:10.892 --> 02:18:12.310
I'm not here for help.

02:18:13.478 --> 02:18:15.980
I'm here because

02:18:16.105 --> 02:18:18.816
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

02:18:20.026 --> 02:18:23.112
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

02:18:25.656 --> 02:18:26.949
[sighs softly]

02:18:27.784 --> 02:18:29.452
I can't.

02:18:36.209 --> 02:18:38.878
The whole world is mourning.

02:18:39.003 --> 02:18:40.046
[sighs]

02:18:40.171 --> 02:18:42.465
Grieving over a symbol.

02:18:42.590 --> 02:18:46.844
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

02:18:47.762 --> 02:18:49.805
I hear what people say.

02:18:49.889 --> 02:18:51.891
They talk like they knew him.

02:18:52.892 --> 02:18:55.311
But they didn't know Clark.

02:18:56.771 --> 02:18:59.065
And I can't stop them

02:18:59.190 --> 02:19:03.569
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

02:19:05.613 --> 02:19:08.032
You're the only one who knows.

02:19:08.157 --> 02:19:10.868
Who feels what I do.

02:19:11.911 --> 02:19:15.081
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

02:19:18.042 --> 02:19:21.546
I came all this way
because I wanted...

02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:23.589
because I wanted to see you.

02:19:24.841 --> 02:19:26.842
Tell you...

02:19:26.884 --> 02:19:28.970
I understand.

02:19:30.721 --> 02:19:32.682
I...

02:19:32.807 --> 02:19:36.852
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

02:19:40.481 --> 02:19:42.441
And I just miss him.

02:19:43.609 --> 02:19:46.028
I miss him so much.

02:19:46.112 --> 02:19:47.405
[Lois sniffles]

02:19:52.577 --> 02:19:54.245
So do I, sweetheart.

02:19:57.081 --> 02:19:58.583
[sighs]

02:19:58.708 --> 02:20:03.588
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

02:20:07.091 --> 02:20:09.969
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

02:20:12.138 --> 02:20:14.515
Come back to the living.

02:20:17.935 --> 02:20:19.103
[door opens]

02:20:28.237 --> 02:20:30.072
[suspenseful music plays]

02:20:54.305 --> 02:20:57.391
The world
needs you, too, Lois.

02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:02.355
[Arthur]<i> The dead are dead.</i>

02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:04.482
The box brought Victor back.

02:21:04.607 --> 02:21:06.067
Victor wasn't dead.

02:21:06.192 --> 02:21:07.985
Life is either one or zero.

02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:11.072
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

02:21:11.197 --> 02:21:12.823
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

02:21:12.948 --> 02:21:14.241
[Victor] Of course.

02:21:14.367 --> 02:21:16.661
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

02:21:16.744 --> 02:21:18.996
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

02:21:20.581 --> 02:21:22.166
-[Diana sighs]
-[Barry] Okay, but...

02:21:22.333 --> 02:21:26.629
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

02:21:26.671 --> 02:21:27.964
What do we have to lose?

02:21:28.089 --> 02:21:30.549
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

02:21:30.675 --> 02:21:32.093
As soon as it wakes up...

02:21:32.218 --> 02:21:34.679
...the enemy sees it, comes,

02:21:34.845 --> 02:21:37.306
activates The Unity.
The end.

02:21:37.390 --> 02:21:39.725
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

02:21:39.850 --> 02:21:42.019 line:50%
to a bunch
of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

02:21:42.144 --> 02:21:44.522
Even if Superman could return,

02:21:44.689 --> 02:21:46.816
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

02:21:46.899 --> 02:21:48.901
The Mother Box did.

02:21:49.026 --> 02:21:51.195
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:54.156
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

02:21:54.281 --> 02:21:56.200
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.

02:21:56.283 --> 02:21:57.868
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

02:21:57.993 --> 02:22:00.037
Not until Superman died.

02:22:00.204 --> 02:22:02.498
Not until Superman died.

02:22:02.623 --> 02:22:04.583
It's like they were
afraid of him?

02:22:04.709 --> 02:22:07.712
[Bruce] Yes,
they were afraid of him.

02:22:10.756 --> 02:22:12.550
This is the only way.

02:22:13.884 --> 02:22:18.055
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

02:22:34.238 --> 02:22:36.240
[Barry] Cross this one off
the bucket list.

02:22:36.323 --> 02:22:40.327
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

02:22:41.996 --> 02:22:44.707
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

02:22:45.458 --> 02:22:46.751
We could.

02:22:54.258 --> 02:22:56.093
He was my hero.

02:22:58.637 --> 02:22:59.764
All right.

02:23:03.309 --> 02:23:06.562
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

02:23:06.645 --> 02:23:07.813
Half-Atlantean.

02:23:09.607 --> 02:23:12.818
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

02:23:12.943 --> 02:23:17.073
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

02:23:17.156 --> 02:23:19.992
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

02:23:20.117 --> 02:23:22.286
Hate is useless.

02:23:25.456 --> 02:23:26.624
Yep.

02:23:27.958 --> 02:23:29.585
No, thank you.

02:23:34.006 --> 02:23:35.132
You know, my father told me

02:23:35.257 --> 02:23:37.176
there's a saying
in Atlantis...

02:23:38.636 --> 02:23:40.930
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

02:23:41.013 --> 02:23:42.223
"Not without..."

02:23:42.348 --> 02:23:43.849
"Not without
giving one up in return."

02:23:46.101 --> 02:23:47.686
We say the same thing.

02:23:50.272 --> 02:23:52.024
How about that?

02:23:52.149 --> 02:23:54.193
Wonder Woman.

02:23:55.319 --> 02:23:56.612
What do you think, man?

02:23:56.695 --> 02:23:59.490
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

02:23:59.615 --> 02:24:02.451
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

02:24:04.161 --> 02:24:06.205
Every guy's a younger guy.

02:24:07.998 --> 02:24:09.083
[Alfred] Jesus.

02:24:09.208 --> 02:24:10.626
[steam hissing]

02:24:10.668 --> 02:24:12.461
Oh, Christ.

02:24:14.713 --> 02:24:17.424
-[blasting]
-Oh, bloody...

02:24:18.717 --> 02:24:19.802
Any luck?

02:24:19.844 --> 02:24:21.220
If by "luck" you mean

02:24:21.345 --> 02:24:24.139
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

02:24:24.265 --> 02:24:26.475
then, no. No luck.

02:24:27.226 --> 02:24:28.686
[Bruce] It's okay.

02:24:28.769 --> 02:24:30.729
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

02:24:30.855 --> 02:24:31.981
to the Kryptonian ship.

02:24:32.106 --> 02:24:33.357
It's basically
an organic computer.

02:24:33.482 --> 02:24:35.192
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

02:24:35.359 --> 02:24:37.945
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:39.321
[Bruce] Something like that.

02:24:39.446 --> 02:24:43.242
[Alfred] Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

02:24:44.201 --> 02:24:45.578
[Alfred sighing]

02:24:49.748 --> 02:24:51.375
Master Wayne...

02:24:53.252 --> 02:24:54.628
you did it!

02:24:54.753 --> 02:24:58.299
You put the team together
to fight this war.

02:24:58.424 --> 02:25:01.510
You've fulfilled your promise.

02:25:01.594 --> 02:25:05.514
But to try to do that...
I mean...

02:25:05.639 --> 02:25:08.559
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

02:25:08.726 --> 02:25:10.853
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

02:25:10.895 --> 02:25:14.231 line:50%
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly
on faith,

02:25:14.356 --> 02:25:16.734
not on reason.

02:25:16.859 --> 02:25:21.197
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

02:25:21.322 --> 02:25:23.449
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

02:25:23.574 --> 02:25:26.535
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

02:25:26.619 --> 02:25:29.163
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

02:25:29.288 --> 02:25:31.081
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

02:25:31.165 --> 02:25:32.875
You do
when it's this red cape.

02:25:32.958 --> 02:25:35.252
This red cape charges back.

02:25:49.892 --> 02:25:50.976
Okay.

02:25:57.816 --> 02:26:00.319
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

02:26:00.444 --> 02:26:01.946
Everyone's clear,
including you.

02:26:02.112 --> 02:26:04.782
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

02:26:04.865 --> 02:26:06.784
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

02:26:06.867 --> 02:26:07.826
Absolutely.

02:26:11.664 --> 02:26:12.915
-Thanks.
-Listen up, everyone.

02:26:12.998 --> 02:26:15.626
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

02:26:15.751 --> 02:26:17.294
If you need
more medical attention...

02:26:17.378 --> 02:26:21.298
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

02:26:21.382 --> 02:26:22.800
-Definitely not "A."
-Okay.

02:26:22.925 --> 02:26:25.970
Or... "B"?

02:26:27.513 --> 02:26:28.889
Let me see "A" again?

02:26:34.395 --> 02:26:37.690
Right. We should get dressed.

02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:41.777
I'm always dressed.

02:26:43.362 --> 02:26:45.531

Aye, aye.

02:27:17.938 --> 02:27:19.314

02:27:42.338 --> 02:27:43.589
[soldier] Okay.

02:27:43.714 --> 02:27:45.924
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

02:27:52.973 --> 02:27:53.891
Doc!

02:27:53.974 --> 02:27:55.434
They let you out
of quarantine.

02:27:55.559 --> 02:27:56.977
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

02:27:57.102 --> 02:27:59.229
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

02:27:59.355 --> 02:28:00.647
with the electron-laser.

02:28:00.773 --> 02:28:02.900
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

02:28:16.288 --> 02:28:17.748
[Batman grunts softly]

02:28:17.873 --> 02:28:20.834
Victor, clear this place out.

Done.

A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

02:28:40.145 --> 02:28:41.396
It's gotta be a false alarm.

02:28:41.522 --> 02:28:43.565
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

02:28:43.607 --> 02:28:44.983
-Ryan, we just had it swept.
-We have to go, Doc.

02:52:23.567 --> 02:52:26.028 line:50%
[Aquaman]
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

02:52:26.111 --> 02:52:29.365
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

02:52:29.448 --> 02:52:30.991
[Batman] It is him.

02:52:31.033 --> 02:52:33.536
He recognized Lois Lane.

02:52:33.702 --> 02:52:35.830
-Who?
-The woman he loves.

02:52:35.913 --> 02:52:38.207
-He remembers her.
-[Aquaman] Nah.

02:52:38.374 --> 02:52:40.209
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

02:52:40.292 --> 02:52:42.002
It's called instinct, Diana.

02:52:47.508 --> 02:52:49.051
[Aquaman sighs]

02:52:49.176 --> 02:52:51.053
[The Flash] Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

02:52:51.178 --> 02:52:52.805
[Wonder Woman]
He's gone back to his base

02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:54.473
to assemble the three boxes.

02:52:54.598 --> 02:52:56.058
[Aquaman] And we don't know
where his base is.

02:52:56.225 --> 02:52:57.893
-Or how long until...
-[Batman] Hours.

02:52:57.977 --> 02:52:59.562
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

02:52:59.645 --> 02:53:02.898
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

02:53:02.982 --> 02:53:05.192
[whispers] This is not your...

02:53:05.317 --> 02:53:06.569
[gasps]

02:53:07.361 --> 02:53:08.862
He knew.

02:53:08.946 --> 02:53:10.489
He knew, he knew, he knew.

02:53:10.614 --> 02:53:12.575
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

02:53:12.658 --> 02:53:14.618
he was trying to superheat it.

02:53:14.743 --> 02:53:15.995
He made the core
the hottest thing

02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:17.246
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

02:53:17.371 --> 02:53:18.372
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

02:53:18.455 --> 02:53:19.665
[Batman]
Blink off the charts

02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:21.917
on a thermal imaging system.

02:53:22.084 --> 02:53:25.379
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

02:53:25.462 --> 02:53:27.423
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

02:53:27.548 --> 02:53:29.717
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

02:53:29.842 --> 02:53:31.218
I'm already on it.

02:53:31.302 --> 02:53:33.304
I'm sorry. [hesitates]
You have a satellite?

02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:34.722
I have six.

02:53:34.805 --> 02:53:36.056
Right.

02:53:37.474 --> 02:53:39.894
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

02:53:50.904 --> 02:53:52.448
[birds chirping]

02:53:52.573 --> 02:53:54.116
[soft music playing]

02:54:04.168 --> 02:54:06.420
You brought us here.

02:54:06.545 --> 02:54:07.671
You remembered.

02:54:08.631 --> 02:54:10.299
This is home.

02:54:12.051 --> 02:54:13.427
You spoke.

02:54:17.473 --> 02:54:19.350
Did I not before?

02:54:53.217 --> 02:54:56.011
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

02:54:57.221 --> 02:54:59.390
She never told anyone.

02:55:00.933 --> 02:55:02.726
I don't understand.

02:55:05.854 --> 02:55:08.357
She's a proud woman, Clark.

02:55:11.485 --> 02:55:12.736
Here.

02:55:27.751 --> 02:55:29.420
She loved it here.

02:55:36.051 --> 02:55:37.553
[birds chirping]

02:55:40.097 --> 02:55:41.765
So did I.

02:55:43.767 --> 02:55:45.310
So did I.

02:55:50.149 --> 02:55:51.608
[Clark sighs]

02:56:10.878 --> 02:56:12.129
[The Flash] Wow!

02:56:12.254 --> 02:56:13.922
This is awesome.

02:56:14.089 --> 02:56:15.632
[Bruce] Brought some friends.

02:56:22.139 --> 02:56:24.600
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

02:56:24.725 --> 02:56:27.352
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

02:56:27.478 --> 02:56:29.772
-Alfred.
-Good day, ma'am.

02:56:31.064 --> 02:56:33.233
[Alfred] Oh...

02:56:33.275 --> 02:56:34.485
[Alfred clears throat]

02:56:36.195 --> 02:56:38.280
It's badass, Alfred.

02:56:40.949 --> 02:56:43.494
Well, I'll put on the tea.

02:56:43.619 --> 02:56:44.745
Great.

02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:46.580
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

02:56:49.291 --> 02:56:52.252
[Bruce] There's the
Mother Box, right there.

02:56:52.294 --> 02:56:54.338
[Wonder Woman]
Go to visible spectrum.

02:56:56.173 --> 02:56:58.300
[sighs] Pozharnov.

02:56:58.425 --> 02:57:01.303
Ghost city
not far from Moscow.

02:57:01.428 --> 02:57:02.679
It's been abandoned since

02:57:02.805 --> 02:57:04.181
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

02:57:04.306 --> 02:57:05.599
Not even the army goes in.

02:57:05.682 --> 02:57:07.100
[Barry] Right, it's probably
so radioactive

02:57:07.226 --> 02:57:09.269
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

02:57:09.311 --> 02:57:10.729
Not anymore.

02:57:10.854 --> 02:57:12.606
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

02:57:12.689 --> 02:57:13.732
Zoom.

02:57:13.857 --> 02:57:15.234
[keyboard clacking]

02:57:17.569 --> 02:57:19.112
What the hell is he building?

02:57:19.196 --> 02:57:20.656
[Cyborg] The Unity's in there.

02:57:20.739 --> 02:57:22.116
We'll attack from above.

02:57:22.199 --> 02:57:24.910
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

02:57:25.035 --> 02:57:26.662
only strengthen their bond.

02:57:26.829 --> 02:57:28.163
[Barry] What?
So we can't blow it up?

02:57:28.247 --> 02:57:29.790
[Cyborg] Not from the outside.

02:57:31.291 --> 02:57:34.211
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

02:57:34.336 --> 02:57:35.712
Fuse with it.

02:57:35.838 --> 02:57:37.172
Weaken its bond
from the inside

02:57:37.339 --> 02:57:38.590
so we can break it back
into three.

02:57:38.715 --> 02:57:40.801
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

02:57:40.843 --> 02:57:44.555
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:47.182
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

02:57:47.266 --> 02:57:48.642
A billion years old.

02:57:48.725 --> 02:57:50.811
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

02:57:50.936 --> 02:57:53.355
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

02:57:53.438 --> 02:57:55.691
Just get me in
and get me time.

02:57:55.858 --> 02:57:56.984
You could die, Victor.

02:57:57.067 --> 02:57:59.528
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

02:58:04.116 --> 02:58:05.909
I got nothing left.

02:58:11.206 --> 02:58:13.375
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

02:58:16.295 --> 02:58:17.880
That's what I'm gonna do.

02:58:18.046 --> 02:58:20.382
[Barry] Okay. So...

02:58:20.507 --> 02:58:22.175
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

02:58:22.217 --> 02:58:23.760
by fusing
with the doom boxes,

02:58:23.886 --> 02:58:26.388
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

02:58:26.471 --> 02:58:29.349
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

02:58:29.391 --> 02:58:31.852
Fighting the devil
and his army

02:58:31.935 --> 02:58:33.187
in hell.

02:58:33.312 --> 02:58:35.355
[Barry] I mean,
this guy's probably fought

02:58:35.439 --> 02:58:37.691
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

02:58:37.774 --> 02:58:39.443
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

02:58:39.568 --> 02:58:41.195
And we have to assume
he's won.

02:58:41.236 --> 02:58:42.988
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

02:58:43.113 --> 02:58:44.406
in how many hells...

02:58:44.531 --> 02:58:48.243
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

02:58:48.327 --> 02:58:50.287
[hopeful music plays]

02:59:12.517 --> 02:59:14.227
[soft music playing]

02:59:38.502 --> 02:59:40.170
Take that as a "yes."

02:59:40.295 --> 02:59:41.755
[Lois] What?

02:59:45.175 --> 02:59:46.468
The ring.

02:59:50.138 --> 02:59:51.723
You're really back.

03:00:25.173 --> 03:00:27.509
I have a second chance, Lo.

03:00:29.553 --> 03:00:32.305
And I am not gonna waste it.

03:01:13.055 --> 03:01:14.556
[gasps softly]

03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:27.360
-[Martha laughing]
-[chuckles]

03:01:30.322 --> 03:01:31.531
Are you really you?

03:01:31.615 --> 03:01:34.034
I'm really me, Ma.

03:01:34.159 --> 03:01:36.036
[Martha laughs]

03:01:51.426 --> 03:01:53.595
Listen, Ma.

03:01:54.930 --> 03:01:57.099
They wanted me back
for a reason.

03:01:58.767 --> 03:02:00.560
I need to find out why.

03:02:02.562 --> 03:02:04.106
[Martha sighs]

03:02:20.497 --> 03:02:21.998
How's Victor doing?

03:02:26.294 --> 03:02:29.131
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

03:02:30.632 --> 03:02:33.760
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

03:02:33.844 --> 03:02:35.429
to go up against
the most powerful machines

03:02:35.512 --> 03:02:36.888
in the universe.

03:02:38.598 --> 03:02:40.142
It's not fair.

03:02:41.810 --> 03:02:43.645
I thought you didn't care?

03:02:45.021 --> 03:02:46.606
I never said that.

03:02:59.369 --> 03:03:00.871
What is it?

03:03:02.497 --> 03:03:04.541
Uh...

03:03:04.666 --> 03:03:07.752
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

03:03:07.878 --> 03:03:10.464
almost like a premonition.

03:03:10.589 --> 03:03:13.466
It was the end of the world

03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:16.469
and Barry Allen
was right here

03:03:16.553 --> 03:03:20.682
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

03:03:23.226 --> 03:03:26.563
She is... to Superman.

03:03:27.439 --> 03:03:29.483
Every heart has one.

03:03:29.608 --> 03:03:31.693
I think it's something more.

03:03:32.402 --> 03:03:34.529
Something darker.

03:03:38.492 --> 03:03:39.493
Master Wayne.

03:03:39.576 --> 03:03:41.745
Master Wayne!

03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:43.788
You need to see this.

03:03:46.583 --> 03:03:49.211
[triumphant music playing]

03:04:07.062 --> 03:04:08.647
You fixed it.

03:04:08.772 --> 03:04:10.690
It wanted to fly.

03:04:11.733 --> 03:04:13.235
Flight is its nature.

03:04:13.318 --> 03:04:14.736
Yours, too.

03:04:21.201 --> 03:04:23.370
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

03:04:23.453 --> 03:04:25.705
What makes you so sure?

03:04:25.747 --> 03:04:28.625
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

03:04:50.564 --> 03:04:52.190
At last.

03:04:53.900 --> 03:04:56.820
Prepare for his arrival.

03:04:58.530 --> 03:05:02.784
My redemption is nigh.

03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:12.085
Unite.

03:05:17.257 --> 03:05:19.801
Synchronize.

[Bruce]
The satellites revealed

03:06:05.430 --> 03:06:06.848
he's created a defensive dome.

03:06:07.015 --> 03:06:08.224
It's a design flaw.

03:06:08.350 --> 03:06:10.518
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

03:06:10.602 --> 03:06:12.812
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

03:06:12.896 --> 03:06:14.481
[The Flash] Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

03:06:14.564 --> 03:06:16.691
anyone would be that nuts.

03:06:17.525 --> 03:06:18.818
Bruce is right.

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:20.362
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

03:06:20.528 --> 03:06:22.989
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

03:06:23.073 --> 03:06:24.866
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

03:06:24.991 --> 03:06:26.368
It'll be destroyed.

03:06:26.451 --> 03:06:28.328
[Wonder Woman] Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

03:06:28.411 --> 03:06:29.663
with Barry's help,

03:06:29.788 --> 03:06:31.664
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

03:06:31.748 --> 03:06:33.375
[Aquaman] Remind me,
how's that again?

03:06:33.458 --> 03:06:34.876
Uh, with the power of love.

-With a catastrophic

03:06:38.088 --> 03:06:39.339
Good.

03:06:39.506 --> 03:06:41.216
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

03:06:41.299 --> 03:06:43.718
to generate
a charge of that size.

03:06:43.885 --> 03:06:46.054
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

03:06:46.137 --> 03:06:49.015
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

03:06:49.140 --> 03:06:51.101
And, Victor,
it's all up to you.

03:06:51.226 --> 03:06:54.437
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

03:06:54.562 --> 03:06:58.274
[The Flash] Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:00.151
[Bruce] We have a plan.

I want you to know

your kid was one of them, Dad.

Make your own past.

03:28:26.269 --> 03:28:30.107

for you, Victor.

03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:22.451
My broken boy.

03:29:24.619 --> 03:29:26.872
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

03:29:26.913 --> 03:29:28.665
We'll be together again.

03:29:36.339 --> 03:29:38.592
[Mother Box as Victor]
we can put it back, Vic.

Steppenwolf would fail.

03:32:05.906 --> 03:32:09.576
Yes. Yes, you did.

03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:11.453
My master,

03:32:11.578 --> 03:32:15.373
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

03:32:15.415 --> 03:32:19.377
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

03:32:19.461 --> 03:32:22.797
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

03:32:22.923 --> 03:32:27.844
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

03:32:30.972 --> 03:32:32.599
Ready the armada.

03:32:33.350 --> 03:32:35.852

03:37:38.738 --> 03:37:41.532
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

03:37:41.574 --> 03:37:44.118
But, uh,
my foot's in the door.

03:37:44.244 --> 03:37:45.912
This is like a "job" job?

"Job" job.

for what you did.

you were a few clowns
short of a circus.

[chuckles] I was, thank you,

03:43:07.608 --> 03:43:09.860
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

find some much needed clarity.

Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

03:43:17.577 --> 03:43:19.370
[sighs] It's personal.

Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

03:43:24.458 --> 03:43:26.252
You said you had something
I'd want?

03:43:26.335 --> 03:43:27.878
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

03:43:27.920 --> 03:43:30.047
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

03:43:30.131 --> 03:43:31.966
No, I wouldn't think of it.

03:43:32.091 --> 03:43:33.301
Uh, I have too much
to live for.

03:43:33.426 --> 03:43:36.554

to do.

Hmm. On second thought,

03:43:56.657 --> 03:43:58.951
we do have something
to celebrate.

03:45:05.685 --> 03:45:07.019
Clear.

03:45:12.191 --> 03:45:14.026
How much further?

03:45:15.069 --> 03:45:16.362
We're almost there.

03:45:18.364 --> 03:45:20.074
Well, we need to hurry.

03:45:20.199 --> 03:45:21.826
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

03:45:21.909 --> 03:45:23.577
He'll come for us.

[Mera] Let him come.

Let the bastard come.

03:45:31.544 --> 03:45:33.796
I'll stab this
through his heart

03:45:33.921 --> 03:45:36.090
for what he did to Arthur.

03:45:36.215 --> 03:45:38.342
I want to make him pay.

03:45:39.719 --> 03:45:42.680
I understand
how you feel, Mera.

03:45:42.763 --> 03:45:45.433
You have no idea how I feel.

03:45:45.558 --> 03:45:47.393
But we have to
stick to the plan

03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:49.937
to have any chance
to make this right.

[man]<i> Au contraire,</i>

what it's like

to lose someone he loves.

03:46:27.683 --> 03:46:30.102
You know, like, uh,

03:46:31.145 --> 03:46:32.646
a father,

03:46:34.064 --> 03:46:36.233
like a mother.

03:46:36.317 --> 03:46:39.528
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

03:46:41.113 --> 03:46:43.282
Like an adopted son.

03:46:46.911 --> 03:46:48.579
Isn't that right,

Maybe, in a way,

03:46:56.212 --> 03:46:58.130 line:20%
that smelly
old flounder is right.

03:46:59.673 --> 03:47:02.426
Because how many
can die in your arms

03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:04.261
before you grow numb to death?

03:47:05.763 --> 03:47:08.516
That's not very careful.

03:47:08.641 --> 03:47:12.436
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

03:47:12.478 --> 03:47:15.356
before you die inside
yourself?

03:47:15.481 --> 03:47:19.193
I've been dead inside
a long time,

03:47:19.318 --> 03:47:21.278
but even I have a limit.

03:47:21.362 --> 03:47:23.197
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

03:47:23.322 --> 03:47:26.200
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

03:47:26.325 --> 03:47:28.327
You won't kill me.

03:47:29.036 --> 03:47:31.121
I'm your best friend.

03:47:31.205 --> 03:47:35.626
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around? [chuckles]

03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:39.129
Anyway,

03:47:40.214 --> 03:47:41.799
you need me.

03:47:42.842 --> 03:47:44.593
You

03:47:44.718 --> 03:47:47.555
need me to help you
undo this world

03:47:47.680 --> 03:47:50.558
you created
by letting her die.

03:47:53.060 --> 03:47:55.020
Poor Lois.

03:47:55.104 --> 03:47:57.898
How she suffered so!

03:47:58.774 --> 03:47:59.859
[sighs]

03:48:03.863 --> 03:48:06.031
I often wonder

03:48:06.198 --> 03:48:07.992
how many
alternate timelines

03:48:08.117 --> 03:48:10.452
do you destroy
the world because...

03:48:11.370 --> 03:48:12.997
frankly, you don't have

03:48:13.122 --> 03:48:15.708
the cojones to die yourself.

03:48:16.709 --> 03:48:18.252
Hmm?

03:48:20.212 --> 03:48:21.380
So, as usual,

03:48:21.505 --> 03:48:24.216
I'll be the bigger man.

03:48:25.342 --> 03:48:26.552
[blows air]

03:48:27.887 --> 03:48:29.471
A truce,

03:48:30.180 --> 03:48:31.891
Bruce.

03:48:32.057 --> 03:48:34.059
[cackling]

03:48:34.226 --> 03:48:38.439
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

03:48:41.317 --> 03:48:42.318
But all you have to do

03:48:42.443 --> 03:48:43.527
is tear it in half

03:48:43.652 --> 03:48:45.070
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

03:48:45.196 --> 03:48:47.781
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

03:48:49.450 --> 03:48:51.452
to do a man's job?

03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:56.498
You know, it's funny

03:48:56.624 --> 03:48:58.083
that you would talk
about people

03:48:58.167 --> 03:48:59.668
who died in my arms

03:48:59.793 --> 03:49:01.545
because when I held
Harley Quinn

03:49:01.629 --> 03:49:04.215
and she was bleeding
and dying,

03:49:04.340 --> 03:49:08.052
she begged me
with her last breath

03:49:08.093 --> 03:49:10.387
that when I killed you,

03:49:10.471 --> 03:49:14.058
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

03:49:14.141 --> 03:49:15.976
that I'd do it slow.

03:49:17.186 --> 03:49:19.313
I'm gonna honor that promise.

03:49:49.802 --> 03:49:52.638
Oh. You're good.

03:49:56.850 --> 03:49:58.519
You almost had me.

03:50:04.817 --> 03:50:06.777
[cackling]

03:50:13.117 --> 03:50:14.827
[Joker continues cackling]

03:50:17.746 --> 03:50:18.998
Where are we holing up?

03:50:19.164 --> 03:50:21.625
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

03:50:21.667 --> 03:50:24.628
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

03:50:24.712 --> 03:50:27.506
-[Joker blows raspberry]
-what do you think?

03:50:29.466 --> 03:50:31.176
[armor beeps]

03:50:31.343 --> 03:50:32.803
[distant explosion]

03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:34.596
He's found us.

03:50:56.410 --> 03:50:57.995
[cackling]

03:51:13.135 --> 03:51:14.386
[gasps]

03:51:16.388 --> 03:51:17.973
[breathing heavily]

03:51:30.069 --> 03:51:31.945
[distant explosions]

03:52:03.602 --> 03:52:06.146
Can I help you?

03:52:06.271 --> 03:52:09.900
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

03:52:09.942 --> 03:52:13.028
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

03:52:13.153 --> 03:52:16.156
We have to find it
before he does.

03:52:16.281 --> 03:52:18.158
There's a war coming.

03:52:18.283 --> 03:52:20.119
And I'm here to help.

03:52:20.244 --> 03:52:22.454
I'm sorry, who are you again?

03:52:22.579 --> 03:52:24.706
I've gone by many names

03:52:24.832 --> 03:52:28.043
and taken many forms.
And like you,

03:52:28.168 --> 03:52:30.838
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

03:52:30.963 --> 03:52:33.715
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

03:52:34.299 --> 03:52:35.634
Oh.

03:52:37.010 --> 03:52:39.304
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

03:52:39.471 --> 03:52:42.808
So, glad you're here.

03:52:43.809 --> 03:52:44.935
You know, I never thought

03:52:44.977 --> 03:52:46.186
I'd see
the defenders of Earth

03:52:46.311 --> 03:52:49.148
united and fighting as one.

03:52:49.231 --> 03:52:51.900
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:55.779
Your mother and father
would be proud.

03:52:57.072 --> 03:52:58.198
I hope so.

03:53:04.288 --> 03:53:07.207
Well, I'll be in touch.

03:53:08.250 --> 03:53:12.337
Oh, and some have called me

03:53:12.463 --> 03:53:14.840
the Martian Manhunter.

03:53:22.431 --> 03:53:24.892
