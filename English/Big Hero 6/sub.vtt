I am also a school mascot.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.080
So, what's your major?

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:15.599
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.760
But I am a major science enthusiast.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.960
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:24.119
that can turn me into a
fire-breathing lizard at will.

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:26.520
But she's says that's "not science."

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760
It's really not.

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:29.479
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:32.440
I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either.

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:33.640
- Is it?
- Nope.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.479
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.679
- TADASHI: Hiro.
- lmagine eating a sandwich,

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.799
but everybody
just thinks you're crazy.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.919
Just stop.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.200
FRED: Laser eyes?
HONEY LEMON: What?

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:45.119
FRED: Tingly fingers?
WASABI: Never gonna happen.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.320
FRED: Hey, what about
a growth serum, huh?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.440
So, uh, what have
you been working on?

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:49.799
I'll show you.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.960

Hello. I am Baymax.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:34.080
Your personal
healthcare companion.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.559
I was alerted to the need

00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:39.000
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:41.359
A robotic nurse.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:45.359
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:47.359
Physical or emotional?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.679
I will scan you now.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.719
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.440
I suggest
an anti-bacterial spray.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.119
What's in the spray, specifically?

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:06.200
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.520
(CLICKS TONGUE)
That's a bummer.

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:08.880
I'm actually allergic to that.

00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:10.960
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.239
You do have a mild allergy to

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:14.559
peanuts.

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.200
Hmm. Not bad.

00:12:16.479 --> 00:12:18.880
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:22.039
Uh-huh. Programmed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.719
This chip is what
makes Baymax, Baymax.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:32.799
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.080
Looks like
a walking marshmallow.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.640
- No offence.
- BAYMAX: I am a robot.

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:38.080
I cannot be offended.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.239
-Hyperspectral cameras?
-TADASHI: Yep.

-TADASHI: Carbon fibre.

00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:50.280
Right. Even lighter. (GASPS)

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.760
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.520
Oh, machined them
right here, in—house.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:55.919
-Really?
-Yup.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.599
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760
Shut up.

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:02.440
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.760
Nice.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.359
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

Well then,
I'm satisfied with my care.

Hey, what kind of battery
does it use?

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760
Lithium ion.

00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:21.599
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.000
Huh.

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:24.880

that's all she wanted to do.

That's right.

Ever think about applying here?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.559

Oh, I don't know.

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:04.159
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.

00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:05.640
Well, kind of serious.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880
I can see why.

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:09.000
With your bot,
winning must come easy.

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:10.919
Yeah, I guess.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.400
Well, if you like things easy,
then my programme isn't for you.

to this nerd school,

a student showcase.

You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away, you're in.

But, it's gotta be great.

Oh. Welcome to mi casa.

00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:05.239
That's French for "front door."

00:51:30.239 --> 00:51:31.840
this is your house?

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.800
I thought you lived under a bridge.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.879
Well, technically,
it belongs to my parents.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.159
They're on a vacay on the family island.

00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:41.560
You know, we should
totally go some time. Frolic.

If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.840
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.

Your body temperature is still low.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.879
Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.919
Ahh!

00:52:12.879 --> 00:52:15.479
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.320
Hmm, it's so nice.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.199
Oh, yeah, ah, that's toasty.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.560

00:52:20.959 --> 00:52:23.000
Good robot.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.800
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.959
-Yes! It's a bird!
-No!

00:52:31.199 --> 00:52:33.080
The guy in the mask
was carrying something

00:52:33.239 --> 00:52:34.439
with this symbol on it.

00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:37.760
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:39.520
Apprehend him?

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.000
We don't even know who he is.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.760
I have a theory.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.840
WASABI: "Dr Slaughter, MD"?

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.040
Actually,
millionaire weapons designer,

00:52:48.239 --> 00:52:49.520
Malcolm Chazzletick.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.080
"The Annihilator"?

00:52:51.159 --> 00:52:54.800
Behind the mask,
industrialist Reid Axworthy.

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:59.040
"Baron von Destruct"?
Oh, just get to the point!

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.360
Don't you guys get it?

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.840
The man in the mask who attacked us

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.360
is none other than...

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080
Voila!

00:53:06.159 --> 00:53:07.360
Alistair Krei.

00:53:07.639 --> 00:53:09.080
-What?
-FRED: Think about it.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.560
Krei wanted your microbots,

00:53:10.719 --> 00:53:11.719
and you said no.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.320
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

00:53:14.679 --> 00:53:17.399
HIRO: There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

00:53:17.679 --> 00:53:19.439
Then who was that guy in the mask?

00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:21.199
(STAMMERING) I don't know.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.439
We don't know anything about him.

00:53:23.679 --> 00:53:25.879

His blood type is AB—negative.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.439
Cholesterol levels are...

00:53:27.679 --> 00:53:28.719
Baymax, you scanned him?

00:53:28.959 --> 00:53:31.800
I am programmed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.399
Yes! (LAUGHS)

00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:35.959
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.719
Uh, you'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.919
That might take, I don't know, forever.

00:53:42.159 --> 00:53:43.520
No,no,no,no.L”

00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:45.800
I just have to look for another angle.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.399
Got it!

00:53:47.679 --> 00:53:49.639
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

00:53:49.879 --> 00:53:52.120
l just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

00:53:55.199 --> 00:53:57.040
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

00:53:57.879 --> 00:53:59.639
I need to upgrade all of you.

00:53:59.879 --> 00:54:00.919
Upgrade who, now?

00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:03.679
Those who suffer a loss require support

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.600
from friends and loved ones.

00:54:05.719 --> 00:54:08.120
(LAUGHS) Oh, okay,
I like where this is heading!

00:54:08.399 --> 00:54:10.800
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.399
Hiro, we want to help,

00:54:12.639 --> 00:54:14.520
but we're just us.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.840
No.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.239
You can be way more.

must be in his mask.

Dad, ljust wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.

You mean so much to me,
and honestly,

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.839
I've always felt a distance

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.240
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

01:40:33.959 --> 01:40:35.640
and ljust wish
you could see how...
