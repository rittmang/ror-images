00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.457
- Hey.
- Yeah, Jon Neal here.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.963
You just had sex with me in a hotel
and left without saying goodbye?

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:11.263
Yeah, it ended up being delayed
so... sorry, I was panicking.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.303
Well, if I don't get
to see you again...

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.203
...I just wanted to say it
was nice to see you again.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.901
Yeah, it was nice
to see you too.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.912
And listen, use that other
e-mail I gave you...

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.051
...because that's the
only secure one, okay?

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.708
Okay.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.645
You all right?

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.417
Yeah, I'm just...

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.923
I'm just jet-lagged. I'm tired.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.688
You should go home and get some
rest. Hong Kong's a long way.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.689
Oh, wait.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.391
Is that you?

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.537
Yep, that's me. They're
calling my flight.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:48.196
All right. Well look, I'm
really glad you called.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.569
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.906
Please have your boarding
passes out and ready.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.541
Thanks.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.908
- Good morning, Roger.
- Hey.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.481
So you really kicked ass
in that football pool.

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.950
You need to give up on your Lions.
Pick with your head, not your heart.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.418
Yeah, thank you for the tip.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.079
- Hey, hey. Hey, doc...
- Yeah?

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.122
I know you're busy. I...

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.317
- You got a second?
- Sure.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:55.859
I got a medical question.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.090
My kid's been having
problems at school.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.167
- Attention deficit thing.
- ADHD?

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.667
- Yeah.
- He been diagnosed yet?

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.964
That's the thing. They
want him to see someone.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.335
I was wondering if you could
take a look at him?

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.876
- I'm not really that kind of doctor.
- I didn't know. I just thought...

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.707
Maybe I can refer
someone, though.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.473
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's treatable.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.140
We'll find someone, have
them take a look.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.911
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Okay.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.452
- All right.
- Yup.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.089
- Thanks, doc.
- You're welcome.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.221
Why doesn't anybody
help him? Is he okay?

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.423
Read the posts.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.532
Some say it was staged.
An art project.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.196
Some say the authorities
wouldn't do an autopsy.

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.671
Covered it up.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.333
- Covered what up?
- We don't know.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:49.441
Maybe Minamata disease. You know,
from mercury in the fish.

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.846
There have been outbreaks in the past.
Fishing industry suppresses it.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.681
- "Industrial disease".
- Yeah but it's just one man.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.289
- We don't know what happened.
- Just one man on video.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.154
Not everyone has the foresight
to die in front of a camera.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.555
The ones we don't
see worry me.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.459
Fish is shipped all over
the world from there.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.122
How many people read your paper
over a plate of sushi?

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.429
Alan, we have almost no freelance
budget anymore and after H1...

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:15.096
You wait. A few days,
this will be tweeted...

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:17.799
We don't wanna be the
paper that cries wolf.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.410
I'll show it to Hobart.
He does our health stuff.

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:24.300
You're gonna give
him my story.
64b

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.040
You're gonna give him
my story, aren't you?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.017
No, Alan, I'm trying to help you.
It's just one man on a bus.

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.918
- I taped this meeting.
- We need more information than that.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.992
This story runs in the Chronicle,
I will sue your ass.

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.629
Great. Okay, bye, Alan.
Don't call me anymore.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.823
Print media is dying, Lorraine.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.833
It's dying. I'll save
you a seat on the bus.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.314
Hi, I'm Mitch Emhoff. I'm Clark's
stepdad. Clark Morrow?

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.347
All right, I'll let
him know you're here.

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:00.042
Okay.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:02.413
He said he was feeling very
warm in Mrs. Tatum's class.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.918
I took his temperature again since I
called. It was a touch over a hundred.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:11.154
Okay. Well, first his mom and
now the mighty Clark...

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.128
All right, let's go get some
soup for you and Mom.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.131
Hope you feel better
Clark, okay?

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.099
Okay. Thank you.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.295
Attaboy.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:22.498
We're gonna beat this thing
down by Turkey Day.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.211
Jory's going straight from the
band trip to her mom's place.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.083
And my job interview got
pushed to next week.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.919
I'm not really sure what that
means. Hopefully nothing.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:45.630
Hey.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.790
My arm.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.927
Come here, sit down, sit down.
Watch your feet. Come on.

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.903
Come on. Come on, honey.

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.477
Okay, what happened? Did you
take too much of that flu shit?

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:06.576
Honey? Beth, Beth. Hey, hey,
hey. Honey, honey.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:10.813
Beth. Jesus. Jesus.
Sweetheart. Hey, Beth.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.391
- Mom?
- No, no. Stay there, Clark. Don't...

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.051
Just go... up to
your room, honey.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.288
Honey, honey.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.896
- Beth.
- Beth, can you hear me?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.004
My name's Dr. Arrington.
You're in the hospital.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.003
You had a seizure
this morning, Beth.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.233
- She have a history of seizures?
- No, no, no.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.934
- Allergies?
- I think she's allergic to penicillin.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:36.275
- She fall recently? Hit her head?
- No, she came back from a trip...

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.314
What about drugs?
MDMA? Ecstasy?

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:40.076
No. No, we don't do that.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.915
- Okay, let's get some help in here.
- Jesus. Beth. Beth.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.750
Sir, you have to go.
You have to go.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.414
Let's get a line in her.

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.984
And give me 2 milligrams
of Ativan, please.

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:56.532
So, despite all our efforts,
she failed to respond.

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.670
- Okay.
- And her heart stopped...

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.932
...and unfortunately,
she did die.

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.735
Right.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.437
- I'm sorry, Mr. Emhoff.
- I know this is hard to accept.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:10.104
Okay. I mean, so can
I go talk to her?

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:14.344
Mr. Emhoff, I'm sorry.
Your wife is dead.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.419
I mean, I just saw her.
We were just at home.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.391
Is there somebody
that we can call?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.327
Someone who you think
should be here with you?

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:36.537
I mean, we had dinner. We had pizza.
She said she was jet-lagged.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:39.109
You mentioned that she
was away. Hong Kong?

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.346
We checked the latest bulletins.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.948
The only things there
were measles and H1N1...

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:46.346
...and this was not that.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.214
Then what was it?

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.684
We don't always know.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:53.882
I mean, some people get a disease
and live, some get sicker and die.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.324
We're gonna have to notify
the medical examiner...

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.395
...and they may
request an autopsy.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.032
Or if you wish,
we can order one.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.499
But I can't guarantee it's gonna
tell you any more than I can.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.504
I mean, my best guess is that this was
either meningitis or encephalitis...

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.734
...and with encephalitis, we're
in the dark a lot of the time.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:16.109
If it was summer, I might say a
bug bite, you know, West Nile.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.546
- I don't know...
- Herpes can cause encephalitis.

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.152
She didn't have herpes.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.912
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.920
What happened to her?

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.086
- What happened to her?!
- Okay, okay.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.491
Mr. Emhoff, there are
grief counselors...

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:35.327
...who are very helpful with
this sort of passing, okay?

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:38.334
You might find some
resolution there.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.836
Now, I am sorry.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.193
Hello?

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:08.792
Hang up the phone and call 911
right now. Right now. 911.

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:12.168
He said he had a headache,
so I put him to bed.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.465
I don't think he's breathing.

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.709
Clark. Clark.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.746
Oh, my God, is he dead?

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:03.749
What we are hearing from Beijing is
that the outbreak is contained...

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:06.016
...to the Chrysanthemum
complex in Hong Kong.

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.660
Two deaths and ten
suspected cases.

00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:39.655
How are we defining "contained"?

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.821
They're using the same protocols
established for SARS.

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:45.759
They're quarantining the complex
and screening for symptoms.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.593
Kowloon is the most densely
populated area in the world...

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.633
...and Hong Kong is a harbor.

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:51.929
It's going to spread.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.698
Hong Kong is sending
us blood samples.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:57.434
We're also looking at
samples from London.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.410
One at a hotel, the other
at a health club.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.549
Five dead, encephalitis.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:08.778
And there's the man
on the bus in Tokyo.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:13.084
- Three dead in that cluster.
- Any of them travel to China or London?

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.323
We're checking.

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:21.026
Mr. Neal, I want you
to stay with me here.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.694
Can you hear me? Have you had
seizures before, Mr. Neal?

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.863
- I want you to open your eyes if you can.
- He's breathing, right?

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.442
I couldn't wake him. I got
home, I couldn't wake him.

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.909
We both woke up sick
this morning.

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:37.546
Watch your head.

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:03.067
Well, the sulci are obliterated.
Let's look at the base.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:09.277
Oh, my God.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:12.046
You want me to take
a sample, or..?

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:14.743
I want you to move
away from the table.

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:19.516
- Should I call someone, or..?
- Call everyone.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:31.402
Well, these things happen
up there from time to time.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.596
Meningitis in a college dorm
after a swim meet...

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:38.300
...or West Nile in some
summer camp near a lake.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:42.538
I was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.910
A hundred and three cases,
mainly children.

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:47.712
Well, it's probably too cold
up there for that right now.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.856
As of last night, there were five
deaths and thirty-two cases.

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:53.014
There's a cluster in
an elementary school.

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:55.626
That's the kind of thing you
have to be prepared for.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.386
It's gonna be all
over the news.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.430
What's your single overriding
communications objective?

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:04.126
We're isolating the sick and quarantining
those who we believe were exposed.

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.827
Okay, good.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.769
As of this moment, you and I are
attached at the cell phone.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.472
If you need resources, call me.
191b

00:15:10.473 --> 00:15:12.672
If you get into a political
dogfight, call me.

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:15.837
If you find yourself wide awake,
staring at the walls at 3 AM...

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:18.245
...wondering why you
took the job, call me.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.681
I sure hope you packed something
warmer than that.

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:24.380
We're looking at around zero
with the windchill.

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:27.586
Don't want you to catch cold.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.927
Do you wanna go to the hotel
first, get situated?

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:35.692
I'd prefer to get started,
if that's possible.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.859
- Okay.
- How far is the office?

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:40.062
About a half-hour from here.

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:00.890
Your dad's in isolation.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.425
You can go up to the window, pick up
the phone and you can talk to him.

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.508
- Hey.
- Dad.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.045
- Hey.
- Are you sick?

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:25.684
No, no, no. I'm...

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:29.446
This is all just, you know, a precaution.
They're, you know, just making sure.

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:32.249
But you were with them.
You could still get it.

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:36.520
No, I won't. They said this
happens really, really fast.

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:40.222
And I'm fine. There's
nothing wrong with me.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:44.130
There's nothing wrong with me.
We're okay. We're okay.

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:47.336
And Clark?

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.569
Yeah, you know, I...

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:59.174
I wasn't there. I went in
the ambulance with Beth.

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:03.048
And I just didn't... I...

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:06.191
I left him with Carrie Anne.

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.655
I should have been there.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.591
- I could have helped.
- No, no, no. Honey, no, no.

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.754
It's good that you weren't
there. I'm happy.

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:16.025
If something had happened
to you, I mean, I'd...

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:20.297
Honey, you're here now, you
know. I'm happy about that.

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.497
I'm happy about that.

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.470
When are you coming home?

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:28.135
Soon. Very soon.
They you know...

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:31.441
- Why don't you go to your mom's?
- No.

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.882
- Just stay in Wisconsin.
- No. She doesn't need me.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:39.354
She's got Dan. I live here.

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:44.658
You don't have anybody.
I'm not leaving you.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.957
We have forty-seven cases and eight
deaths as of 5:00 this afternoon.

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:51.625
It's a weekend. These
numbers might be low.

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.864
People are staying home for a couple
days, see if they get better.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.907
At this point, I think we have
to believe this is respiratory.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.807
- Maybe fomites too.
- What's that, fomites?

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:04.210
It refers to transmission
from surfaces.

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:07.784
The average person touches their face
two or three thousand times a day.

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:13.220
- Two or three thousand times a day?
- Three to five times every waking minute.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.327
In between, we're
touching doorknobs...

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.225
...water fountains, elevator
buttons and each other.

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.798
Those things become fomites.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:25.334
Is this something we wanna release to
the press? Respiratory and fomites?

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:29.201
- How's the public gonna react?
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:32.866
will keep people from getting in the
ocean but a warning on cigarettes...

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.503
We need to walk the governor through
this before we freak everybody out.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:40.914
I mean, we can't even tell people right
now what they should be afraid of.

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:44.180
We tried that with swine flu. All we
did was get healthy people scared.

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.153
It's the biggest shopping
weekend of the year.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.122
We need to consider
closing schools.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:51.524
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.961
Government workers. People
that work at hospitals.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.660
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.134
Things that keep people calm.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:04.969
What we need to
determine is this:

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.874
For every person
who gets sick...

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:11.641
...how many other people are
they likely to infect?

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:15.481
So for seasonal flu, that's
usually about one.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:19.215
Smallpox on the other
hand, it's over three.

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:20.858
Now, before we had a vaccine...

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:25.360
...polio spread at a rate
between four and six.

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:28.557
Now, we call that number...

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:30.962
...the R-nought.

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:35.971
R stands for the reproductive
rate of the virus.

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.405
Any ideas what that
might be for this?

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:42.741
How fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.782
The incubation period, how
long a person is contagious.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:49.182
Sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.015
We need to know that too.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.354
We need to know how big the population of
people susceptible to the virus might be.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.587
So far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:02.757
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able to
get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.768
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:07.735
We sent samples to the CDC.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.268
In 72 hours we'll know what
it is, if we're lucky.

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.310
Clearly, we're not lucky.

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.605
What do we got?

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:50.236
A young woman in Minnesota,
recently traveled to China.

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.542
Son also died.

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:57.314
As of this morning,
87 cases, 15 deaths.

00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:00.014
- Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
- I worked.

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:01.352
You? Really?

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:06.122
Texas. Salmonella.
Pretty limited.

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:08.892
Mine was great, thanks.

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.679
It's pleomorphic but tends
toward ovoid in shape.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.785
I see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins...

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.387
...but there's nothing
morphologically pathognomonic.

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:33.547
We tested all her antibodies. I
didn't see much cross-reactivity.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.092
Her body had no idea what to do
with it. It just kept amplifying.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:39.127
Send it to Sussman
in San Francisco.

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.391
If he doesn't know what
it is, nobody does.

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:46.162
It shows novel characteristics and
appears to be chimeric in origin.

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:52.299
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length
and containing six to 10 genes.

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.172
Typical of a paramyxovirus.

00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:58.976
It's Godzilla, King Kong and
Frankenstein all in one.

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.915
- Hold on. Shit, I'll call you back.
- You've got it in there.

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:04.521
- Get away from here.
- Where'd it come from? Military?

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.022
You're not a doctor and
you're not a writer.

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:09.387
Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am.

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:13.190
Blogging is not writing. It's
graffiti with punctuation.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:17.062
I am a journalist, and there's informed
discussion on the blogosphere...

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:19.226
...that this is a
biological weapon.

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:23.465
You wanna talk to me, call my
office and make an appointment.

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:28.969
- Dr. Cheever?
- Yes.

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:32.241
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:35.750
We found him. Tell the unit on the
way to his house to come in.

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:38.185
Excuse me. Who are you?

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:41.417
My name is Dennis French with the
Department of Homeland Security.

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.424
And what's this all about?

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:46.928
Rear Admiral Haggerty's expecting us
in the emergency operations center.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.294
We can discuss it there.

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:51.265
This happened in Kowloon.

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:55.429
Today we've got workers at a casino
in Macao striking over conditions.

00:22:55.607 --> 00:23:00.101
Three have died in one bunkhouse, CIA
thinks there may be a connection.

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:04.339
Casinos are of particular concern
to Homeland Security.

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:07.952
Someone's ready to blow themselves up
at a pizzeria or the local market...

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.782
the thought of getting themselves
sick with smallpox...

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:14.187
...and walking through a crowded
casino must have crossed their mind.

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.486
What did they die
of, the three?

00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.255
Reports are vague.
Seizures, comas.

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:23.026
We've reached out to the WHO,
see what they know.

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:25.795
If you were gonna plan it,
can't think of a better time.

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:28.303
- Plan what?
- An attack.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.645
Is there any way someone could
weaponize the bird flu?

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:37.680
Someone doesn't have to
weaponize the bird flu.

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:39.908
The birds are doing that.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:43.145
Officials are reporting the closing
of Mondale Elementary School...

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.845
in suburban Minneapolis...

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:48.083
in response to the recent outbreak
of a still-unknown disease...

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.196
...that has so far taken the life of
a school nurse and three students.

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:54.855
Other schools in District 281
will remain open...

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:59.129
...but parents have been notified to
keep home any children with symptoms.

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:01.704
The Department of Health
is awaiting confirmation...

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:05.309
but sources say these new cases may
be connected to the sudden death...

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:08.071
of a 34-year-old AIMM
Alderson executive...

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:10.976
...and her 6-year-old son
this holiday weekend.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.678
Hello. I'm Dr. Mears.

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:17.117
I'm an Epidemic Intelligence
Service officer...

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:22.659
...and I'm here from Atlanta to find
out what happened to Beth Emhoff.

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:25.456
Okay, I'm gonna ask you some
questions and see if...

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.962
There was a package she
messengered from Hong Kong.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:32.035
- I opened it with scissors. I'm not sure if...
- No. It shouldn't be an issue.

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:34.035
Virus can't live for
days on a box.

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:35.696
We did Pilates together.

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:38.638
I called her after she got back.
I never heard from her.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.005
- So you had no contact with her?
- No.

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:44.615
- Did she go to the class?
- I didn't see her there.

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.808
We had coffee the day she left.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:50.978
I think she might have moved my cup
because it was on some papers.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:54.284
- I can't remember.
- How many days ago?

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:56.723
About ten days.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:25:01.855
That's okay. The incubation
period is less than that.

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:04.729
Is there anyone else who might
have had contact with her?

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:07.463
- This was everyone.
- Aaron Barnes did.

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.600
Barnes? He worked on
another floor.

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:12.709
There were documents she needed.
He picked her up from the airport.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:16.741
He picked her up from the
airport? Where is he?

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:17.939
Hello?

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.983
- Hello? Mr. Barnes?
- Hello? Yes.

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:24.588
This is Dr. Mears from the
Centers for Disease Control.

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:25.780
- I believe...
- Hi.

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:29.984
Hi. I believe you may have had contact
with Beth Emhoff last week.

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:32.527
Yeah, I picked her up at the
airport. What's this about?

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.959
- And how are you feeling today?
- Pretty cruddy, to be honest.

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:39.467
My head is pounding. I probably
picked up some bug.

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:42.869
- Where are you right now?
- I'm on the bus, heading to work.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.066
- I'd like you to get off immediately.
- What?

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:46.904
- He's on a bus.
- Where?

00:25:47.078 --> 00:25:51.014
Where? Where's the bus, Aaron?

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:53.673
- Lake and Lyndale. What's going on?
- Lake and Lyndale.

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.649
I really need you to
get off that bus.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.880
It's possible you've come in contact
with an infectious disease...

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.491
...and you're highly contagious.
Do you understand?

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.561
I want you to get off now and
stay away from other people.

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:05.753
Now what do I do?

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:08.331
Don't talk to anyone,
don't touch anyone.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.400
That's the most important thing.

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:13.561
- We'll send somebody to meet the bus.
- Okay.

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:16.206
I'm on my way to
you now, Aaron.

00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:23.611
What about my kids?
I touched them.

00:26:56.848 --> 00:27:00.807
It was a groundbreaking ceremony
for a new factory.

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:03.887
She traveled a lot for work.

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.615
Did her work involve contact
with livestock in any way?

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:09.555
- Did you keep any pets at home?
- No.

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.228
No.

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:16.332
Did she mention seeing
anyone who was sick?

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:19.166
Anyone on a plane?

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:21.805
No.

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:27.209
She went through customs
in Chicago at 11:15 AM...

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:31.406
...and then took a flight
to Minneapolis at 6 PM.

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:34.279
Any idea what she did in Chicago
during that layover?

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:35.476
Did she have meetings?

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:40.751
Is there any reason she might
have left the airport?

00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:47.364
Why? I mean, is there
someone sick in Chicago?

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:57.639
Before we were married my
wife had a relationship...

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:00.744
...with a man in Chicago
named Jon Neal.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.843
Is Jon Neal sick?

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.112
Did we get this from him?

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:15.620
- We're investigating all the possibilities.
- No. I think I have a right to know.

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:18.456
Look at where I am here.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.964
- I can't disclose that information. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm just... trying to understand.

00:28:23.134 --> 00:28:24.226
I know.

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.393
We're getting the same
results as Sussman.

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.903
We've sequenced the virus,
determined its origin...

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:32.532
...and we've modeled the way it enters
the cells of the lung and the brain.

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.941
The virus contains both
bat and pig sequences.

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:37.911
The dark green is pig and
the light green is bat.

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:40.108
And here you can see
the crossover event.

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:43.777
Bat, bat, and pig, bat.

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:47.755
And here is a model of the virus
and how it attaches to its host.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:52.920
The blue is virus, and the gold is human and
the red is the viral attachment protein...

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:55.692
...and the green is its receptor
in the human cells.

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:59.769
These receptors are found in the cells
of both the respiratory tract...

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.530
...and the central nervous system.

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:07.508
And the virus attaches to the cell
like a key slipping into a lock.

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:10.978
Somewhere in the world, the wrong
pig met up with the wrong bat.

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:15.552
- You ever seen anything like this before?
- No. And it's still changing.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.245
It's figuring us out faster
than we're figuring it out.

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:20.653
It doesn't have anything
else to do.

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:23.794
So we have a novel virus with a
mortality rate in the low 20s...

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:26.692
...no treatment protocol and
no vaccine at this time.

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.560
That is correct.

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:35.329
From here on out, I want no one
working on this except at BSL-4.

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:40.103
Last thing we need is for this to walk out of
the lab on the bottom of someone's shoe.

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:54.348
Dr. Sussman's office.

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.721
Lan, hi. Ally Hextall.

00:29:56.895 --> 00:30:00.353
We need to shut you down.
This thing's too hot.

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:04.525
- BSL-4 only at this point.
- I think that's a mistake.

00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:08.565
Cook your samples.
Destroy everything.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.907
- We can't risk it.
- We're making progress.

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:15.910
You limit this to government-run
BSL-4s, it'll take forever.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.604
I can do this.

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.010
I'm sorry.

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:24.177
Yeah.

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:25.879
Sure, Ally.

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:34.324
Can you repeat the affected
cities so far?

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.126
Again, the affected cities are...

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:41.295
...Minneapolis, Chicago, Los
Angeles, Boston and Salt Lake.

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:44.202
We expect that list to grow...

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.673
...as people return home
from their holidays.

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:48.107
Yes?

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.747
Dr. Cheever, how many
people are infected...

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.109
...and how many have died?

00:30:52.283 --> 00:30:54.945
Those numbers are changing
as we speak...

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:57.587
...so any figure I give
you is likely to be low.

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.315
We're still calculating the
mortality rate at this time.

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:03.120
Dr. Cheever, are
you concerned...

00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:05.592
that the CDC faces a
credibility issue here...

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:08.630
...after the perceived
overreaction to H1N1?

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.961
I'd rather the story be
that we overreacted...

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:14.366
...than that many people lost their
lives because we didn't do enough.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.733
That's why we're here.

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:21.004
It's also why the World Health Organization
is sending an epidemiologist to Hong Kong.

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:23.579
Hard to know what it is
without where it came from.

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:26.876
Our first job with these things
is to find ground zero.

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:29.485
Figure out how it jumped
into the population.

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:32.885
We do know that a
patient in Minnesota...

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:35.025
...traveled to that
part of the world.

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:49.563
We believe that there are approximately
89,000 cases at this point...

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:54.162
...and that we are heading
toward 267,000.

00:32:54.939 --> 00:33:00.309
And from there, using our model,
based on an R-nought of two...

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:03.606
...here is where we expect
to be in 48 hours.

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:07.217
Dr. Cheever, perhaps you can
update us on the research.

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:11.482
As of right now, no one has found a
good way to grow the virus in cells.

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.283
Why is that?

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:17.519
Because it kills every cell we put
it in. A pig, a chicken, everything.

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:21.256
Until we can grow it and a great deal
of it, we can't experiment with it.

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.559
And until then, we can't
vaccinate against it.

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:29.139
Have you found any treatment at
all? Any antivirus? Anything?

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.164
No.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:36.610
Beth Emhoff used an ATM
at a casino in Macao.

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:38.749
Citibank released her records.

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:44.513
We have her using the machine at
10:43 just off the casino floor.

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:49.353
I wanna see the casino security footage
for two hours on either side of that.

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.486
Is there a problem?

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:56.155
Oh, they're from my village.
They found a new cluster there.

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:02.169
- Is your family still there?
- My mother has symptoms.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.571
I'll get you the footage
you require. Excuse me.

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:51.445
Dr. Sussman, I heard that
they were shutting us down.

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.817
Yeah, I just have to deal
with the samples.

00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:56.482
If it's just a matter of
destroying them, I can do it.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.561
No, I'll take care of it.
You go on home.

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:01.562
I'll do that and then I just
want to recheck some data.

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:34.321
He grew it.

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:36.933
He tried antibodies and
immunological MAC outlines...

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.695
...but the key was a fetal-bat
cell line from Geelong.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:42.465
- We didn't have it.
- He grew it in a BSL-3.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.404
Ally, what the hell was he doing
working with it in a BSL-3?

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.838
Ignoring me.

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:52.916
He's gonna publish. Shit.
What does he want?

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:55.382
A box of cigars. He had
a choice, Ellis.

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:57.646
He could have gone into
business for himself.

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.723
There's no doubt he was approached,
but he gave it to us.

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:04.293
- And we're supposed to trust him?
- We don't have a choice.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.124
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in the United States...

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.427
and the World Health
Organization in Switzerland...

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:14.162
confirmed today that Dr. Lan
Sussman of San Francisco...

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:18.399
...has succeeded in growing the MEV-1
virus in a laboratory setting.

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:22.444
Officials at the CDC cautioned that the
breakthrough is only the first step...

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:24.240
toward developing a vaccine...

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:27.350
...which is likely still months
away from human trials.

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:32.251
The WHO estimates the number of people
infected worldwide to be over 8 million.

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.891
Now it all changes.

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:38.261
Sussman gets anointed by the
National Academy of Sciences...

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:41.330
...and every pharmaceutical
executive gets a hard-on.

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.831
They'll be growing the virus
in every lab on Earth.

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.561
It's a bad day to
be a rhesus monkey.

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:51.800
Crikey, first we shoot them into space.
Now we'll be shooting them full of virus.

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.841
So this is where we
need your expertise.

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:56.343
Pharmaceutical stocks are
already through the roof.

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:59.881
What's next? Where's
the opportunity?

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.611
Now, you saw that Shinko
bus thing day one.

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:04.812
That's why we wanted
this meeting.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.581
When I turned on my
computer this morning...

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:12.252
...I had over two million unique
visitors, all looking for the truth.

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:16.525
You think they wanna see me talking
to some hedge-fund guy?

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.898
Mr. Krumwiede, we don't
invent need here.

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:24.007
We just analyze it, predict it.

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:28.002
You tell me what it costs to
look into your crystal ball.

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:33.450
You're familiar with forsythia?

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:36.579
- No, I'm not.
- What I'm about to tell you is backed up...

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.382
...by testimonials that will
appear shortly in the media.

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:43.118
I'll be talking about it extensively
in the days ahead.

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:45.888
What does forsythia do?

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.659
It's the cure.

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:52.360
If I'm immune, can't you use
my blood to cure this?

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:55.869
Blood serums can take a long time
to make, and are very expensive.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.532
But the good news here is that
you're not going to get sick.

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:02.806
Okay...

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.778
Then that would mean that my daughter
can't get it either, right?

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.180
I can't promise you that.

00:38:08.352 --> 00:38:11.549
But isn't that something that
she would inherit from me?

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:14.213
Well, half her immune
system came from you...

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:17.122
...but the other half
came from her mother.

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:25.626
Almost three hours.

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.964
I need to see a doctor or
a supervisor or something.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.869
I wanna know if he has
this thing on the news.

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:34.034
I'm sorry sir, we're
doing the best we can.

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.736
Can I just speak to an administrator
or something? Anybody.

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:38.848
Sir, please be patient.
We'll get you in...

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:40.347
He's sick!

00:38:41.218 --> 00:38:43.652
My wife makes me take off
my clothes in the garage.

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:46.756
Then she leaves out a bucket
of warm water and some soap.

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:51.020
And then she douses everything in
hand sanitizer after I leave.

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:53.493
I mean, she's overreacting, right?

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:57.532
Not really. And stop touching
your face, Dave.

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.275
Okay, we'll put the
air lock here.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:10.904
I want 25 rows of 10 beds apiece.
The most febrile cases at this end.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:15.314
We'll set up triage outside, FEMA
can handle food in the basement...

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:19.513
...and we'll need to be operational
within the next 24 to 48 hours.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.157
Gotcha.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:25.585
- Nice job, Dave. This will work.
- Thanks.

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.196
Now find me three
more just like it.

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:32.696
Excuse me, Dr. Mears. Is this coming
out of your budget or ours?

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.500
WHO has confirmed that
the Hong Kong sample...

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:38.539
matches London, Tokyo
and Abu Dhabi...

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:42.611
...and we're seeing large clusters
in from Frankfurt and Cairo.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.214
Are we any closer to
an index patient?

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.944
Could be your Beth Emhoff or
the guy on the bus in Japan.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.283
Someone else who crawled off
the grid. How you doing?

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.515
Yeah, good. I'm going
into a meeting with...

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:57.684
No, I didn't ask what you were doing,
I asked how you were <i>doing</i>.

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.056
How are you doing?

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.662
I'm...

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.291
I'm fine.

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.231
Fine?

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.065
You know, I was in the
field for 15 years.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:12.141
I've seen a lot of shit. If you're
not doing fine, you can tell me.

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.435
You ever have to tell a man who
just lost his wife and stepson...

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:18.582
...that his wife was cheating
on him before she died?

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.307
No, I haven't.

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:22.452
I'm sure you did the
best you could.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.112
You sound tired.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.281
You gotta try to remember
to sleep once in a while.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.289
When was the last time you had something
that didn't come out of a vending machine?

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.331
Taco Bell.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.027
Local officials are now saying over
3000 cases have been confirmed...

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.535
in the western suburbs...

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:45.197
as well as the first cases reported in
Ramsey, Carlton and Saint Louis counties...

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.809
...as the virus
continues to spread.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:50.374
- Got it!
- A state Health Department spokesperson...

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:53.915
...at this hour is appealing to hospitals
as far away as Iowa for medicine.

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:56.609
No, don't open that door.
Don't open the door.

00:40:56.787 --> 00:41:00.917
- It's Andrew.
- Sorry Andrew, I can't let you in.

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.286
I just came to give my
condolences, Mr. Emhoff.

00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.624
I understand. Thank you.
But I can't let you in.

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.826
I'll just leave them, then.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.128
No, actually, you should take
them. Thank you, though.

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:17.402
- I'll call you later.
- Bye.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.843
We just, you know, aren't
gonna take any chances.

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:41.559
- Do you know how to play this?
- No, I have no idea what's going on.

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:44.764
But it looks fun.

00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:46.994
You wanna try?

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:49.797
Okay.

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.336
We'll see.

00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.479
Hello. Hi.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.136
Oh yeah, my turn, okay.

00:41:57.815 --> 00:42:00.147
This one. Crab. Okay.

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:05.788
Hey.

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:10.126
Oh, my God. I'll do... what
is that? Which one is this?

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:11.761
- Coin.
- It's a coin.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.622
Okay, okay, okay.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.928
It's transmission. So we just
need to know which direction.

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.970
But we don't know
where it comes from.

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:29.773
I would like to suggest that
the virus started before Macao...

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:31.710
...and maybe here in Hong Kong.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.951
You're considering pronouncements
with serious implications.

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:48.994
A virus is too small to
be seen on video camera.

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.754
Please, God.

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.723
Please, God.

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:28.301
No, no, no.

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.483
Hello?

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:50.058
This is Dr. Erin
Mears in Room 821.

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:56.796
I need you to get me the names of everyone
who serviced this room in the last 24 hours.

00:43:56.967 --> 00:44:00.232
Also, you need to get in
touch with the waiter...

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:02.599
...who brought me my room
service last night.

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:07.073
I need all of their numbers.
Home, cell, everything, yes.

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.517
Mears?

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.519
Dr. Cheever...

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.123
...I think I'm sick.

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:25.887
What? What's going on? What
kind of symptoms do you have?

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:29.931
Can't swallow.
Severe headache.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.863
What's your temperature?

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:35.062
- 101.8.
- Listen, you can't... you just...

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:36.866
- You can't panic now, okay?
- I know.

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:40.909
- Are you alone?
- I've definitely infected other people.

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:42.875
You don't know that.

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:47.644
- So, what should I do?
- Well, I want you to stay in your room.

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.378
I'll call the Health Department,
tell them you're there.

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:54.888
- Erin, just... you're gonna be okay.
- No, I know. I know.

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.993
- Okay.
- You gotta send somebody else.

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:59.561
Yes, but you don't worry
about that right now, okay?

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.789
- Hey, I'm...
- You take care of yourself.

00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:03.626
I'm sorry I couldn't finish.

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:07.498
That's... never mind that. Let me see what
I can do about getting you back here.

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:10.765
- I'm gonna get you home if I can, healthy.
- Thank you.

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:13.842
- Now, you hang in there.
- Bye.

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:15.774
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:38.763
The problem is, we just can't
take delivery of the bodies.

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.865
We have insurance issues
with our own employees...

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.703
...with our union, not to mention the
health of the mourners, to consider.

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:51.579
I just, I wanna bury my
wife and my stepson...

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.809
and have a service where our
friends and our family can come...

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:56.782
...and pay their
respects and grieve.

00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:00.848
I understand and I am truly
sorry about your loss.

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:05.059
Have you considered
other options?

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:10.363
How can they do that? We
have a family plot here.

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:13.560
They want us to think
about cremation.

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:17.400
They just say that it's the safest
thing in a situation like this.

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:22.841
I wanna be buried with my
daughter and grandson...

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.310
...with Jack and my parents.

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.346
I want us all together.

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:30.851
They're not gonna take them, Sarah.
They're not gonna take the bodies.

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:34.953
I'll figure something out.

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:44.664
She made mistakes, Mitch...

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:49.534
...but I know she
loved you very much.

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:03.879
I'm gonna use some of these
to get us some drinks, okay?

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.994
You have not reached Jon Neal...

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:18.532
...but you will if
you leave a message.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:23.970
Hi. It's me.

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:30.312
I checked the flights and I can
actually get an earlier flight...

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:36.146
that would give me a five
hour layover in Chicago...

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:41.819
...so let me know if that's something
that you'd like me to do.

00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:48.390
- That's for you, okay?
- Oh, thank you.

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:52.092
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.671
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.771
Thank...

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:06.314
- Emhoff gave it to the Ukrainian.
- That just shows contact.

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:09.350
Maybe it went the other way.
What about Li Fai?

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:12.451
- He was on the casino floor.
- Watch this.

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:21.494
Oh, good. Okay, come on. Let's
get one together. Ready?

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:24.225
Cheers.

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.302
Let's go.

00:48:43.205 --> 00:48:46.436
That's him with
Emhoff at 12:08.

00:48:46.608 --> 00:48:50.271
I can show you the Ukrainian woman on
the security camera in the elevator...

00:48:50.445 --> 00:48:53.141
...going back to her room
twenty minutes earlier.

00:48:53.315 --> 00:48:55.977
She was gone before
Li Fai started work.

00:48:56.718 --> 00:48:58.743
It came from here.

00:48:59.321 --> 00:49:00.618
Emhoff is the index patient.

00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:03.553
We need to know everywhere
she went before the casino.

00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:06.859
I want to see her
itinerary again.

00:49:07.663 --> 00:49:10.598
They say the French and
Americans have a cure.

00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:13.098
They're manufacturing
it in secret.

00:49:13.268 --> 00:49:16.237
WHO knows but they're in
bed with the Americans.

00:49:16.405 --> 00:49:19.431
- Who says?
- The Internet.

00:49:19.608 --> 00:49:24.045
- The Internet? And you believe it?
- I don't know.

00:49:25.514 --> 00:49:26.845
How's your mother?

00:49:29.685 --> 00:49:33.177
We tried forsythia but
she wasn't strong.

00:49:33.355 --> 00:49:36.085
There's a mass grave in Lan Tau.

00:49:38.026 --> 00:49:39.755
I'm sorry.

00:49:43.398 --> 00:49:48.097
I'm taking this to the ministry.
We need to send this to Geneva.

00:50:42.491 --> 00:50:44.584
I need you to come with me.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.352
- What are you doing?
- Please.

00:50:46.528 --> 00:50:47.893
No.

00:50:48.063 --> 00:50:49.460
What's going on, Sun Feng?
694b

00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:51.760
What's going on?
What are you doing?

00:51:08.417 --> 00:51:11.875
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

00:51:12.053 --> 00:51:14.283
We couldn't wait any longer.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:32.565
While they cure each
other, we're here...

00:51:33.308 --> 00:51:35.469
...at the end of the line.

00:51:35.644 --> 00:51:38.670
This is what is left
of my village.

00:51:40.215 --> 00:51:43.582
- Are they sick?
- Not yet.

00:51:44.152 --> 00:51:46.382
And we're gonna
keep it that way.

00:51:46.555 --> 00:51:49.718
You'll stay here with us
until they find a cure.

00:51:49.891 --> 00:51:52.086
How is that gonna help?

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.058
You're gonna get us to
the front of the line.

00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:09.243
Dr. Mears.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.745
Dr. Cheever called again.

00:52:14.683 --> 00:52:18.551
We're just having a hard time with
the logistics of evacuating you.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.278
Finding a plane and all.

00:52:21.089 --> 00:52:22.989
I got your phone.

00:52:24.893 --> 00:52:29.057
Dr. Cheever, he asked you to
call if you feel up to it.

00:52:29.731 --> 00:52:31.562
Now, we're setting
up a special ward...

00:52:31.733 --> 00:52:34.759
...for medical personnel and first
responders at the university.

00:52:34.936 --> 00:52:37.029
I wanna move you there...

00:52:37.205 --> 00:52:41.107
but the nurses' union is
calling a work stoppage...

00:52:41.276 --> 00:52:43.005
...until protocols are in place.

00:52:43.178 --> 00:52:47.080
There are volunteers
but it's just...

00:52:47.716 --> 00:52:52.278
It's hard right now to know
where's the right place.

00:52:52.454 --> 00:52:55.252
You're asking me to spend a lot
of resources on one person...

00:52:55.423 --> 00:52:57.118
...and right now,
I can't do that.

00:52:57.292 --> 00:52:58.691
Dr. Mears would agree with me.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.124
She's one of our own, Lyle.
We sent her up there.

00:53:01.296 --> 00:53:03.992
Okay, I sent her up there.
I would like to go get her back.

00:53:04.165 --> 00:53:06.030
We have a plane with
an isolation pod...

00:53:06.201 --> 00:53:09.261
...to bring our people in the field
home when they're sick, right?

00:53:12.207 --> 00:53:14.334
What's going on, Lyle?

00:53:15.477 --> 00:53:19.277
There's a sick congressman
from Illinois in D.C.

00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:23.076
He was in Chicago
over the holiday.

00:53:23.652 --> 00:53:25.517
They're using the pod
to fly him home.

00:53:25.687 --> 00:53:28.315
Then they're closing down
Midway and O'Hare.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:31.926
The governor is calling the National
Guard. They're setting up roadblocks.

00:53:32.093 --> 00:53:34.618
They're shutting down trade,
public transportation.

00:53:34.796 --> 00:53:36.923
The Teamsters are pulling
drivers off the road.

00:53:37.098 --> 00:53:39.589
- People are still gonna slip through.
- Yes, they will.

00:53:39.768 --> 00:53:42.794
The Secret Service is moving
the president underground.

00:53:42.971 --> 00:53:46.737
Congress is figuring out
how to work online.

00:53:46.908 --> 00:53:48.739
When the word goes out...

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.971
...there will be a run on the banks, gas
stations, grocery stores, you name it.

00:53:53.148 --> 00:53:56.015
People will panic. The virus will
be the least of our worries.

00:53:56.184 --> 00:53:57.446
It will tip over now.

00:53:57.719 --> 00:54:02.520
We just need to make sure that nobody
knows until everybody knows.

00:54:02.691 --> 00:54:04.386
My temperature's 101.

00:54:06.127 --> 00:54:08.425
Higher than it was earlier.

00:54:09.731 --> 00:54:11.631
My head hurts...

00:54:12.601 --> 00:54:15.263
...and my throat feels
like it's closing.

00:54:16.338 --> 00:54:18.363
This is forsythia.

00:54:18.873 --> 00:54:24.869
I've been taking it since
the onset of the symptoms.

00:54:37.926 --> 00:54:41.953
If I'm here tomorrow,
you'll know it works.

00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:46.995
Truth Serum Now.
I'm Alan Krumwiede.

00:54:48.837 --> 00:54:50.998
How many people
are gonna die?

00:54:51.172 --> 00:54:53.265
Well, in 1918...

00:54:53.441 --> 00:54:56.274
...one percent of the population
died from Spanish flu.

00:54:56.444 --> 00:55:00.039
It was novel, like this, no
one had ever seen it before.

00:55:00.215 --> 00:55:04.311
- One percent of America?
- One percent of the world.

00:55:04.853 --> 00:55:08.118
As many as 70 million people
could die, baby, maybe more.

00:55:10.592 --> 00:55:13.288
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know. We try to figure it out.

00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:15.656
This is why I sent Mears
up there, to Minnesota.

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.422
And now I can't get her back.

00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:20.159
She's sick Aubrey, and I
can't do anything for her...

00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:21.802
...because there are no nurses.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.268
- Why not?
- Because they're on strike.

00:55:24.439 --> 00:55:27.203
- How can they do that?
- Because there's nothing they can do.

00:55:27.375 --> 00:55:29.707
We're putting healthy people
next to sick people...

00:55:29.878 --> 00:55:32.142
...and hoping the healthy
people don't get sick.

00:55:32.313 --> 00:55:36.147
- I'm sorry, Ellis, but that's not your fault.
- I sent her up there, Aubrey.

00:55:36.317 --> 00:55:40.276
If one in four are dying, that means
three out of four are living, right?

00:55:40.455 --> 00:55:42.946
So the odds are in her favor.

00:55:43.491 --> 00:55:46.483
I want you to get in your car and
drive down here to Atlanta now.

00:55:46.661 --> 00:55:48.356
You hear me, Aubrey?

00:55:50.498 --> 00:55:51.760
What are you talking about?

00:55:51.933 --> 00:55:54.458
I want you to get in your
car and leave Chicago.

00:55:54.636 --> 00:55:58.231
I want you to drive here to
Atlanta. Drive by yourself.

00:55:58.406 --> 00:56:02.775
You do it. You do it now. Don't
tell anyone and don't stop.

00:56:02.944 --> 00:56:06.744
Stay away from other people, understand?
Keep your distance from other people.

00:56:06.915 --> 00:56:09.509
Call me when you're
on the road, Aubrey.

00:56:18.493 --> 00:56:20.120
Roger.

00:56:21.896 --> 00:56:22.988
Did you hear?

00:56:23.164 --> 00:56:26.190
I got people too, Dr. Cheever.

00:56:26.367 --> 00:56:28.267
We all do.

00:56:48.089 --> 00:56:49.681
Hello?

00:56:49.858 --> 00:56:53.055
Hey friend, what's up with
blowing off dinner?

00:56:53.228 --> 00:56:57.324
- I'm sorry, Liz.
- Why you so flaky? You feeling okay?

00:56:58.032 --> 00:57:00.159
This flu sh...

00:57:00.335 --> 00:57:04.465
...stuff is really spooky.
What does Ellis say?

00:57:07.275 --> 00:57:10.301
He says it's... serious.

00:57:13.815 --> 00:57:15.840
What do you mean, "serious"?

00:57:16.017 --> 00:57:17.245
Where are you?

00:57:17.418 --> 00:57:19.909
- I'm getting out of town.
- What?

00:57:24.592 --> 00:57:27.220
I'm gonna tell
you something...

00:57:27.395 --> 00:57:29.488
...and you're not
gonna repeat it.

00:58:05.967 --> 00:58:08.595
- Cover your mouth, please.
- Fuck off, lady.

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:12.171
We will only be able to
give out 50 doses today.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.137
- What?
- That's our allotment.

00:58:15.577 --> 00:58:16.805
This is bullshit.

00:58:16.978 --> 00:58:20.072
Hey. There... excuse me, there's
a line here. Excuse me!

00:58:52.747 --> 00:58:54.442
Jesus.

00:58:55.083 --> 00:58:57.449
Where's the fire department?

00:59:14.369 --> 00:59:16.428
Is anyone even working here?

00:59:16.604 --> 00:59:18.663
Just get the cereal.

00:59:23.044 --> 00:59:26.343
- Jory, don't touch anything.
- Help me.

00:59:29.918 --> 00:59:31.647
Okay, take your gloves off.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.247
Here, give me your hands.

00:59:34.422 --> 00:59:36.913
Okay. I want you to
really rub this in.

00:59:39.027 --> 00:59:40.961
Okay, okay, come on.

00:59:44.499 --> 00:59:46.228
Come on, come on.

00:59:47.035 --> 00:59:48.730
Hey, get away from
there. Get away.

00:59:55.643 --> 00:59:57.304
Lock the door.

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:05.477
Get back in your car, sir.
Get back in your car.

01:00:05.653 --> 01:00:07.553
- No, no, I'm not... I'm immune.
- Stay back.

01:00:07.722 --> 01:00:08.848
I've already had it.

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.116
- And my daughter's not sick.
- She's sick?

01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:14.056
She's not, no. We're just
trying to get to Wisconsin.

01:00:14.228 --> 01:00:17.061
The border is sealed. The governor
has declared a quarantine.

01:00:17.231 --> 01:00:18.255
Get back in your car.

01:00:18.433 --> 01:00:20.867
No, we don't wanna go back
there. We wanna go across.

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:23.833
- There is no way across. Get in your car.
- We're not sick.

01:00:24.005 --> 01:00:27.168
Get back in your car
or I will detain you.

01:00:27.342 --> 01:00:29.003
Where?

01:00:29.177 --> 01:00:30.542
Get in the car!

01:00:42.857 --> 01:00:45.724
- What happened?
- We have to go home.

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:09.683
What are you doing here?

01:01:11.786 --> 01:01:14.550
I think I had a seizure.

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:21.528
I can't... find any in
the stores. I tried.

01:01:21.696 --> 01:01:25.792
Look, I don't have any here.
People broke in.

01:01:27.535 --> 01:01:29.366
I'm... pregnant, Alan.

01:01:29.537 --> 01:01:35.635
And I have... money.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:39.576
I can give you some money.

01:01:40.214 --> 01:01:42.808
Lorraine, you shouldn't be out.

01:01:42.984 --> 01:01:44.042
- Please, Alan.
- Go home.

01:01:44.218 --> 01:01:46.982
I'll bring it to
you when I get it.

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:07.638
I was wondering if I could
get another blanket.

01:02:07.809 --> 01:02:09.538
This one's very damp now.

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:12.235
I'm truly sorry, sir.
We're out of blankets.

01:02:12.413 --> 01:02:16.213
We're hoping for more to be
donated. We put the word out.

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:19.512
What about the heat?
Can we turn that up?

01:02:19.687 --> 01:02:21.450
I'll find out.

01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:11.097
- When did we run out of body bags?
- Two days ago.

01:03:11.272 --> 01:03:15.436
We're trying to get more in from Canada
but they just wanna wait and see.

01:03:41.135 --> 01:03:44.070
There are stories on the Internet
that in India and elsewhere...

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:47.867
...the drug ribavirin has been shown
to be effective against this virus.

01:03:48.042 --> 01:03:51.409
Yet Homeland Security is telling the
CDC not to make any announcements...

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:53.843
...until stockpiles of the
drug could be secured.

01:03:54.015 --> 01:03:57.712
Well, Dr. Gupta, there continue to
be evaluations of several drugs.

01:03:57.885 --> 01:03:59.716
Ribavirin is among them.

01:03:59.887 --> 01:04:03.755
But right now, our best defense
has been social distancing.

01:04:03.925 --> 01:04:06.325
No hand-shaking, staying
home when you're sick...

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:08.553
...washing your
hands frequently.

01:04:08.729 --> 01:04:12.426
Can you tell us, to date, how many
people have died from this virus?

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.037
Very difficult. We're still working
on confirming that number.

01:04:17.205 --> 01:04:19.400
There are fifty different
states in this country...

01:04:19.574 --> 01:04:22.270
which means there are fifty
different Health Departments...

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:25.207
...followed by fifty
different protocols.

01:04:25.846 --> 01:04:28.212
Let me bring Alan Krumwiede
into this debate as well.

01:04:28.382 --> 01:04:29.906
Alan's a freelance journalist.

01:04:30.084 --> 01:04:33.144
He was the first to track the
"Shinko Bus Man" video.

01:04:33.321 --> 01:04:34.982
Alan, today on Twitter...

01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:38.819
you wrote that the truth about this
virus is being kept from the world...

01:04:38.993 --> 01:04:41.518
by the CDC, by the World
Health Organization...

01:04:41.696 --> 01:04:44.756
to allow friends of the
administration to benefit from it...

01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:47.196
...both financially
and physically.

01:04:47.368 --> 01:04:52.305
There are therapies we know are
effective right now, like forsythia...

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:54.964
...and they don't even
appear on the CDC website.

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:56.769
On your blog, you also wrote...

01:04:56.944 --> 01:05:00.880
...that the World Health Organization is
in bed with pharmaceutical companies?

01:05:01.048 --> 01:05:02.572
Because they are.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.015
That's who stands to gain from this.
They're working hand in glove.

01:05:06.587 --> 01:05:08.646
And the hand is reaching
into our pockets.

01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:11.986
The CDC is exploring forsythia and
other homeopathic treatments.

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:15.492
But right now, there's no science
to back any of these claims.

01:05:15.663 --> 01:05:20.066
Or no way Dr. Cheever or the people who
put him into power can profit from it.

01:05:20.234 --> 01:05:21.667
We're not ruling anything out.

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:25.203
There are people who are sick, people
who are dying and we are doing...

01:05:25.373 --> 01:05:27.807
They're not keeping us safe
from this any more than...

01:05:27.975 --> 01:05:30.273
We're concerned about
every American citizen.

01:05:30.444 --> 01:05:36.007
Dr. Cheever is being a bit disingenuous
when he says <i>every</i> American citizen.

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:39.641
We're working very hard to find out
where this virus came from, treat it...

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.583
...and vaccinate against it if we can.

01:05:41.756 --> 01:05:43.815
We don't know all of that
yet, we just don't.

01:05:43.991 --> 01:05:46.357
What we do know is that
in order to become sick...

01:05:46.527 --> 01:05:50.395
...you have to first come in contact with
a sick person or something they touched.

01:05:51.232 --> 01:05:54.793
In order to get scared, all you have to
do is come in contact with a rumor...

01:05:54.969 --> 01:05:56.402
...television or the Internet.

01:05:56.570 --> 01:06:01.007
I think what Mr. Krumwiede is spreading
is far more dangerous than the disease.

01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:03.075
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:06:03.244 --> 01:06:04.768
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

01:06:04.945 --> 01:06:07.209
You're funny, because if
you check on Facebook...

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:11.147
you'll find a communiqué attributed to
Dr. Cheever by Elizabeth Nygaard...

01:06:11.319 --> 01:06:15.016
...about the quarantine of Chicago hours
before it was announced to the public.

01:06:15.189 --> 01:06:17.487
That's why I think he's
a bit disingenuous...

01:06:17.658 --> 01:06:20.684
...when he says equal care for
all and not just his friends.

01:06:21.562 --> 01:06:23.928
Some pretty wild allegations
here, Dr. Cheever.

01:06:24.098 --> 01:06:27.033
Can you tell us what communication
appeared and when?

01:06:27.201 --> 01:06:29.635
What is the nature of your
relationship with Nygaard?

01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:32.898
I'm not aware of anything attributed
to me on any social network.

01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:36.737
I'm sure you're not. It is
there. It is there.

01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:40.142
Tell them what an R-nought of
two really means, Dr. Cheever.

01:06:40.314 --> 01:06:42.248
Teach them some math.

01:06:42.817 --> 01:06:44.148
No? I'll do it.

01:06:44.318 --> 01:06:47.947
On day one, there were two people
with it and then there were four.

01:06:48.122 --> 01:06:51.649
And then it was 16, and you think
you've got it in front of you...

01:06:51.826 --> 01:06:54.590
but next it's 256, and
then it's 65,000...

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:57.253
...and it's behind you, above
you and all around you.

01:06:57.431 --> 01:07:00.457
In thirty steps, it's
a billion sick.

01:07:00.634 --> 01:07:03.330
Three months. It's a math problem
you can do on a napkin.

01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:05.495
And that's where we're headed.

01:07:05.673 --> 01:07:08.733
And that's why you won't even tell
us the number of the dead...

01:07:08.909 --> 01:07:10.103
...will you, Dr. Cheever?

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:12.939
But you'll tell your friends
when to get out of Chicago...

01:07:13.114 --> 01:07:15.674
...before anyone
else has a chance.

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:20.614
They're looking
for a scapegoat.

01:07:20.788 --> 01:07:23.154
You just made it easy.

01:07:25.025 --> 01:07:28.119
The only reason we're not taking
this to the attorney general...

01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:30.354
...is because we can't
replace you right now.

01:07:30.531 --> 01:07:33.830
But there's gonna be an investigation.
Do you understand that?

01:07:38.272 --> 01:07:41.332
And we don't wanna see you in
front of the cameras anymore.

01:07:52.953 --> 01:07:56.047
Where did you come from?

01:07:58.793 --> 01:08:01.523
- It's mutated.
- Which way, better or worse?

01:08:01.695 --> 01:08:04.721
It's moved into an African
HIV/AIDS population.

01:08:04.899 --> 01:08:07.891
The Durban cluster is
highly divergent.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:13.303
We have a new R-nought, Ellis.
It's not two anymore.

01:08:31.192 --> 01:08:34.525
I thought you said once we could grow
it, we could vaccinate against it.

01:08:34.695 --> 01:08:38.825
We tried using dead virus combined with
atrophins to boost immune response.

01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:40.023
And?

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:42.795
No protective antibodies,
a lot of dead monkeys.

01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:46.701
- Can you get to the good news?
- Now we have to try a live attenuated virus.

01:08:46.941 --> 01:08:48.431
- Like with polio?
- Exactly.

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:50.304
The only danger with a live virus...

01:08:50.478 --> 01:08:53.914
...is the possibility that it will
revert to wild type and kill the host.

01:08:54.081 --> 01:08:56.413
And when will we
know about that?

01:08:57.218 --> 01:08:58.879
I'll ask the monkeys.

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:01.851
As of right now, the mortality
rate is fluctuating...

01:09:02.022 --> 01:09:04.684
between 25 and 30 percent...

01:09:04.859 --> 01:09:07.623
depending upon underlying
medical conditions...

01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:11.287
...socioeconomic factors,
nutrition, fresh water.

01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:13.057
With the new mutation...

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:17.637
...we are predicting an R-nought
of no less than four.

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:20.330
And without a vaccine,
we can anticipate...

01:09:20.508 --> 01:09:27.107
...that approximately one in 12 people
on the planet will contract the disease.

01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:41.712
Folks, attention.

01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:45.757
We appreciate your patience and
we're doing the best we can.

01:10:45.926 --> 01:10:49.487
We have exhausted our supply of
meals ready-to-eat for today.

01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:51.028
What?

01:10:51.198 --> 01:10:52.688
Please remain calm.
We'll be sending...

01:10:52.866 --> 01:10:55.494
Please... Hey. Can we get
some help over here?

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:58.599
Leave the park in an
orderly fashion.

01:10:58.772 --> 01:11:00.239
Help me!

01:11:04.778 --> 01:11:06.245
- You okay?
- Thank you.

01:11:06.413 --> 01:11:09.177
- Sorry, they got one of them.
- Get the trucks!

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:11.813
Get the trucks!

01:11:28.202 --> 01:11:31.330
There's... nothing in there!

01:11:32.272 --> 01:11:35.207
As the death toll in the United
States is now believed...

01:11:35.376 --> 01:11:36.707
to have reached 2.5 million...

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:40.244
the president issued a statement today
from an undisclosed location...

01:11:40.414 --> 01:11:43.747
implementing mandatory curfews
in major metropolitan areas...

01:11:43.917 --> 01:11:47.785
...after a second consecutive day of riots
in Dallas, Miami, Cleveland and Phoenix.

01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:50.947
Absenteeism in law enforcement
is nearing 25 percent.

01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:21.317
Because of the high
volume of 911 calls...

01:12:21.488 --> 01:12:23.422
...please use the
following directory:

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:29.859
If you have symptoms, please
hang up and call 612-188-6336.

01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:34.057
To report a death or for the removal
of a body, please press 1.

01:12:45.145 --> 01:12:47.170
Hello? Anybody home?

01:12:50.284 --> 01:12:51.945
Hey, Mark?

01:13:24.451 --> 01:13:26.043
Hey, Jor?

01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:33.082
Jor?

01:14:03.524 --> 01:14:05.822
I can't feel my hands.

01:14:09.329 --> 01:14:11.763
That messed up my snow angel.

01:14:13.033 --> 01:14:14.193
I'm fine, Jory.

01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:17.667
If neither of us have it, then
we can't give it to each other.

01:14:23.143 --> 01:14:24.508
- Get away from her.
- Dad!

01:14:24.678 --> 01:14:26.771
- Get away. Get away.
- Dad!

01:14:26.947 --> 01:14:29.415
- What are you doing?
- Stay there.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:31.744
Go home, Andrew.

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:41.751
Get up.

01:14:50.204 --> 01:14:52.434
Are we even close?

01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:56.398
If we even had a viable
vaccine right now...

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:59.774
...we would still have to do human
trials, and that would take weeks.

01:14:59.947 --> 01:15:02.541
And then we would have to
get clearance and approval...

01:15:02.716 --> 01:15:04.581
...figure out manufacturing
and distribution.

01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:06.116
That would take months.

01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:08.550
And then training survivors
to give inoculations.

01:15:08.722 --> 01:15:11.213
More months, more deaths.

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:13.623
Well, Homeland Security
wants to know...

01:15:13.794 --> 01:15:17.696
...if we can put a vaccination in
the water supply, like fluoride.

01:15:17.865 --> 01:15:19.662
Cure everyone all at once.

01:15:21.501 --> 01:15:24.902
I'm going home now, Ellis.
It's getting late.

01:15:25.072 --> 01:15:26.505
Merry Christmas.

01:15:30.978 --> 01:15:32.912
Merry Christmas.

01:17:02.803 --> 01:17:04.703
- What are you doing?
- It's okay, Dad.

01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:09.035
- No, it's not okay.
- Do you remember Dr. Barry Marshall?

01:17:09.209 --> 01:17:13.543
Thought that bacteria caused
ulcers, not stress.

01:17:13.714 --> 01:17:15.807
Gave himself the bug and
then cured himself.

01:17:15.983 --> 01:17:18.144
You taught me about him.

01:17:19.619 --> 01:17:22.281
I'm testing my vaccine.

01:17:23.223 --> 01:17:25.350
No, this is different.

01:17:25.525 --> 01:17:27.891
I don't want to
get you sick.

01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:29.585
Ally, you can't
take that chance.

01:17:29.997 --> 01:17:34.093
Dad, you're here because you
stayed in your practice...

01:17:34.267 --> 01:17:36.963
...treating sick people after
everyone else went home.

01:17:37.137 --> 01:17:40.903
You took that chance. You took
that chance every day.

01:17:51.218 --> 01:17:52.845
What?

01:17:55.288 --> 01:17:57.256
He won a Nobel Prize.

01:17:57.424 --> 01:18:00.951
- Yes, I know, Dad.
- Barry Marshall.

01:18:10.837 --> 01:18:13.704
The Food and Drug Administration
is accelerating approval...

01:18:13.874 --> 01:18:15.739
of the MEV-1 vaccine...

01:18:15.909 --> 01:18:19.845
currently in production at five secret
locations in the U.S. And Europe...

01:18:20.013 --> 01:18:24.677
...saying the first doses could be
available for human use within 90 days.

01:18:24.851 --> 01:18:27.376
The WHO estimates that it
could take nearly a year...

01:18:27.554 --> 01:18:30.887
to manufacture and distribute the
necessary amount of the vaccine...

01:18:31.058 --> 01:18:33.026
to stop the spread of the virus...

01:18:33.193 --> 01:18:37.152
...which so far has taken over
26 million lives worldwide.

01:18:41.334 --> 01:18:44.633
Who gets it first?

01:18:55.749 --> 01:18:57.649
- Don't touch me.
- Where is it?

01:18:57.951 --> 01:19:00.852
- We don't have it.
- Bullshit. He works there. He gets it first.

01:19:01.021 --> 01:19:02.989
We don't have it.
We have to wait...

01:19:32.052 --> 01:19:34.020
- Aubrey?
- Ellis?

01:19:34.187 --> 01:19:35.882
Where are you?

01:19:36.523 --> 01:19:40.084
It's because they saw you on the news
and they heard about what happened.

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.251
- You all right?
- They knew where you worked.

01:19:42.429 --> 01:19:43.953
They waited for you to leave.

01:19:45.732 --> 01:19:49.532
- Get up here. Come on. Let me look at you.
- I tried to stop them.

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:51.500
I tried.

01:19:52.105 --> 01:19:56.838
- Did they touch you? Did they look sick?
- They had masks on, Ellis, and gloves.

01:19:57.010 --> 01:20:01.106
Don't tell me that... Aubrey,
we get the vaccine tomorrow.

01:20:01.281 --> 01:20:04.045
You have to trust me, Ellis.

01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:06.412
They didn't touch me.

01:20:07.087 --> 01:20:10.784
After the Spanish flu in 1918,
you know, people got rich.

01:20:10.957 --> 01:20:14.654
The Vicks VapoRub people, the
Lysol people, look it up.

01:20:14.828 --> 01:20:18.389
One man dies, another man
makes money off his coffin.

01:20:18.565 --> 01:20:21.864
One country culls all their chickens,
red meat goes into higher demand.

01:20:22.035 --> 01:20:23.935
I'm not the first person
to make money...

01:20:24.104 --> 01:20:27.699
...off the fact that our immune
system is a work in progress.

01:20:27.874 --> 01:20:30.866
The pharmaceutical industry
do it every quarter.

01:20:31.044 --> 01:20:33.808
I don't think anyone is immune
to opportunity, Alan.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.313
It's just that studies show that there
is no proof that forsythia works.

01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:39.076
Who conducted the studies?

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:42.653
What defines "works"? Against
what strain of the virus?

01:20:42.822 --> 01:20:45.450
Did you know about the studies
when we met the last time?

01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:47.092
We can get in a
lot of trouble...

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:51.321
Do you really think this Dr. Hextall
CDC person is Jesus in a lab coat?

01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:53.625
The government rushed the trials.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.860
The lawyers indemnified
the drug companies.

01:20:57.037 --> 01:21:01.974
Maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy
or cancer ten years from now.

01:21:02.142 --> 01:21:04.474
Who knows?

01:21:04.644 --> 01:21:05.941
You... the...

01:21:06.112 --> 01:21:10.105
...the swine flu vaccine
killed people back in 1976.

01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:11.307
Nerve disease.

01:21:11.484 --> 01:21:14.078
So we're all guinea pigs,
starting from today.

01:21:14.254 --> 01:21:19.590
Just wait, they'll start listing side effects
like the credits at the end of a movie.

01:21:19.759 --> 01:21:23.195
People trust you, Alan. If you
tell them not to take it...

01:21:23.363 --> 01:21:25.160
That's right.

01:21:25.332 --> 01:21:28.995
They trust me. All twelve
million unique visitors.

01:21:29.169 --> 01:21:31.433
I'm a trusted man stepping
up to a microphone...

01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:34.506
...in front of a
very large crowd.

01:21:34.674 --> 01:21:37.700
That's who I am.
That's the brand.

01:21:37.877 --> 01:21:40.368
I say the right thing, nobody
shows up for their shot.

01:21:40.547 --> 01:21:42.811
Maybe they'd rather roll
the dice with forsythia.

01:21:44.351 --> 01:21:45.716
I can make that happen.

01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:49.013
I just wanna know I'm in the best
position possible when I do.

01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:51.316
What does that mean, exactly?

01:21:52.592 --> 01:21:55.959
If I'm gonna step into the crosshairs,
I wanna know what's in...

01:21:59.332 --> 01:22:01.323
- Is he with you?
- What? Who?

01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:03.526
Are you wearing a wire?

01:22:05.472 --> 01:22:08.999
Alan, I didn't have a choice.
They've seen your blog.

01:22:09.576 --> 01:22:10.668
Get him.

01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:19.050
- Far enough, far enough.
- For what? Tell me, for what?

01:22:19.219 --> 01:22:22.848
Securities fraud, conspiracy,
and most likely manslaughter.

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:26.049
- It cured me. Forsythia cured me.
- We'll see, Alan.

01:22:26.626 --> 01:22:28.560
This is entrapment.

01:22:28.728 --> 01:22:32.960
You can't take my blood. You
can't, that's my property.

01:22:40.173 --> 01:22:43.836
We may never know where
this disease came from.

01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:46.774
But we do know that this
vaccine is the result...

01:22:46.946 --> 01:22:51.747
...of the courage and perseverance
of a remarkable few.

01:22:52.919 --> 01:22:57.049
We shall now begin
the drawing. John.

01:23:00.427 --> 01:23:03.794
The first MEV-1 vaccination...

01:23:03.963 --> 01:23:07.922
...are those people
born on March 10th.

01:23:08.101 --> 01:23:09.125
March 10th.

01:23:09.302 --> 01:23:14.103
We remind all of you to stay ten
feet apart from each other...

01:23:14.274 --> 01:23:16.208
...while on line.

01:23:25.318 --> 01:23:26.580
Shouldn't you be downstairs?

01:23:26.753 --> 01:23:29.187
I'm tracking vaccine
batch numbers.

01:23:29.356 --> 01:23:31.756
This is what you have to be
doing right this minute?

01:23:31.925 --> 01:23:34.826
This is what I want to do
right this minute.

01:23:36.496 --> 01:23:38.293
Take a bow, Ally.

01:23:38.465 --> 01:23:39.830
People have for a lot less.

01:23:39.999 --> 01:23:42.661
It's not that hard to give
yourself an injection.

01:23:42.836 --> 01:23:47.068
What about Mears or
my father or you?

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.108
I'm gonna take a bow while you
get hauled in front of Congress?

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:54.212
What do I say when
they ask about that?

01:23:55.014 --> 01:23:57.812
You tell them that I told a loved
one who told a loved one...

01:23:57.984 --> 01:23:59.281
...and that I'd do it again.

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:03.013
Without you... Ally, you have
saved millions of lives.

01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:05.453
That's a great story. It also
happens to be true.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.286
Now, how often can
you say that?

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:13.395
The next citizens to receive
the MEV-1 vaccination...

01:24:13.566 --> 01:24:16.399
are those born on the date...

01:24:17.003 --> 01:24:19.471
What is that? January 11th.

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:23.973
Okay. All right, 144.

01:24:24.677 --> 01:24:27.475
That's... there's
still two-hundred...

01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:30.946
More than two-hundred birthdays hon, that
haven't been called, so that's good.

01:24:31.117 --> 01:24:32.584
That's a good number.

01:24:33.119 --> 01:24:35.519
- What if they run out?
- They're not gonna run out.

01:24:35.688 --> 01:24:38.919
They have enough to keep up with
demand. They said that already.

01:24:39.092 --> 01:24:42.220
Maybe I'm immune like you
and I don't even need it.

01:24:42.395 --> 01:24:45.125
That's not a chance
we're gonna take.

01:24:45.298 --> 01:24:49.291
So instead we lose spring,
we lose summer...

01:24:49.469 --> 01:24:53.235
...we lose another 144 days
that don't happen again.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.737
Why can't they invent a shot
that keeps time from passing?

01:24:58.344 --> 01:25:01.541
It's gonna start getting
normal again, Jory.

01:25:39.853 --> 01:25:44.187
How do you call this,
"fish" in Chinese?

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:46.816
This is yú.

01:25:48.962 --> 01:25:52.090
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:25:52.265 --> 01:25:55.962
It's time. We have to
run. He just landed.

01:25:56.569 --> 01:25:59.037
I want you to keep drawing...

01:25:59.205 --> 01:26:03.642
...and Assand will come and
finish the class, all right?

01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:05.368
I'll see you soon.

01:26:05.545 --> 01:26:07.945
- See you.
- See you.

01:26:18.358 --> 01:26:21.452
Tsuen Wan Cemetery off
the Number 3 Expressway.

01:26:21.628 --> 01:26:25.064
It's close to where you
are now. In 15 minutes.

01:26:25.231 --> 01:26:29.327
One hundred doses. Nobody from
the ministry, no police.

01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:34.201
If we see anybody else, any other
vehicles, you'll never see her again.

01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:38.934
Yes?

01:26:39.812 --> 01:26:43.145
Yes, I'm fine. Please give
them what they ask.

01:26:43.316 --> 01:26:45.409
I just wanna go home.

01:26:47.387 --> 01:26:51.551
Once we have the vaccine, we'll
tell you where to find her.

01:27:39.172 --> 01:27:42.801
- Is it French or American?
- We could not get enough from the French.

01:27:42.976 --> 01:27:45.672
It's been made here. The
same formula, though.

01:27:46.579 --> 01:27:49.104
It is effective, I promise.

01:27:49.983 --> 01:27:51.507
There, be careful.

01:28:02.428 --> 01:28:04.623
Wait, where is she?

01:28:10.203 --> 01:28:14.037
- We don't know what it is.
- Well, we have no choice.

01:28:16.242 --> 01:28:17.436
Where is Dr. Orantes?

01:28:31.691 --> 01:28:34.353
Now, wait, this is not
what we agreed on.

01:28:43.469 --> 01:28:45.198
Are you okay?

01:28:48.708 --> 01:28:50.767
Yes, I'm fine.

01:28:50.943 --> 01:28:52.638
I'm good.

01:29:09.929 --> 01:29:12.056
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:29:15.735 --> 01:29:17.794
- What's that?
- Your vaccine.

01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:20.564
The one you took was a placebo.

01:29:21.207 --> 01:29:22.640
What?

01:29:23.743 --> 01:29:27.679
The Chinese insisted. There have been
many abductions, not just here.

01:29:27.847 --> 01:29:29.678
In Russia, Mexico, all over.

01:29:29.849 --> 01:29:34.411
Government officials, scientists
or Westerners with great wealth.

01:29:34.587 --> 01:29:37.522
Mostly perpetrated by organized
crime or revolutionary groups...

01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:39.123
...trying to extort medicines.

01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:42.625
The Chinese don't negotiate with
kidnappers. It wasn't up to us.

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:45.958
We've got a limited supply,
just like everyone else.

01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:48.225
Leo... Leonora.

01:29:48.701 --> 01:29:50.635
Where are you going?

01:30:22.135 --> 01:30:25.161
Blood results came
back, Mr. Krumwiede.

01:30:25.338 --> 01:30:30.275
You never had the virus. You
have no antibodies. You lied.

01:30:30.443 --> 01:30:32.934
Of course that's
what your labs say.

01:30:33.112 --> 01:30:35.342
Forsythia is a lie.

01:30:35.515 --> 01:30:38.712
It's a lie and you made $4.5
million for telling it.

01:30:38.885 --> 01:30:40.750
You wanna blog about that?

01:30:42.822 --> 01:30:47.282
You are going to go away, Mr. Krumwiede,
and so is all your money.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:51.021
I can't even imagine all the civil suits
people are gonna file against you...

01:30:51.197 --> 01:30:53.062
...and I have a pretty
good imagination.

01:30:53.232 --> 01:30:55.496
Now you wanna tell people
not to get vaccinated...

01:30:55.668 --> 01:30:58.102
...when that's the best
chance they've got.

01:30:59.105 --> 01:31:01.335
If I could throw your computer
in jail, I would.

01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:07.269
Made bail.

01:31:12.218 --> 01:31:14.152
Are we done here?

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.312
Evidently, there are 12 million
other people as crazy as you are.

01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:19.651
You made bail. Congratulations.

01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:34.299
Cheever and wife. Congratulate
Aubrey for me.

01:31:34.473 --> 01:31:37.965
I'd shake your hand but I don't
wanna set a bad example.

01:31:38.244 --> 01:31:42.578
We're gonna have an official reception
when we can get everybody in one place...

01:31:42.748 --> 01:31:44.943
...and we really hope
you can be with us.

01:31:45.117 --> 01:31:48.052
Sure. So are you ready for
yours? I've got mine.

01:31:48.221 --> 01:31:51.019
No, I think she's gonna
wanna do these together.

01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:54.387
I know she sprang
for some champagne.

01:31:55.494 --> 01:32:00.898
They have scheduled the hearings.
We'll both be expected to testify.

01:32:01.067 --> 01:32:02.534
Right.

01:32:03.836 --> 01:32:05.360
Good luck.

01:32:28.194 --> 01:32:30.162
Head back, Anthony.

01:32:32.598 --> 01:32:33.622
There you go.

01:32:40.606 --> 01:32:41.698
Good job.

01:32:41.874 --> 01:32:47.335
I can't give him the bracelet but
at least you know he'll be safe.

01:32:47.513 --> 01:32:50.607
Yeah, beats waiting
another seven months.

01:32:52.451 --> 01:32:54.316
Okay, what do you say?

01:32:56.489 --> 01:32:59.356
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Anthony.

01:32:59.525 --> 01:33:01.891
You know where this comes
from, shaking hands?

01:33:02.061 --> 01:33:03.085
No.

01:33:03.262 --> 01:33:07.631
It was a way of showing a stranger you
weren't carrying a weapon in the old days.

01:33:08.401 --> 01:33:12.132
- Good job. Now go finish your homework.
- Okay.

01:33:13.272 --> 01:33:14.796
Yeah.

01:33:14.974 --> 01:33:18.671
You offered your empty right hand
to show that you meant no harm.

01:33:18.844 --> 01:33:22.439
- I didn't know that.
- I wonder if the virus does.

01:33:23.082 --> 01:33:26.677
Well, Dr. Cheever, thanks.

01:33:30.756 --> 01:33:32.587
Take care, Roger.

01:33:32.758 --> 01:33:34.419
You too.

01:33:51.777 --> 01:33:54.109
You're not gonna get in
trouble for this, are you?

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.872
Will you be quiet?

01:33:56.048 --> 01:33:58.516
My number is 287, Ellis.

01:33:58.684 --> 01:34:01.312
If we weren't married, I'd
have to wait almost a year.

01:34:01.487 --> 01:34:03.580
Then it's a good thing
we're married.

01:34:03.856 --> 01:34:04.880
Hold your head back.

01:34:05.057 --> 01:34:07.582
I don't wanna give them another
reason to go after you.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.490
Will you please be quiet
and hold your head back?

01:34:12.932 --> 01:34:13.956
Okay, go.

01:34:15.334 --> 01:34:16.858
Good.

01:34:17.803 --> 01:34:20.795
And go.

01:34:20.973 --> 01:34:21.997
Good.

01:34:24.143 --> 01:34:25.770
All right.

01:34:27.146 --> 01:34:29.171
Like you said, baby...

01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:34.510
...just taking care of everybody
that's in my lifeboat.

01:38:47.673 --> 01:38:50.403
Dad, are you coming?

01:38:51.744 --> 01:38:53.177
Yep.

01:38:56.415 --> 01:38:59.213
I'm just looking
for the camera.
