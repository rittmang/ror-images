00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.161
<i>Ms. Kaiser,
you seem to have traveled a long way</i>

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.896
<i>from an idealistic intern
in Barack Obama's campaign</i>

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.483
<i>to working for an organization
that keeps pretty unsavory company.</i>

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.291
<i>Didn't that make you uncomfortable at all?</i>

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.789
<i>You referred to having two sets
of business cards.</i>

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:23.083
<i>Who did you work for?</i>

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.745
Don't take this the wrong way.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.646
In your life, have you ever worked for

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.567
or provided information
to any country's intelligence agency?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.458
Hi. A small coffee, please?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.418
- Uh, $2.25.
- Great.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.717
All right.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:21.224
Who has seen an advertisement

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.476
that has convinced you

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.480
that your microphone is listening
to your conversations?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.654
It's hard for us to imagine
how else it could work,

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:38.950
but what's happening
is that your behavior

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.119
is being accurately predicted.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:45.957
So, the ads that seem uncannily accurate,

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.668
that have to be eavesdropping on us,

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.796
are more likely to be evidence

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.756
that the targeting works,

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:55.967
and that it predicts our behavior.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:00.930
Maybe it's because I grew up
with the Internet as a reality.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.267
The ads don't bother me all that much.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.895
When does it turn sour?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.581
<i>This is a Brooklyn-bound Q express train.</i>

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.043
<i>The next stop is Canal Street.</i>

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.924
<i>It began with the dream
of a connected world.</i>

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.930
<i>A space where everyone could share
each other's experiences</i>

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.973
<i>and feel less alone.</i>

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.604
<i>It wasn't long before this world
became our matchmaker,</i>

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.068
<i>instant fact-checker,
personal entertainer,</i>

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.863
<i>guardian of our memories,
even our therapist.</i>

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.827
<i>I was teaching digital media
and developing apps.</i>

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.831
<i>So, I knew that the data
from our online activity</i>

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.333
<i>wasn't just evaporating.</i>

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.546
<i>And as I dug deeper, I realized...</i>

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.843
<i>these digital traces of ourselves</i>

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:25.556
<i>are being mined
into a trillion-dollar-a-year industry.</i>

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.646
<i>We are now the commodity.</i>

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.191
<i>But we were so in love</i>

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.111
<i>with the gift of this free connectivity...</i>

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:42.490
<i>that no one bothered to read
the terms and conditions.</i>

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.215
<i>All of my interactions,</i>

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:03.052
<i>my credit card swipes, web searches,</i>

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.763
<i>locations, my likes,</i>

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.687
<i>they're all collected in real time
and attached to my identity,</i>

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.817
<i>giving any buyer direct access
to my emotional pulse.</i>

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.950
<i>Armed with this knowledge,
they compete for my attention,</i>

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:33.624
<i>feeding me a steady stream of content
built for and seen only by me.</i>

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.132
<i>And this is true
for each and every one of us.</i>

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.886
<i>What I like,</i>

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.764
<i>what I fear,</i>

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.224
<i>what gets my attention,</i>

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:55.813
<i>what my boundaries are,
and what it takes to cross them.</i>

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:01.527
<i>Go back to Washington.</i>

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.946
<i>Crooked Hillary tells lots of lies.</i>

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.699
<i>The stock market's gonna crash.
I mean, this'll cause a civil war.</i>

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:11.204
<i>We saw the fallout
of our filtered realities</i>

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.497
<i>in the 2016 election.</i>

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.980
<i>...you were not offended
when Donald Trump said it!</i>

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.423
<i>Get the f*** out!</i>

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.386
<i>The real world became
a deeply divided wreckage site.</i>

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.518
<i>Fuck those dirty beaners! Build the wall!</i>

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.060
<i>Whoo!</i>

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.106
<i>Fight!</i>

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:42.610
<i>How did the dream
of the connected world tear us apart?</i>

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.801
My daughter is eight, and my son is four.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:13.683
Uh, every app is carefully scrutinized
before ins... being installed, and...

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.895
And, like, now, I'm the dad
who reads the privacy policy and says,

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:22.275
"No, you see here?
They read your messages.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.027
Are you okay with that?"

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:31.242
That's, like, the new way
I'm gonna be an annoying parent.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.788
Hey.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.499
I've been concerned for a long time

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:42.545
about how the misuse
of our data and information

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.589
could affect my children's future.

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:50.386
But it wasn't until
after the 2016 election that I realized

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.805
it had already happened on our watch.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.643
It was really, like, a feeling of, like...

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.314
...the worst-case scenario has happened
with technology.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.109
Hmm.

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:07.653
I became obsessed with finding answers.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.782
And the question I kept asking myself was:

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:14.785
Who was feeding us fear?

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.412
And how?

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:25.671
<i>This was our Project Alamo,
where the digital arm</i>

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.007
of the Trump campaign operation was held.

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:32.011
When Project Alamo was at its peak,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:35.681
they were spending
one million dollars a day

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.184
on Facebook ads.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.188
We had the Facebook,
and YouTube, and Google people.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.065
They would kind of congregate here.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.235
I mean, they were basically
our hands-on partners

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:50.279
as far as, you know,
being able to utilize the platform

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.073
as effectively as possible.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.783
But what we also learned

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.244
is that a company
called Cambridge Analytica...

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.708
was also working on Project Alamo.

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:06.045
Cambridge Analytica was here.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.840
And this is kind of the brain of... of,
you know, the data.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.677
- <i>This was the data center.
- Right.</i>

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.405
"We gotta target this state.
We gotta target that state."

00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.491
- So, within that...
- How would they know that?

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.195
- How would they know that...
- That's... That's their secret sauce.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.445
- <i>Paul-Olivier?
- I'm there.</i>

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.740
<i>Okay. Let me just, uh, set up my screen.</i>

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.787
I connected with a mathematician
based out of Switzerland

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.539
named Paul-Olivier Dehaye.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:45.334
<i>I've been looking
at Cambridge Analytica for over a year</i>

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:48.087
<i>and I think there's more to be found.</i>

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.591
Both Paul and I understood that

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.510
in order to send people
personalized messages,

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.886
you need people's data.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:02.143
And Cambridge Analytica
claimed to have 5,000 data points

00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:04.186
on every American voter.

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:08.983
But it was invisible.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:15.239
And so the question is,
how do you make the invisible visible?

00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:21.746
That's the hardest part. Um...

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.710
Paul-Olivier Dehaye had

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.919
a hypothesis,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.882
and the hypothesis was that US voter data

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:36.218
was processed
by Cambridge Analytica's parent company

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.553
in Great Britain.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.436
And if it was true,

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:49.273
I could use a British lawyer
to force Cambridge Analytica

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.650
to give me my data.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.657
I think the beauty of David's case
is it encapsulates

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.828
why data rights should be considered
just fundamental rights, simple rights.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.705
Because all he wants to know

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:06.540
is what did you do?

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:12.213
And if David finds out
the data beneath his profile,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.883
you'll start to be able
to connect the dots in various ways

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:20.054
with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica
and Trump and Brexit

00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:23.891
and all these loosely-connected entities.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.519
Because you get to see inside the beast,

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.604
you get to see inside the system.

00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:42.576
I used to be the COO and CFO

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.496
of the Cambridge Analytica, or SCL, Group.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.167
If you spoke to most people
that worked at Cambridge Analytica,

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.128
they would say the same thing.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.715
It was, uh...
an environment of great innovation.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.927
Hello, my name is Alexander Nix.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.804
I'm CEO of Cambridge Analytica,

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:05.182
the world's leading
data-driven communications company.

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:08.394
From Mad Men of old to Math Men of today,

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:10.479
expert data scientists whose insight

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.399
can tell you far more about audiences
that you want to reach

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:14.900
and how to reach them.

00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:23.033
Alexander Nix was very focused
on building a strong elections business.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:28.247
And then the Obama campaign
very successfully used data

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:31.000
and digital communications,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.587
which created a market opportunity
to provide a service

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.756
to Republican politics in the US.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.762
God bless the great state of Iowa.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:47.641
Ted Cruz went
from the lowest rated candidate

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.934
in the primaries

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:54.064
to being the last man standing
before Trump got the nomination.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:57.234
Let me first of all say...

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.864
to God be the glory.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.513
Everyone said Ted Cruz had
this amazing ground game,

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:10.790
and now we know
who came up with all of it.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.126
Joining me now, Alexander Nix,
CEO of Cambridge Analytica,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.419
the company behind it all.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:18.464
It's fascinating, Alexander,
to look at all of the work

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:20.007
that goes into the ground game.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.051
Have any of the other candidates
called you?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.969
Well, um...

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.942
It's my privilege to speak to you today

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:41.737
about the power of big data
and psychographics.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.950
When Cambridge Analytica
joined the Trump campaign,

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.118
we were an attractive proposition.

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:52.331
We'd just spent 14 months
working on the Ted Cruz campaign,

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:56.669
and had collected a huge amount
of voter data and research,

00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:59.338
which we were able to hand over
to the Trump team.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:04.510
By having hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of Americans

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:05.593
undertake this survey,

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.515
we were able to form a model,

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:12.977
where we have somewhere close
to four or five thousand data points

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.981
we can use to predict the personality
of every adult in the United States.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.192
Because it's personality
that drives behavior,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.362
and behavior that obviously influences
how you vote.

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.615
We could then start to target people

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.451
with highly-targeted
digital video content.

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:33.539
Secretary Clinton said there was
nothing marked classified on her emails

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:35.541
either sent or received. Was that true?

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.837
<i>Our movement is about replacing</i>

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.049
<i>a failed
and corrupt political establishment.</i>

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.886
Why aren't I 50 points ahead,
you might ask?

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.513
<i>Do you really need to ask?</i>

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.445
A night that will go down in history,

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:07.698
a stunning upset as Donald Trump
triumphs over Hillary Clinton,

00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:11.368
defying the polls, the pundits,
and the political class once again,

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:14.163
this time elected president
of the United States.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.308
USA! USA!

00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:36.435
Thank you.

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.437
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:50.032
If there's one singular takeaway
from this event,

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.952
that is that these sorts
of technologies

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.662
can make a huge difference

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:58.248
and will continue to do so
for many years to come.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.084
Thank you.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:10.302
After the election,
it was really exciting.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.516
We could see the path
to being a billion-dollar company.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.937
We were on top of the world.
Or at least we thought we were.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.707
This is the exciting box.

00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:47.548
I've been investigating
Cambridge Analytica

00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:54.888
and how that ties to the Brexit campaign
to leave the European Union.

00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.103
And this has been my full-time,
12-hours-a-day,

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:05.649
seven-days-a-week kind of obsession,
I would say, since then.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:07.901
It's been all-consuming.

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:15.492
When I first started looking
into this whole web of links

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.954
between Cambridge Analytica and Brexit...

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.416
I emailed Andy Wigmore,

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:26.754
who is an associate of Nigel Farage.

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:32.634
And Nigel Farage is a very central figure
in the Brexit campaign.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.680
I sort of said,
"Oh, can we go for a coffee?

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.851
I'm really interested in technology
and campaigning."

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:45.272
And then he just sort of like,
he just like laid it all out.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.280
It was just after the Inauguration.

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:57.034
So, Andy, he was just like sort of, like,
showing me all the photos on his phone.

00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:58.869
"This is the inauguration."

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.414
Then, "Oh, it's such a laugh!

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:04.583
We had such a good time. Oh, Donald..."

00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:09.588
And I was like, "How did the introduction
to Cambridge Analytica come out?"

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:14.301
He was like, "You know, it's 'cause Nigel.
Nigel's friends with Steve Bannon."

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.805
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Bannon!

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:22.101
Steve Bannon headed
the campaign for Trump.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:26.772
He's also the Vice President
of Cambridge Analytica.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.068
So he's like, "Yeah, there's this bunch
of billionaires in the States.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.445
We've all got the same aims,

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:38.283
and Brexit was the petri dish for Trump."

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:41.411
For most of my life,
America is the leader.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:44.998
Now, I would like to think,
in my own little way,

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:47.292
that what we did with Brexit

00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:51.380
was the beginning
of what is gonna turn out to be

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.674
a global revolution

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:56.176
and that Trump's victory
is a part of that.

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:05.644
Anyway, and then he told me
all sorts of other stuff

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:08.605
about, you know, how they used
artificial intelligence,

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:12.651
you know,
how they were mining details from Facebook

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:14.278
and, um...

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:18.115
And he was like... And he was like,
"It's creepy, Carole!" He said,

00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:20.450
"The amount of information
you can get on people...

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:22.369
People just give it to you!"

00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:24.132
And he sort of said,
"It's just so creepy!"

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:28.041
So, I just kind of kept going.

00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:31.044
The Brexit work.

00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:37.134
I'd started tracking down all these
Cambridge Analytica ex-employees.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.892
And, eventually, I got one guy
who was prepared to talk to me.

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:47.519
Chris Wylie.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.735
We had this first telephone call,
which was insane.

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.654
It was about eight hours long. And...

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:08.373
My name is Christopher Wylie,
I'm a data scientist

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.500
and I helped set up Cambridge Analytica.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:15.297
It's incorrect to call Cambridge Analytica

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.551
a purely sort of data science company
or an algorithm, you know, company.

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:22.930
You know, it is a full-service
propaganda machine.

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:29.561
You were an investor
in Cambridge Analytica.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:32.624
- I helped put the company together.
- And... Yes, you did. And...

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:34.733
And gave it...
And gave it that amazing name.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.111
Steve Bannon was the editor of <i>Breitbart.</i>

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:42.366
He follows this idea
of the <i>Breitbart</i> doctrine,

00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:46.370
which is that, if you want
to fundamentally change society,

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.121
you first have to break it.

00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:49.915
And it's only when you break it

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:54.711
is when you can remold the pieces
into your vision of a new society.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.925
This was the weapon

00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:03.178
that Steve Bannon wanted to build
to fight his culture war.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.847
And we could build them for him.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.393
But I needed to figure out a way
of getting data,

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:12.938
and so I went
to these Cambridge University profs

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:14.606
and asked, "What do you think?"

00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:33.750
Kogan offered us apps on Facebook
that were given special permission

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:39.756
to harvest data not from just the person
who used the app or joined the app,

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:45.053
but also it would then go
into their entire friend network

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:48.724
and pull out
all of the friends' data as well.

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:53.061
If you were a friend of somebody
who used the app,

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.148
you would have no idea
that I just pulled all of your data.

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:03.780
We took things like status updates, likes,

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:06.116
in some cases, private messages.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.954
We wouldn't just be targeting you
as a voter,

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.333
we'd be targeting you as a personality.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.672
We would only need to touch
a couple hundred thousand people

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.342
to build a psychological profile

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:28.013
of each voter in all of the United States.

00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:33.244
And people had no idea

00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:35.354
that their data was being taken
in this way?

00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:37.314
No.

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.363
You didn't ever stop and think,

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:47.866
"Actually, this is people's
personal information,

00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:52.579
and we're taking it, and we're using it
in ways that they don't understand"?

00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:54.288
No.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:23:00.670
Throughout history, you have examples
of grossly unethical experiments.

00:23:01.129 --> 00:23:02.631
Is that what this was?

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:07.636
I think that, yes,
it was a grossly unethical experiment.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.182
You are playing with the psychology
of an entire country

00:23:12.265 --> 00:23:14.434
without their consent or awareness.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.729
And not only are you, like,

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:20.190
playing with the psychology
of an entire nation,

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:22.377
you're playing with the psychology
of an entire nation

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.111
in the context of the democratic process.

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:33.578
The revelations have started to spill out.

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:40.460
We're now not just threatening
to do things, but we're actually doing it.

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.590
- Okay, we're ready, guys.
- One, two, three...

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:48.093
We turn now to the burgeoning scandal

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:51.054
around voter-profiling company
Cambridge Analytica.

00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:54.724
David Carroll filed a legal challenge
in Britain

00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:57.352
asking the court
to force Cambridge Analytica

00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.564
to turn over all the data it harvested
on him.

00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:02.816
Explain what you are demanding.

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.402
Uh, full disclosure, so...

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.780
where did they get our data,

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:12.284
how did they process it,
who did they share it with,

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:14.828
and do we have a right to opt out?

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.331
Cambridge Analytica says

00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:19.541
it's got 5,000 data points

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.668
on many, many millions
of people out there.

00:24:21.751 --> 00:24:22.836
That's right.

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:26.298
When people can actually see
the extent of the surveillance,

00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:28.633
I think they're going to be shocked.

00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:33.430
We don't work with Facebook data.
We don't have Facebook data.

00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:36.766
Uh, we do use Facebook
as a platform, uh, to advertise.

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:38.351
Mr. Nix, <i>Channel 4 News.</i>

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.687
Did you mislead Parliament
over the Facebook issue?

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.315
Absolutely not.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:47.736
It's crazy that I have to mount
a year-long,

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:51.865
super risky legal challenge
in another country

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.159
to get my voter profile.

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:57.537
David, don't stop, don't relent.

00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:00.957
- Keep going. Good.
- I'm gonna do it, don't worry.

00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:02.876
Don't sleep!

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.423
Facebook's down 6.35%.

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:10.717
That's 120 billion dollars.

00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:12.219
This is huge.

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:17.265
<i>Officers working
for the UK Information Commissioner</i>

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:20.727
<i>are searching the headquarters
of Cambridge Analytica, in London.</i>

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.872
<i>They're inside,
they're looking at computers,</i>

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.523
<i>they're looking for documents.</i>

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:29.486
<i>Facebook knew about
that data collection over two years ago</i>

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:32.572
<i>but did not go public
until three days ago.</i>

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.407
Really, Facebook?

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:36.326
You forgot to mention
that 50 million people

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:37.595
had their private data breached,

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.455
but every time it's my uncle's friend's
sister's dog's birthday,

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.873
I get a notification?

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:50.298
<i>You are taking on a giant,</i>

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.425
<i>a Goliath of big data marketing.</i>

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:55.262
<i>How hopeful are you of succeeding?</i>

00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:04.688
People don't want to admit
that propaganda works.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.859
Because to admit it means confronting
our own susceptibilities,

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:12.320
horrific lack of privacy,

00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:14.281
and hopeless dependency

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.742
on tech platforms ruining our democracies

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:19.619
on various attack surfaces.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.248
Join the struggle
to help get our data back.

00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:41.891
Welcome to our inquiry
into disinformation and fake news.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:45.520
I'd like to welcome Christopher Wylie
and Paul-Olivier Dehaye,

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:48.231
uh, to the committee
to give evidence this morning.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.276
Have you or anybody else made
any assessment

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:53.296
of actually whether any of this
made much difference

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.364
to the final outcome of the EU Referendum?

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:03.580
When... When you're caught
in the Olympics doping, right,

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:08.668
there's not a debate about how much
illegal drug you took. Right?

00:27:08.752 --> 00:27:10.045
Or, "Well,

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.808
he probably would've come in first
anyway,"

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.758
or, you know,
"He only took half of the amount," or...

00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:17.719
Doesn't matter. If you're caught cheating,
you lose your medal. Right?

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:18.928
Because...

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:23.308
...if we allow cheating
in our democratic process,

00:27:23.683 --> 00:27:24.600
what about next time?

00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:28.146
What about the time after that?
Right? You shouldn't win by cheating.

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:33.026
A lot of people will say,
and I'll say, um,

00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:36.464
that given that you're someone
who worked very closely with these people,

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.656
uh, for a period of time,

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.325
why have you decided to speak out
against it

00:27:40.408 --> 00:27:42.928
and give evidence against people
who used to be your colleagues?

00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:46.623
It's a process of coming to terms
with what you've created

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:49.751
and the impact
that that... that... that has had.

00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:53.963
Um, I am incredibly remorseful
for my... my role in setting it up.

00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:59.094
But there's been a lot of attention on me
because I'm sort of... I've become the...

00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:02.347
uh, you know, the face of it,
because I'm the one that's...

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.557
come forward and put my name to it.

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.363
But someone else
that you should be calling

00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:07.894
to the committee is Brittany Kaiser.

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:09.813
Who's Brittany Kaiser?

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:32.085
I'm not that interested in standing up
for powerful white men anymore

00:28:32.168 --> 00:28:35.505
who obviously don't have
everybody's best interests at heart.

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.469
<i>Brittany Kaiser,
once a key player</i>

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.513
<i>inside Cambridge Analytica,</i>

00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:45.765
<i>casting herself as a whistle-blower.</i>

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:49.269
<i>Until three weeks ago,
Brittany Kaiser, a top exec there,</i>

00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:52.981
<i>she had a key to Steve Bannon's townhouse
in Washington.</i>

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:56.151
<i>She spoke at CPAC in 2016,
along with Kellyanne Conway,</i>

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.653
<i>spent election night
at the Trump victory party</i>

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.364
<i>with mega-donor Rebekah Mercer.</i>

00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.743
<i>Miss Kaiser was also closely involved</i>

00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:07.537
<i>with millionaire Brexit supporter
Arron Banks</i>

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.706
<i>and his Leave. EU campaign.</i>

00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:20.067
<i>She's raising some interesting things.</i>

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.444
<i>Why is she talking now, do you think?</i>

00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:23.470
<i>Well, she only gave us
part of the picture.</i>

00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:27.056
<i>She's talking to investigators,
and so we'll know the full picture</i>

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.475
<i>at some point later...</i>

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.666
I have evidence

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:58.171
that the Brexit campaigns
and the Trump campaign

00:29:58.254 --> 00:30:00.423
could've been conducted illegally.

00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:07.514
And so, for my own safety,
I don't need geolocation of where this is.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.474
Just me sitting here...

00:30:11.434 --> 00:30:13.937
the person trying to overthrow
two administrations

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.856
and all of the most powerful companies
in the world,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.858
all at once.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:25.240
With one disjointed
but hopefully-soon-seamless narrative.

00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:31.204
The wealthiest companies
are technology companies.

00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:34.999
Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.710
And the reason why these companies

00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:40.547
are the most powerful companies
in the world

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.343
is because, last year, data surpassed oil
in its value.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:48.388
Data is the most valuable asset on Earth.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.517
And these companies are valuable

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.271
because they have been exploiting
people's assets.

00:30:57.939 --> 00:31:00.817
It wasn't until one of my friends
reached out to me

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.945
to ask was I going to be all right

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:07.740
with the way that my story would be seen
in history.

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.452
And I thought, "No.

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.414
I'm not okay, actually."

00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:18.042
And there's probably a lot of information
that I could give

00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:22.171
that would be helpful
to making things okay, possibly.

00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.611
I'm a political technologist

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:47.989
who tries to shine a big light

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.408
on how data's been used and abused.

00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:55.038
It's a moment where people have
that visceral sense.

00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:56.748
There is, you know,

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.918
that there's something wrong here,
uh, that we need to fix.

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:05.506
And so, I've dropped
pretty much everything I was doing

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.967
to work on this with Brittany Kaiser.

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:13.306
I went and found her and met her,

00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:15.642
and she was very forthcoming

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:20.063
in a way which made me think,
"There's a lot here."

00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:30.657
What we really need to be understanding
is people's levers of persuasion.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.118
How are we actually going to message
voters so that they can under...

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:37.497
<i>Tina and I met with Brittany Kaiser.</i>

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.249
<i>We look very unlike
any other political</i>

00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:42.001
<i>and communications firm, so...</i>

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:44.045
<i>Do you work both sides of the aisle?</i>

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.523
<i>Uh, no, we only work for the Republicans
in the United States.</i>

00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:47.547
<i>Okay.</i>

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:49.676
<i>And in Britain?</i>

00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:53.304
<i>Well, actually, right now
we're working on the Brexit campaign.</i>

00:32:54.555 --> 00:32:57.767
At Leave. EU, we're going
to be running a large-scale research

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.103
throughout the nation to really understand

00:33:00.186 --> 00:33:03.481
why people are interested in staying in
or out of the EU.

00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:07.652
And the answers to that will help inform
our policy and our communications,

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:10.321
to make sure that we turn out
more first-time voters,

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:14.200
more unregistered voters,
more apathetic voters than ever before.

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:33.928
I think we now have
the foundations laid for...

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:38.057
her to share what is
some reasonably explosive materials

00:33:38.224 --> 00:33:39.642
that we've been finding.

00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:46.024
Uh, and, uh...
her inbox and her hard drive,

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:50.945
uh, really are a treasure trove
of... uh, sketchy information.

00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:56.075
And we're still
just scratching the surface.

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:24.520
Tell us about the first meeting
you had in Trump Tower.

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:27.065
In November 2015,

00:34:27.148 --> 00:34:32.153
I went with Alexander Nix
to go see Corey Lewandowski,

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.238
who was the campaign manager at the time.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:38.951
And I asked Corey, why could this place
possibly look so familiar?

00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:42.413
And he said,
"This is the set of <i>The Apprentice.</i>

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:45.041
That's probably why you recognize it."
And...

00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:47.376
I was kind of shocked, you know?

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:52.048
The Trump campaign HQ is a reality TV set.

00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.883
Yes. It is.

00:34:57.762 --> 00:35:00.765
And the idea of a company...

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:04.143
conducting large-scale analysis
of a population...

00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:05.227
Mm-hmm.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:08.564
...and then identifying the triggers
that people have

00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:12.068
in terms of what's gonna move them
from one state to another state,

00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:15.113
that feels very challenging

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:18.324
to the individual's sense of autonomy
and freedom...

00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:19.492
- Mm-hmm.
- ...uh...

00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:22.203
and to the idea of democracy.

00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:23.704
Doesn't it?

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:28.000
I don't know. Um...
I would challenge that.

00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:31.420
What this strategy is mostly meant to do

00:35:31.504 --> 00:35:34.590
is to identify people
who are still considering

00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:36.384
- many different options...
- Yes.

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:41.264
...and educate them
on some of the options that are out there,

00:35:41.347 --> 00:35:42.765
and if they're on the fence,

00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:45.893
then they can be persuaded
to go one way or the other.

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.855
- Yes, they can.
- Uh, again, that is their own choice.

00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:50.398
- But a lot of the times...
- Is it?

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:53.201
- ...these are individuals that...
- Is it their own choice?

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.689
In the end, they're the ones
that go to the ballot box

00:35:56.737 --> 00:35:58.990
- and make their ch... decision.
- Yeah.

00:35:59.365 --> 00:36:02.368
I mean, I'm asking you these questions
as Brittany Kaiser.

00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:03.536
- I know.
- Right?

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:07.248
I'm not asking you these questions
as Cambridge Analytica or SCL,

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:10.334
because that's not
who you are anymore. Right?

00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:12.545
I get it. I get it. But...

00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:14.748
And do you think Cambridge Analytica

00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:17.925
was ever involved in the contravention
of people's human rights?

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.010
No.

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:25.766
But, again, I start to question
a lot of things the more I hear.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.800
Yeah.

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:29.770
I mean,
I had spent my entire career before that

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.939
working for human rights.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.900
Okay.

00:36:35.318 --> 00:36:37.111
Let's go back to that.

00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:41.407
It wasn't that long ago. Just a decade.

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:45.077
- It wasn't that long ago.
- Yeah.

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:54.170
<i>I had worked in elections
since I was 14 or 15.</i>

00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:59.842
<i>I told my cousin I applied
to intern on the Obama campaign.</i>

00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:01.302
<i>She was like, "Oh, my God.</i>

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:03.721
<i>You better get that internship,
or I'll die."</i>

00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:07.767
<i>I was part of the team
running Obama's Facebook.</i>

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:14.065
<i>We invented the way social media is used
to communicate with voters.</i>

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.990
<i>I then spent several years
working on human rights</i>

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.742
<i>and international relations,</i>

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.328
<i>first for Amnesty International,</i>

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:31.123
<i>then lobbying at the United Nations
and European Parliament.</i>

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.214
<i>And I used to always say
I love human rights campaigning,</i>

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:41.968
<i>but sometimes I feel like
I'm banging my head against a brick wall</i>

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:44.387
<i>because I can't see the results
of what I'm doing.</i>

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.889
<i>I don't know
if I'm literally just wasting my time.</i>

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:52.144
<i>And that's where I was
when I met Alexander Nix.</i>

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:59.487
<i>Friends of ours thought
it would be a good joke to introduce us.</i>

00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:04.240
<i>He was very interested in learning more
about my experience with the Democrats.</i>

00:38:04.573 --> 00:38:06.367
<i>He gave me his card and said,</i>

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.161
<i>"Let me get you drunk
and steal your secrets."</i>

00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:16.294
<i>And in December 2014,
he offered me a job.</i>

00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:24.927
<i>Coming across a company
where you could actually see your impact</i>

00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:27.346
<i>was really exciting for me.</i>

00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:36.564
<i>I got a little more conservative or posh</i>

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:41.110
<i>in terms of the way that I dressed
and the way that I spoke,</i>

00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:46.532
<i>and doing things
like going on shooting at the weekends</i>

00:38:46.615 --> 00:38:47.992
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:52.538
<i>It's just very different to what
I would normally spend my time doing.</i>

00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:01.881
Must've been a hell of an adventure.

00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:05.343
It was really interesting.
I strapped on my cowboy boots,

00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:08.554
got into character,
got my NRA membership.

00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:11.140
- Yeah, you joined the NRA, right?
- I did, yeah.

00:39:11.223 --> 00:39:13.059
Just to understand
how these people think,

00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:14.142
- like...
- Uh-huh.

00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:15.686
I don't want to use guns.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.356
- I'm not really interested in guns at all.
- Yeah.

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:20.316
I felt like I was getting to know...

00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:24.236
people that I used to disagree with a lot,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.281
like my grandparents, my aunts,
uncles, cousins.

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:32.620
So this wasn't just an outfit
that you put on, and it felt important?

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.498
It was important. It is important.

00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:37.833
- Yeah.
- I feel like the main problem

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.210
in US politics

00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:43.130
is that people are so polarized
that they can't understand each other,

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:46.092
and therefore they can't work together,
and therefore nothing gets done.

00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:03.651
I am about to draft some questions
for a senator

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:07.029
who will be able to ask them
to Mark Zuckerberg

00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:10.950
in the Senate Judiciary hearing
on Tuesday.

00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:14.829
"How much of Facebook's revenue

00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:19.375
comes directly from the monetization

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.045
of users' personal data?"

00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:26.590
All of it!

00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:29.552
Exactly.

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.013
The reality is that Facebook knows more
about this

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.974
than pretty much anyone in the world

00:40:35.057 --> 00:40:39.937
because Facebook is the best platform
on which to run experiments.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.939
Yeah, it is. Um, it...

00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:44.525
And it actually always gets you
the best engagement rates.

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:46.735
We always spend the majority
amount of money

00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:49.613
on any commercial
or political campaign in Facebook.

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:51.866
Always gets the majority of the ad budget.

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.617
- It does, it does.
- Yep.

00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:58.956
There is at least the possibility
that the American public

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.876
and publics in other countries
have been experimented on.

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:09.484
<i>Remember those Facebook quizzes
that we used</i>

00:41:09.508 --> 00:41:12.678
<i>to form personality models
for all voters in the US?</i>

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:19.351
<i>The truth is, we didn't target
every American voter equally.</i>

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:22.396
<i>The bulk of our resources</i>

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.108
<i>went into targeting those
whose minds we thought we could change.</i>

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.028
<i>We called them "the persuadables."</i>

00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:32.907
<i>They're everywhere in the country,</i>

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.619
<i>but the persuadables that mattered
were the ones in swing states</i>

00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:40.873
<i>like Michigan, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, and Florida.</i>

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:47.922
<i>Now, each of these states were broken down
by precinct.</i>

00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:53.093
<i>So, you can say
there are 22,000 persuadable voters</i>

00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:54.845
<i>in this precinct,</i>

00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:59.725
<i>and if we target enough persuadable people
in the right precincts,</i>

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:03.479
<i>then those states would turn red
instead of blue.</i>

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.942
<i>Our creative team designed
personalized content</i>

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.693
<i>to trigger those individuals.</i>

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:12.029
<i>Terrorists love porous borders.</i>

00:42:12.112 --> 00:42:15.324
<i>Widespread gaps
in border security allow terrorists...</i>

00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:19.745
<i>We bombarded them through blogs,
websites, articles, videos, ads,</i>

00:42:19.828 --> 00:42:21.664
<i>every platform you can imagine.</i>

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:24.959
<i>Until they saw the world
the way we wanted them to.</i>

00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:31.590
<i>Until they voted
for our candidate.</i>

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:35.010
<i>It's like a boomerang.</i>

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:37.137
<i>You send your data out,</i>

00:42:38.138 --> 00:42:39.807
<i>it gets analyzed,</i>

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:43.727
<i>and it comes back at you
as targeted messaging</i>

00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:46.146
<i>to change your behavior.</i>

00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:05.374
DCMS Committee announced
the future witnesses

00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:07.209
- for a fake news inquiry.
- Yes.

00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:09.712
- There you are. You're...
- Me.

00:43:09.795 --> 00:43:13.090
- You're the day before Alexander.
- The former CEO.

00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:15.634
He's going the day after me.

00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:19.847
Yes. Is it... Is it all feeling a bit real?

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.557
It's really intense.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:23.642
It's real.

00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:26.437
And it's big.

00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:42.578
<i>The first time
I wrote about Cambridge Analytica,</i>

00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.497
<i>it was December 2016.</i>

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.501
<i>I said that they'd worked
for the Trump campaign</i>

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.587
<i>and for the Brexit campaign.</i>

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.305
<i>And I started getting letters
from them saying,</i>

00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:58.218
<i>"We never worked for the Leave campaign."</i>

00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:04.725
<i>And this was baffling
because on Leave. EU's website,</i>

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:07.019
<i>it said, "We hired Cambridge Analytica."</i>

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:11.482
<i>There were statements from Alexander Nix
about how they worked</i>

00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:12.650
<i>for the Leave campaign.</i>

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:17.112
Yeah, I'm afraid we don't talk
about that campaign. At all.

00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.075
You didn't? Or you did?

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.451
No, no, we don't discuss it.

00:44:22.534 --> 00:44:24.134
- Okay. Not at all.
- Yeah.

00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:27.831
And that was when I discovered this video

00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:30.125
of Leave. EU's press launch.

00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:35.798
And I was like, well, there, look,
it's Brittany Kaiser!

00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.425
She works for Cambridge Analytica.

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.552
She's at the press launch

00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:43.389
talking about all the clever things

00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:46.350
that they're going to do with data
for the Leave Campaign.

00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:50.979
Like, what the f***?

00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:54.817
How can you carry on denying it?
This is nuts!

00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:00.539
And it was exactly
the same time

00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:02.408
that Leave. EU started posting

00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:04.243
the horrible videos of me.

00:45:04.326 --> 00:45:05.929
I've gotta get out of here!

00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:08.747
There was a spoof video
of a scene from <i>Airplane!</i>

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:11.434
- Get a hold of yourself!
- Please, let me handle this.

00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:14.604
There was like a whole stream
of people going, "Don't be so hysterical!"

00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:15.628
And, like, hitting her.

00:45:15.671 --> 00:45:17.589
Go back to your seat!
I'll take care of this.

00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:19.717
It was like, "Calm down! Calm down!"

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.278
And, you know, so a whole line of people,

00:45:22.302 --> 00:45:24.638
and then the last person's carrying a gun.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.975
And the whole thing they had,

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:30.936
it was set to the music
from the Russian national anthem.

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.400
Ugh.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.488
The day
after that Leave. EU video was put out,

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:45.701
the editor of another news organization
that I was going to do a report for

00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:47.536
took me for lunch and said,

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:50.579
"Actually, we think it's too much
of a risk having you present the report."

00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:58.046
It is this sort of visceral thing
of living with this disinformation

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.924
and this propaganda every single day.

00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:04.887
And feeling the effects of it
and knowing that it does work,

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.973
it does have an impact in real life,
whether people believe that or not.

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.439
You know,
I'm used to just writing stories.

00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:18.025
You write it, and then you go on
to the next subject.

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:21.445
I'm a feature writer, that's what I did.
But I was just like, "They've lied."

00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:24.168
And they're lying about something
which is actually really massive.

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:26.533
'Cause it's, you know, the...

00:46:27.075 --> 00:46:29.953
rest of the future of our country.

00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:33.749
What do you think, Nigel?

00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:39.755
In the referendum,
most people had very fixed views.

00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:44.218
But there was a tiny sliver of people
who didn't.

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:46.345
These were "the persuadables."

00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:50.057
It was all about finding
these very few people

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.810
and then bombarding them with ads.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.649
This is the thing
which was invisible to all of us.

00:47:00.442 --> 00:47:06.448
Let June the 23rd go down in our history
as our independence day!

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:13.705
<i>The British people have spoken,
and the answer is, "We're out."</i>

00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:15.082
<i>For good or for ill,</i>

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:18.043
<i>this decision will define our politics
for years to come.</i>

00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:22.256
<i>This great country
has made a terrible mistake.</i>

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.174
<i>It's an earthquake that has happened.</i>

00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:27.553
<i>And what happens after earthquakes?
We wait to see.</i>

00:47:27.886 --> 00:47:30.013
<i>People weren't agreed
on what Leave meant.</i>

00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:32.992
- <i>It's simple: leave. Full stop.
- Was no manifesto for Leave.</i>

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.643
<i>But there is no "leave, full stop..."</i>

00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:37.604
Brexit! Brexit! Brexit!

00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:41.995
<i>In the interest of safety,</i>

00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:45.487
<i>parents are advised not to carry children
on baggage trolleys</i>

00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.573
<i>or allow them to play on the escalators.</i>

00:47:47.656 --> 00:47:49.575
- Hi, Mama!
<i>- Hey!</i>

00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:52.744
I'm through, I'm through,
I'm through, yeah.

00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:56.748
So, I managed to get
into the United Kingdom with no issues,

00:47:56.832 --> 00:47:59.251
which is really fantastic.

00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:02.379
<i>Well, I just want you
to mentally be okay with this,</i>

00:48:02.462 --> 00:48:06.091
<i>'cause what you're doing
is a monumental undertaking.</i>

00:48:06.174 --> 00:48:07.133
I know.

00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.719
<i>And I still fear for your life.</i>

00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:09.803
Yeah.

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.097
<i>With the powerful people
that are involved...</i>

00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:13.807
Yeah, I know.

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:15.976
<i>You just have to be careful all the time.</i>

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.853
I know, but I can't keep quiet

00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:20.147
just because it'll make
powerful people mad.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.066
<i>I know. I know, I know, I know. I know.</i>

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.111
<i>I totally get that, you know.</i>

00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:30.908
<i>Somebody's always got to bring down
these jerks.</i>

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.200
Exactly.

00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:34.953
<i>So, you know, anyway.</i>

00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:37.039
<i>When I have time off next month,</i>

00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:40.667
<i>I've gotta go and put deposits down
on electric and gas.</i>

00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:44.379
<i>I don't have $1,000 right now,
so I'll have to wait.</i>

00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:47.382
Well, I could...
I could pay for it. That means...

00:48:47.466 --> 00:48:49.885
<i>Oh, don't worry,
I don't need it right now.</i>

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.472
<i>All right, honey, you stay healthy.</i>

00:48:53.555 --> 00:48:54.472
Love you.

00:48:54.473 --> 00:48:55.599
<i>Be safe, honey. I love you.</i>

00:48:55.682 --> 00:48:56.599
I love you. Bye-bye.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.809
<i>Bye-bye, baby.</i>

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:09.821
I'm really happy to be back,

00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:14.368
but I don't think I can really do much
going out in public while I'm here.

00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:18.664
Last time I left,

00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:23.627
I was in a very difficult situation
with a lot of my friends.

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.934
- So fire door number one?
- Yes.

00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:27.673
What?

00:49:29.883 --> 00:49:33.345
So many people were so angry
that I was working on the Brexit campaign,

00:49:33.428 --> 00:49:36.682
so angry I continued to work for a company

00:49:36.765 --> 00:49:39.601
that supported people
like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:45.649
And there's still this whole group
of people that are wondering,

00:49:45.732 --> 00:49:49.361
am I taking the high road,
or am I doing something to protect myself?

00:49:56.368 --> 00:49:58.137
<i>More news on Facebook over the weekend,</i>

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.580

It's today's <i>FT.</i>

00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:23.729
My name's at the top of the front page
of the <i>FT.</i>

00:50:23.812 --> 00:50:24.855
Oh, shit.

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.566
There it is.

00:50:29.234 --> 00:50:31.111
"Zuckerberg braced for Congress grilling.

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:34.573
Facebook chief will admit
that the social network did not do enough

00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:37.117
to stop its tools being used for harm."

00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:41.538
"Facebook should pay its
two billion users for their personal data.

00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:47.294
Yesterday."

00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:50.797
Um...

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.301
I sort of missed the paragraph of, like,

00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:57.554
"I helped build this monster

00:50:58.472 --> 00:50:59.472
that...

00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:05.395
wreaked havoc upon the world
and will take decades to recover from,

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:10.025
and I feel really bad about that."
I don't see that here.

00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:14.071
The data wars have begun.

00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:28.627
I mean, this is a company
that is a superstate,

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:33.131
and the only nation
that has jurisdiction over it is ours.

00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:44.810
The Committees on the Judiciary
and Commerce, Science and Transportation

00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:46.228
will come to order.

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:51.024
Chairman Grassley
and members of the committee:

00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:57.364
My top priority has always been
our social mission of connecting people,

00:51:57.447 --> 00:52:00.158
building community,
and bringing the world closer together.

00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:04.538
<i>But it's clear now that we didn't
do enough to prevent these tools</i>

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.206
<i>from being used for harm as well.</i>

00:52:06.706 --> 00:52:09.417
<i>Before I talk about the steps
we're taking to address them,</i>

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:10.981
<i>I want to talk about how we got here.</i>

00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:14.172
<i>When we first contacted
Cambridge Analytica,</i>

00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:16.466
they told us
that they had deleted the data.

00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:17.842
About a month ago,

00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:20.303
we heard new reports
that suggested that wasn't true.

00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:25.225
<i>So, we're getting to the bottom
of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did.</i>

00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:28.019
Blame it on me, Mark. Go for it.

00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:30.689
<i>...to address this and to prevent it
from happening again.</i>

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:35.318
Thank you for having me here today,
and I'm ready to take your questions.

00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:40.907
Well, Mr. Zuckerberg,
during the 2016 campaign,

00:52:41.032 --> 00:52:44.286
Cambridge Analytica worked
with the Trump campaign

00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:47.789
to refine tactics under Project Alamo.

00:52:47.873 --> 00:52:50.292
Were Facebook employees involved in that?

00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:54.480
Senator, I don't know that our employees
were involved with Cambridge Analytica.

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:56.464
- Yes, they were.
- Whoa!

00:52:56.548 --> 00:52:57.591
Oh, my God.

00:52:57.674 --> 00:53:00.468
The Republican team in DC was. I met them.

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:03.680
...although I know that we did help out
the Trump campaign overall

00:53:03.763 --> 00:53:06.600
in sales support in the same way
that we do with other campaigns.

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.560
So, they may have been involved

00:53:08.643 --> 00:53:11.271
and all working together
during that time period?

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:14.107
Maybe that's something
your investigation will find out.

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:16.818
Senator, I can certainly
have my team get back to you

00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:19.946
on any specifics there
that I don't know sitting here today.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.782
Oh, my God. This is the whole point
of the hearing, you...

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:25.493
- Know what I'm talking about?
- No, I do not.

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:26.577
Okay.

00:53:27.996 --> 00:53:29.122
It can go to you.

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:33.585
Do you think the 87 million users,
do you consider them victims?

00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:36.463
Uh, Senator, I think...

00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:38.048
Uh...

00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:42.010
Yes. I mean, they... they did not want
their information to be

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:46.014
sold to Cambridge Analytica
by a developer. And... And...

00:53:46.348 --> 00:53:47.515
that happened.

00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:49.309
And it happened on our watch.

00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:50.936
So even though we didn't do it,

00:53:51.019 --> 00:53:53.563
I think we have a responsibility
to be able to prevent that

00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:55.190
and be able to take action sooner.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.734
<i>One of the steps that we need to take now</i>

00:53:57.817 --> 00:54:00.946
is go do a full audit
of all of Cambridge Analytica's systems

00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:04.449
<i>to understand what they're doing,
whether they still have any data...</i>

00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:08.411
<i>Obviously, Facebook has been done
considerable reputational damage</i>

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:10.956
<i>by its association
with Cambridge Analytica.</i>

00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:13.541
<i>...process by which Cambridge Analytica...</i>

00:54:13.625 --> 00:54:15.228
<i>...relates to Cambridge Analytica...</i>

00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:18.255
<i>The recent stories
about Cambridge Analytica</i>

00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:19.941
<i>and data mining...</i>

00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:23.176
Look at how many people
are posting Zuckerberg...

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.321
- Everyone's watching this.
- Oh, my God.

00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:27.281
- And the whole thing just says...
- Wow.

00:54:27.305 --> 00:54:29.307
...Cambridge, Cambridge,
Cambridge.

00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:33.687
I never thought
everyone in the world

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.064
would know who Cambridge Analytica was.

00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:49.536
I learnt many things from that period.

00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:53.707
I learnt, for example,
that when you're in a PR crisis,

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:56.835
the one thing that you can't hire
is a PR crisis company.

00:54:57.168 --> 00:54:59.337
We spoke to...

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:05.010
...tens of PR crisis companies
that listened intently,

00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:07.220
went away to think about it,
and came back and said,

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:10.557
"Sorry, we can't associate ourselves
with your brand."

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.395
Um... And actually, I thought
that's what they were there, um, for.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:19.858
And so it became impossible to, um...
to get a voice.

00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:29.075
The reason that we've called
this news conference today

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:33.913
is to begin to counter
some of the unfounded allegations

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:38.168
and, frankly, the torrent of ill-informed
and inaccurate speculation.

00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:49.929
Do you think what was done was illegal?

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:51.765
We think it is probably illegal

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:54.517
according to UK law,
and that's what we're challenging.

00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:56.936
We do have a statement
from Cambridge Analytica.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.438
Cambridge said,

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:01.775
"David Carroll has no more right
to submit this request

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:05.737
than a member of the Taliban
sitting in a cave in Afghanistan."

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:10.867
<i>And it came like a tsunami.</i>

00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:16.331
<i>There were 35,000 media stories per day.</i>

00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:22.087
<i>They wanted to discredit Trump,</i>

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.839
<i>they wanted to discredit Brexit,</i>

00:56:24.923 --> 00:56:26.841
<i>and we were the vehicle for doing it.</i>

00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:31.012
Do you feel
that you have skewed democracy?

00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:36.351
By providing campaign services
to a candidate who'd been fairly nominated

00:56:36.434 --> 00:56:39.646
as the Republican representative
of the United States?

00:56:40.105 --> 00:56:41.523
How is that possible?

00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:46.027
<i>Cambridge Analytica became responsible</i>

00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:49.864
<i>for pretty much everything
that was wrong in the world.</i>

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.622
Are you saying
that Cambridge Analytica lies?

00:56:57.705 --> 00:57:00.417
They knowingly misrepresent the truth.

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.168
What's your proof of that?

00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:04.087
I was there.

00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:08.133
Chris Wylie spoke with great authority

00:57:08.216 --> 00:57:11.094
about what had gone on
in Cambridge Analytica and SCL

00:57:11.177 --> 00:57:14.222
during 2015 and 2016,

00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:17.517
at a time when he was never there.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.939
He had worked for the company
for nine months, left in 2014.

00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:28.153
He then went out and pitched
the Trump campaign,

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.281
and lost to us.

00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:37.328
Chris Wylie set out to kill the company.

00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:41.332
And what about Brittany?

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:48.965
I don't know what Brittany was doing.

00:57:54.387 --> 00:57:56.264
Brittany was someone that...

00:57:57.015 --> 00:58:00.185
I thought was a friend,
I know Alexander thought was a friend.

00:58:01.436 --> 00:58:02.562
But, you know,

00:58:04.105 --> 00:58:06.441
when the world gets turned upside down,

00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:11.738
people behave in different ways.

00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:15.450
Maybe even they don't understand

00:58:16.284 --> 00:58:18.495
why they're doing what they're doing
at the time.

00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:28.713
I would strongly recommend
that we start doing testimony prep.

00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:32.300
Uh, go through the emails together,

00:58:32.383 --> 00:58:35.720
maybe go through other stuff
and hash out what's there.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.557
Oh, my God. I have my entire calendar.

00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:43.144
Shit. Shit.

00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:45.989
- You have your entire calendar?
- I have my entire calendar.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.273
Oh, my God.

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:48.650
Downloaded?

00:58:48.733 --> 00:58:52.195
I didn't think that
that was going to still link.

00:58:52.278 --> 00:58:53.363
That's amazing.

00:58:53.446 --> 00:58:56.050
I can actually do an entire timeline
of everything, if that's the case.

00:58:56.074 --> 00:58:57.234
A timeline is great.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.160
Fuck, look at this.

00:58:59.744 --> 00:59:02.580
September 2015.

00:59:04.749 --> 00:59:06.626
US Chamber of Commerce...

00:59:07.126 --> 00:59:08.211
Meeting at...

00:59:11.172 --> 00:59:13.883
Leave.EU. That was fun. Run-through.

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:15.009
It's all here.

00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:17.762
I know exactly when everything happened.

00:59:17.845 --> 00:59:19.472
Always. Forever.

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.186
I didn't realize how much I had.

00:59:25.687 --> 00:59:27.021
I've got much more than that,

00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:30.108
it's just those are the things I forwarded
that I think are worthwhile.

00:59:36.197 --> 00:59:38.783
Did you get the chance
to look through all of that?

00:59:38.866 --> 00:59:41.666
I went through most of it.
I'll look through more of it today.

00:59:44.664 --> 00:59:47.417
Let me get out
one of the pitches. Um...

00:59:47.667 --> 00:59:49.919
"CA Political."

00:59:52.171 --> 00:59:53.339
What is this?

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.592
This looks mental.

00:59:57.343 --> 01:00:02.849
This is a list of, like,
the main sources of data.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:08.104
And look, it's got that f***ing Facebook
data set of 30 million individuals.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:09.856
It just says it in there!

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.608
What the f***!

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.401
Oh, my God.

01:00:14.068 --> 01:00:16.738
- February...
- Created February 4th, 2016!

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:19.866
That was after we said to Facebook
that we deleted that shit!

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.036
This is the 30 million individuals

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.205
that we got their data
through Professor Kogan.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.498
That's that.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.794
And it admits to it right here,
"Our data makes us different,"

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:36.174
because we're scraping people's profiles,
and other people are not.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:38.967
Fuck.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.977
I forgot about this stuff, you know?

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.772
There's just so much stuff.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.243
<i>...we seek to do as a firm.</i>

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.788
<i>We are a behavior change agency.</i>

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:11.125
<i>The holy grail of communications is</i>

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.294
<i>when you can start to change behavior.</i>

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:18.633
<i>Uh, Trinidad. This is a great,
interesting case history</i>

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:20.218
<i>of how we look at problems.</i>

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.682
<i>There are two main political parties,</i>

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.642
<i>one for the blacks
and one for the Indians.</i>

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:29.727
<i>And you know, they screw each other.</i>

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.064
<i>So, we were working for the Indians.</i>

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.985
<i>We went to the client and we said,
"We want to target the youth."</i>

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:42.365
<i>And we try and increase apathy.</i>

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.910
<i>The campaign had to be non-political,</i>

01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:47.704
<i>because the kids
don't care about politics.</i>

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.748
<i>It had to be reactive,
because they're lazy.</i>

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:54.961
<i>So we came up with this campaign,
which was all about:</i>

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.171
<i>Be part of the gang. Do something cool.</i>

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.423
<i>Be part of a movement.</i>

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.967
<i>And it was called the "Do So!" campaign.</i>

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.024
<i>It means "I'm not going to vote."</i>

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.887
<i>"Do so! Don't vote."</i>

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.726
The salute of resistance

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.729
that is known to all
across Trinidad and Tobago.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.481
Do So! Do So!

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.484
Do So!

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:21.988
<i>It's a sign of resistance against,
not the government,</i>

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.574
<i>against politics and voting.</i>

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:27.034
<i>- ♪ Run with it, run with it ♪
- ♪ Run, run ♪</i>

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.762
<i>- ♪ Run with it, run with it ♪
- ♪ Run, run ♪</i>

01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:31.164
<i>They're making their own YouTube videos.</i>

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.667
<i>This is the prime minister's house
that's being graffitied.</i>

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.502
<i>It was carnage.</i>

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:41.048
<i>We knew that when it came to voting,</i>

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:44.177
<i>all the Afro-Caribbean kids wouldn't vote,</i>

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.261
<i>because they Do So!</i>

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:48.973
<i>But all the Indian kids would do
what their parents told them to do,</i>

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:50.808
<i>which is go out and vote.</i>

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.269
<i>They had a lot of fun doing this,</i>

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:56.397
<i>but they're not gonna go
against their parents' will.</i>

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:05.072
Thank God for the guidance
that has brought us here to this victory.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.492
Thank you. Thank you, God.

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:12.663
<i>And the difference in
18-to 35-year-old turnout was like 40%.</i>

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:16.209
<i>And that swung the election about 6%,</i>

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.253
<i>which was all we needed
in an election that's very close.</i>

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:28.179
<i>We now undertake ten national campaigns
for prime minister or president each year.</i>

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.389
<i>Malaysia, we're working in.</i>

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:34.602
<i>We did Lithuania, Romania,
Kenya, Ghana.</i>

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:37.266
- <i>So quite a few this year.
- Nigeria.</i>

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:40.650
- <i>The Brexit campaign?
- Oh, and the Brexit campaign, yeah.</i>

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:42.902
<i>But we don't talk about that.</i>

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.278
<i>Oops, we won!</i>

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.912
Do you worry at all
that she might let you down?

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.251
Look, um...

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.135
That is a good question.

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:15.184
I know already that she is
a complicated person, uh,

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.435
who has...

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.773
you know, done some complicated things.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.608
Uh...

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:26.571
I believe in redemption.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:35.371
Uh, individual redemption
and collective... uh, social redemption.

01:04:35.454 --> 01:04:39.041
Uh, I'm an idealist.
I think we can fix stuff that's broken,

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:42.962
uh, and, at the same time,

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:46.591
I am a realist about the fact
that you can't fix everything. Um...

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:49.176
You know, some things get broken
and stay broken.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.018
Good morning,
welcome to this further session

01:04:57.101 --> 01:05:00.104
of the Digital, Culture,
Media and Sport Select Committee.

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:02.773
Very pleased to welcome Brittany Kaiser
to give evidence to

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.442
<i>the committee this morning.</i>

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:09.739
Now, there was a contact between Facebook
and Cambridge Analytica

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:14.994
about the use of data in,
I think it was 2015, from memory.

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:18.205
Did you know about that at the time?

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.876
Uh, so Facebook had announced
to all of their clients

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:25.296
<i>that they were going to close
their clients' access to this data,</i>

01:05:25.963 --> 01:05:27.673
<i>so we agreed to delete it,</i>

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.010
but in March 2016,

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.304
you know, six or eight weeks after

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:37.141
our chief data officer said
that those data sets were deleted,

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:40.227
I have an email from one
of our senior data scientists

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:44.941
that said that we were actually using
Facebook Like data in our modeling.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.525
Ooh.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.903
- <i>So that seems strange to me.</i>
- Uh-oh.

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:51.131
<i>If we had deleted
all of the Facebook data sets,</i>

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:53.491
<i>how we were still using that
for modeling in March.</i>

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.596
Ms. Kaiser, you seem to have traveled
a long way from an idealistic intern

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.288
in Barack Obama's campaign,

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:03.376
uh, to working for a company
that keeps pretty unsavory company,

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:07.213
uh, in wishing to make pitches
to far-right political parties.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.799
- Mm-hmm.
- Didn't that make you uncomfortable?

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:10.966
Uh, yes.

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:15.846
<i>I would say questioning the ethics of it
is correct, definitely.</i>

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:19.892
But I have been offered introductions
to clients

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.686
that I refused to meet with before,

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:25.940
um, such as the Alternative for Germany
and Marine Le Pen's campaign.

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:29.235
I refused to even get on a phone call
with them.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:31.696
But not UKIP?

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.572
Not UKIP, no.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:38.869
Um, did you appear and give a presentation
to the launch of Leave. EU?

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.121
Yes, I did.

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:42.999
Um, you must've been a bit, um,
disappointed then

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.501
when you subsequently
didn't do any work for them.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.838
And we didn't do any further work for them
after that day, yes.

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:50.273
So you had done some work.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.633
What was the nature of the work
that you had done so far?

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.968
We had taken receipt

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:57.388
of UK Independence Party data
and the survey data.

01:06:57.471 --> 01:07:03.352
She's, like, contradicting Nix a lot,
what he said previously.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.956
So, I think you've been quite clear,
as far as you're concerned,

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:10.026
you were working on the campaign,
but just not being paid for it?

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.069
- Mm-hmm.
- You're pretty clear on that.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.739
Just to clarify, for our benefit,

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.615
to be effective in this space,

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.951
how big a kind of working set do you need

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:22.163
to be able to then
use that to create the basis

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:24.790
for targeting the whole country
in terms of voting?

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:27.185
I'm not a data scientist,
so I wouldn't be able to say

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.712
the minimum number
of data points that you would require,

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.673
uh, but I do know
that their targeting tool

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:36.594
<i>used to be export-controlled
by the British government,</i>

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:39.930
so that would mean that
the methodology was considered a weapon.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.267
Um, weapons-grade communications tactics.

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:46.896
What you're saying is that the proposal
was for Leave. EU to use what you call

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:50.858
weapons-grade communications techniques
against the UK population?

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:53.903
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- It's crazy.

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:56.989
<i>Uh, I just want to get
your perspective as well.</i>

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.158
What do you actually think
the legislators should do

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.368
in order to better protect people's data?

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:05.956
<i>Well, I'm very glad that
you asked that. Think about it right now.</i>

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.459
<i>The sole worth of Google and Facebook</i>

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:12.046
is the fact that they own, and possess,
and hold, and use

01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:14.249
the personal data
of people from all around the world.

01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:17.218
<i>So I think that the best way
to move forward</i>

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:21.180
<i>are for people to really possess
their data like their property.</i>

01:08:21.847 --> 01:08:23.825
<i>- Thank you, Chair.
- Thank you.</i>

01:08:23.849 --> 01:08:26.602
Um, I think that concludes the questions
from us today.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.005
Just before we close the session,

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.981
I just have to make a short announcement
about Alexander Nix.

01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:34.193
<i>He's now not able to give evidence
to the Committee tomorrow</i>

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.321
<i>as a consequence of him having been served
with an information notice</i>

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:39.244
<i>and being subject
to the criminal investigation</i>

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:41.367
<i>by the Information Commissioner's Office.</i>

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:44.036
<i>And I hope we'll be able to update people</i>

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.413
about that early next week.
Thank you very much.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.081
Thank you.

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:49.750
Shit!

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:53.045
<i>The proceeding has ended.</i>

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.129
Yes, it has!

01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:13.732
I just got a text from Alexander.

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.486
Alexander Nix.

01:09:20.447 --> 01:09:21.615
What did he say?

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:25.619
"Well done, Britt.
Looked quite tough, and you did okay."

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:29.540
With a winky face little emoji.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.794
It makes me kind of sad.
You know what I mean?

01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:36.088
Like, it's not like he spent
three and a half years

01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:37.923
being an asshole to me. He didn't.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.443
He spent three and a half years
being nice to you

01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:42.261
to get you to do what he wanted you to do.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:46.473
Yeah. But he is rather fun.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.243
I know, I know.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:49.310
Hey, Justin.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.146
<i>Hey, what's up? What did you think?</i>

01:09:52.646 --> 01:09:55.441
I'm processing it.
There were a lot of revelations.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:00.988
SCL has to file its defense
at the end of the month,

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:04.200
so, it'll be really interesting
to see, like,

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:07.328
what they think they can do,
especially after this.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:09.205
<i>That's right.</i>

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.290
I mean, shit.

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:15.753
She said that basically psychographics
should be classified as a weapon.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:23.719
It seems like Kaiser has
some moral compass in her.

01:10:26.805 --> 01:10:30.392
But, so many times,
she knew that she was

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.061
in a dark world

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.896
and didn't step away.

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:37.191
And they... they got... got her on that
a couple of times.

01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:38.274
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:45.157
You did work for a man who,
upon meeting you,

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.927
said to you, you know,
"Let me get you drunk

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.452
and steal your secrets."

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:51.789
You knew the kind of company
that you were working for.

01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:54.208
I don't know. I guess I trusted him.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.377
I worked for him
for three and a half years.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.171
He was a friend and mentor. I mean...

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:01.465
He actually just sent me a text,

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:05.135
although I haven't spoken to him in,
I don't know, at least over a month.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.696
So, he was watching you.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.720
- He watched, yes.
- What did he say?

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:12.393
He said that it looked pretty tough
but that I did a good job.

01:11:12.476 --> 01:11:14.520
- Did you reply?
- No.

01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:15.854
Will you?

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.482
No, I don't think that's appropriate
at this time.

01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:21.110
So, there's no friendship there?

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:27.658
Well, I now question, you know,
how much of a friendship it actually was.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:52.141
The thing which
I give Brittany credit for...

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.520
it's really amazed me how many people
are just keeping their mouths shut.

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:03.485
I mean, it was a jaw-dropping moment

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:08.866
when Brittany said these are classified
as weapons-grade technology.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.994
And it was actually illegal to use those

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.455
without the permission
of the British government.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.710
It's psyops.

01:12:20.961 --> 01:12:24.214
Psyops is psychological operations.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.801
And it's a...
it's a term that the military uses

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:32.348
to describe what you do in warfare
which isn't warfare.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.350
So, essentially, you know,

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.602
in a place like Afghanistan,
you've got a choice.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.562
You either bomb the shit out of a village

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:41.398
or you try and use other techniques

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:44.943
to persuade them that actually,
"The Taliban's not very good,

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.862
and you'd be much better off
without them."

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:54.203
SCL started out as a military contractor.

01:12:54.286 --> 01:12:55.454
SCL Defense.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:00.417
<i>We have a fairly substantial
defense business.</i>

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.837
<i>We actually train the British Army,
the British Navy,</i>

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.464
<i>the U.S. Army, U.S. Special Forces.</i>

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:09.009
<i>We train NATO, the CIA,
State Department, Pentagon.</i>

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:15.099
<i>It's using research to influence behavior
of hostile audiences.</i>

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:20.646
<i>You know, how do you persuade
14-to 30-year-old Muslim boys</i>

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.356
<i>not to join Al-Qaeda?</i>

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.942
<i>Essentially communication warfare.</i>

01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:26.985
- Allahu Akbar!
- Allahu Akbar!

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.948
They'd worked
in Afghanistan, they'd worked in Iraq,

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:34.576
they'd worked in various places
in Eastern Europe.

01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:37.663
But the real game changer

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:42.918
was they started using information warfare
in elections.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:47.714
<i>There's a lot of overlap,
because it's all the same methodology.</i>

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:55.139
All of the campaigns
which Cambridge Analytica/SCL did

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.599
for the developing world,

01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:02.020
it was all about practicing
some new technology or trick.

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.106
How to persuade people,

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:07.943
how to suppress turnout,
or how to increase turnout.

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:11.654
And then it's like,

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:15.075
"Okay, now we've got the hang of it,
let's use it in Britain and America."

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:43.269
Yes.

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:22.643
...and expands, but with no branding,

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:25.646
so it's unattributable, untrackable.

01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:28.565
And my view...

01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:32.569
<i>is that if you can't run your own house,</i>

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:35.447
<i>you certainly can't run the White House.</i>

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.990
<i>Can't do it.</i>

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:41.620
<i>Crooked Hillary, right? Crooked.
She's crooked as you can be.</i>

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.413
Lock her up! Lock her up!

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:45.415
Yep, that's right, lock her up!

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:47.251
Lock her up! Lock her up!

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:49.920
Lock her up! Lock her up!

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:54.424
Let's defeat her in November.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.482
What was it like for you to watch

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.526
the Channel 4 undercover video?

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.612
Nobody recognized it.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.701
When we watched that video...

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:25.872
I watched it in the New York office
with, um, all the staff there.

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:27.791
And we knew it was coming out.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.377
And I think everybody was...

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.255
in a state of shock.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:40.095
Everybody walked away from the screen
in silence back to their desks.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:51.398
<i>Tonight, an undercover
interview by </i>Channel 4 News<i> in London</i>

01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:52.983
<i>shows Cambridge executives,</i>

<i>This series of undercover interviews

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.076
<i>also caught Nix on tape</i>

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.038
<i>talking about potential bribery
and entrapment.</i>

01:17:08.832 --> 01:17:10.334
I don't understand.

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.798
Mr. Nix, can I ask you
what your message is

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:19.217
to Cambridge Analytica employees today?

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.780
<i>We've just got a statement
from Cambridge Analytica.</i>

01:17:25.932 --> 01:17:29.686
<i>Alexander Nix has been suspended
with immediate effect.</i>

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:34.066
The company accused of harvesting the data
of more than 87 million Facebook users

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.484
says it is shutting down.

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:40.489
The company says it intends to file
for bankruptcy in the US and the UK.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.576
<i>Critics believe Cambridge Analytica</i>

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.496
<i>and SCL Elections
may be shutting operations</i>

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:51.583
<i>to limit or restrict the ability
of the authority's investigations</i>

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.794
<i>and also to get rid of evidence.</i>

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.364
The Cambridge Analytica scandal,

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:05.972
is it now the Facebook scandal?

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.185
I mean, this is not about one company.

01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:16.608
This technology is going on unabated
and will continue to go on.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.653
But Cambridge Analytica's gone.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.532
In some senses, I feel that, um...

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:30.038
that because of the way
that this technology is moving so fast,

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:34.710
and because people
don't really understand it,

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:37.170
and because there's a lot of concerns
about it,

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:40.215
there was always going to be
a Cambridge Analytica.

01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:43.218
It just sucks for me
it was Cambridge Analytica.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.733
After we dealt with the threats

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.527
from Cambridge Analytica
over the course of a year,

01:19:01.027 --> 01:19:03.363
then the thing which made
our heads explode

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:06.283
was the day before publication,
when we got a letter from Facebook.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:10.245
Yeah, it felt like an attempt
to... to cow us into submission.

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:11.747
It didn't feel like a sort of...

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.499
To me, it didn't feel like
a legitimate response...

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:18.462
And you sort of go, you know,
why is a great, big organization like you

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:20.130
using UK lawyers?

01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:22.382
And again, a very aggressive threat

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.318
for which, actually, they then...
Didn't they apologize?

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:26.178
Yes,
they said it was not their finest hour.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.888
Yeah.

01:19:27.971 --> 01:19:29.473
And up until that point,

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:31.808
it was like the tech giants were still,
like,

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.727
the nice guys who wear hoodies,

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:35.562
- who connected the world.
- Yep.

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:37.898
And there was a shift away

01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:39.983
from big tech being good

01:19:40.066 --> 01:19:43.945
to saying well, actually,
we do need to start asking questions

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:46.364
about this and what it is.

01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:52.245
Cambridge Analytica is gone,

01:19:52.829 --> 01:19:58.502
but it's really important to understand
that the Cambridge Analytica story

01:19:58.668 --> 01:20:02.923
actually points to this much bigger,
more worrying story

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:08.637
which is that our personal data
is out there and being used against us

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.931
in ways we don't understand.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.520
And if David gets his data back,

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.856
we can hopefully start
getting some answers.

01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:26.780
The deadline is today for SCL
to comply with the law

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:28.615
and give me my data.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:35.497
We're at the precipice of evasion
or accountability.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:40.210
Carole tweeted,

01:20:40.293 --> 01:20:43.421
"Prof. Carroll also giving evidence
to European Parliament today

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:47.634
on day of deadline for Cambridge Analytica
to turn over his data to him.

01:20:47.717 --> 01:20:51.388
If it fails to do so, it becomes
a matter for criminal proceedings."

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:58.728
"Hey Ravi, have you heard anything?"

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:01.356
"Not yet."

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:11.783
I've been waiting to hear from my lawyer,
and we have heard nothing.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.244
And so they have not respected
the regulator.

01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:16.788
They are not respecting the law.

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.666
So now that this is becoming
a criminal matter,

01:21:19.749 --> 01:21:21.626
we are now in uncharted waters.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:26.298
And I will continue to pursue it

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:30.051
because their model has the potential
to affect a population

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.596
even if it's just a tiny slice
of the population,

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.264
because in the United States,

01:21:34.347 --> 01:21:39.436
only about 70,000 voters in three states
decided the election.

01:21:42.188 --> 01:21:45.275
Thank you very much,
um, Professor Carroll. Um...

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:46.818
Mr. Batten.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:51.281
My question is
for Carole Cadwalladr from <i>The Guardian.</i>

01:21:51.364 --> 01:21:56.077
Is <i>The Guardian's</i> stand
on this a purely politically partisan one

01:21:56.161 --> 01:22:00.040
in its own intention to assist
in any way that it can

01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:03.251
to reverse and overturn
the result of the referendum?

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:10.258
This is not a partisan issue,
I cannot say that more strongly.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:14.304
This is about the integrity
of our democracy.

01:22:14.387 --> 01:22:17.057
It's about our national sovereignty.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.061
And I would think that you would have
an interest in that also.

01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:28.234
I think that we desperately need
more information,

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.154
because we don't how people were targeted

01:22:31.237 --> 01:22:33.782
and we don't know what data
that was based upon.

01:22:34.157 --> 01:22:40.956
One thing we do know is that Facebook
has been obstructive in its efforts

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.708
to help the British Parliament
investigate this matter.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:48.755
Uh, really, really, really,
you've got to, like, look higher

01:22:48.838 --> 01:22:50.966
and really see the bigger issue here

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.635
and the bigger picture
and the bigger risks to us all.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:07.983
<i>Roger, even if, uh, Facebook
hasn't broken any laws,</i>

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:12.320
<i>have they broken a sort of moral trust
that they have with their consumers?</i>

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.197
Well, I... They have with me.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.743
I mean, I spent three months,
starting in October 2016, trying to say,

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:22.455
"Guys, I think you're killing democracy,
and you're gonna kill your business."

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.833
- Hi, how are you? I'm Roger.
- Hi, how are you?

01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:26.811
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:31.131
Facebook is designed
to monopolize attention.

01:23:31.589 --> 01:23:34.509
Just taking all of the basic tricks
of propaganda,

01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:37.053
marrying them to the tricks
of casino gambling.

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:39.014
You know, slot machines and the like.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:43.977
And basically playing on instincts,

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:47.772
and fear and anger are the two
most dependable ways of doing that.

01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:50.483
And so, they created a set of tools

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:56.197
to allow advertisers to exploit
that emotional audience

01:23:57.073 --> 01:24:00.368
with individual-level targeting, right?

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:05.623
There's 2.1 billion people,
each with their own reality.

01:24:05.915 --> 01:24:08.251
And once everybody has their own reality,

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:11.463
- it's relatively easy to manipulate them.
- Mmm. Yeah.

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:16.926
And the other thing about this is,
they know that it's killing me...

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:18.678
- Yeah.
- ...to be critical

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:20.597
of what I've viewed as my baby.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.809
It is a lot easier to just sort of say,
"I'm not gonna think about it."

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:25.893
Yes.

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:27.645
- But...
- Yeah.

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:31.191
...you get tested in your life
a few times, right? And...

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.151
for me, this was one of those moments.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.004
I was either gonna stand up
and do something about this,

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:37.781
or I wasn't gonna stand up
and do anything about anything. Right?

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:40.533
Because my fingerprints are on this thing.

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:43.495
- I know.
- I mean, I felt really guilty.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.332
And I just want to be able to...

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:49.876
sleep at night.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:12.774
One of the things
that I was really struck by was...

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:15.318
what happened with you

01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:17.487
and the Obama people
and the Hillary people.

01:25:18.863 --> 01:25:22.325
Uh, none of them ever wanted
to offer to pay me.

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:27.497
And, um,
when your family loses all their money

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.375
and loses their family home

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:33.002
and your father,
who's the main breadwinner,

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.588
has brain surgery
and can never work again,

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:38.925
you have to work for people that pay you.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:45.265
Your family lost their money in 2008?

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:49.519
Um, yeah, but it took a while
for it all to really fall apart.

01:25:49.602 --> 01:25:50.854
- Yeah.
- Um...

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:57.026
We lost our family home in 2014,
when I started working for Cambridge.

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:12.375
<i>Alexander Nix appears
before Parliament's Media Committee</i>

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:14.460
<i>after previously refusing to testify</i>

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:17.338
<i>due to law enforcement investigations
into the firm.</i>

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.887
- Hi, Jo, how are you?
- Hello.

01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:29.058
<i>The last time I was in London,</i>

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:33.188
<i>I remember considering challenging SCL</i>

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:38.651
<i>and running through my head, like,
how scary it was.</i>

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.572
The Committee's very grateful, uh,
to Alexander Nix

01:26:42.655 --> 01:26:45.408
for agreeing to come back
in front of the committee today

01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:47.243
to answer our questions...

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:49.120
<i>Now, to be back here and, uh...</i>

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:52.457
<i>these guys are down for the count and...</i>

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.876
<i>the villain is up against the wall.</i>

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:59.505
<i>You know,
does he have any allies left in the world</i>

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:02.634
<i>or has everybody turned against him?</i>

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:05.720
Right.

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:09.849
I'd like to make
a few short clarifications.

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:12.560
Um, these will only take a few minutes,

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:17.273
uh, but it is important
to be able to frame, uh, my answers.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:18.358
He's so nervous.

01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:20.461
Mr. Nix, I'd be grateful if you'd start
with the committee's questions

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.087
and then see how we go
through the hearing.

01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:26.449
Ordinarily, uh, I would respect that,
but these aren't ordinary circumstances,

01:27:26.532 --> 01:27:30.203
and so, if I may, I'd like to start
with a very brief statement

01:27:30.286 --> 01:27:31.663
just to set out my position.

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:34.332
I would rather take this
on a question by question basis

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:37.126
rather than being dealt with
as a statement at the beginning.

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.587
Mr. Collins,
you'll have plenty of opportunity,

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:43.174
as will all the Committee,
to ask me as many questions as you want,

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.134
but I have to insist on...

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:48.614
- How could you possibly start like that...
<i>- It's not your place to insist.</i>

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:51.724
"I accept that some of my answers
could have been clearer..."

01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:54.560
So, instead,
you're just reading out the statement.

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:58.189
<i>- Can you answer the first question...</i>
- Why is he doing that?

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:02.456
- Could you repeat your first question?
- Yes, thank you.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:05.238
<i>You did pitch to work on the Referendum,</i>

01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:09.284
<i>and I don't want to dwell on Leave. EU
because you've made your position clear.</i>

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:12.912
We're really scratching around here,
Mr. Farrelly. Um...

01:28:13.329 --> 01:28:17.417
We've been working, or I've been working
with this company for 15 years. Um...

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.086
<i>We've never undertaken an election
in the UK.</i>

01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:21.462
<i>Well, I was...</i>

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.732
<i>- I hope I wasn't scratching around.
- </i>That is not true.

01:28:23.756 --> 01:28:26.759
<i>I was comparing what you told us
with the evidence</i>

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:28.344
<i>that's subsequently emerged,</i>

01:28:28.428 --> 01:28:30.468
<i>and you clearly felt...</i>

01:28:30.513 --> 01:28:33.641
<i>...that the work that you've done, uh...</i>

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:37.186
So, I got an email from Carole.

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:40.315
She knows that I met Julian Assange
in February.

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:42.025
Um...

01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:47.155
And she knows that I donated to WikiLeaks
at some point in Bitcoin.

01:28:49.073 --> 01:28:52.076
If she prints something about it today,
it's going to make...

01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:56.372
my conversations with my own government
really difficult.

01:28:56.914 --> 01:28:59.059
<i>Um, it came up
in Brittany Kaiser's evidence,</i>

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:02.628
because you spoke to us about, uh,
Julian Assange the last time you came,

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:06.049
saying that you made an attempt
to gain access to the emails

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:08.092
that Julian Assange had, um,

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:11.554
the Hillary Clinton emails,
in order to benefit your client,

01:29:11.637 --> 01:29:12.554
<i>the Trump campaign.</i>

01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:15.099
Well, these were very contentious emails,
potentially...

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.602
- Yeah.
- ...and we wanted to understand...

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.812
as did every journalist

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:22.565
and, I would say,
most political consultants

01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:25.109
on both sides of the aisle
in the United States,

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.778
um, what was contained in them.

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:32.492
I don't think that curiosity
is indicative of anything nefarious.

01:29:32.575 --> 01:29:36.245
Oh, my God. Carole published the article.

01:29:38.122 --> 01:29:40.666
I didn't discuss the US election!

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:43.086
Oh, my God, this is insane!

01:29:43.169 --> 01:29:44.337
Paul!

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.964
- <i>Hello, how are you!</i>
- Paul!

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:50.051
I have said to you, it's all coming out,

01:29:50.134 --> 01:29:51.469
<i>and the question is how.</i>

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:54.347
I didn't conspire
to leak Hillary's emails,

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:58.184
and I have nothing...
...to do with Russia, so...

01:29:58.267 --> 01:29:59.267
<i>Yes.</i>

01:29:59.435 --> 01:30:01.020
The fact is...

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:05.233
- ...it looks like I did both.
<i>- Does it look like you did both?</i>

01:30:05.316 --> 01:30:08.694
If I wasn't me, I would say yes,
that's what it looks like!

01:30:11.155 --> 01:30:12.698
That's why I'm freaking out.

01:30:12.782 --> 01:30:15.535
There's gonna be so many people
that literally never believe me.

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:18.496
I will die
with people still not believing me.

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:21.374
<i>Uh, that is possible.</i>

01:30:21.624 --> 01:30:24.043
<i>- That is definitely possible.</i>
- I know!

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:26.170
Agh!

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.423
<i>All right...</i>

01:30:29.006 --> 01:30:31.446
I think I need
to get the f*** out of here.

01:30:34.887 --> 01:30:37.807
From where I'm sitting,
since you've come here today,

01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:41.686
you have attempted to paint yourself
as the victim here,

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:46.566
though, by no stretch of the imagination
can you be seen as a victim.

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:50.194
Surely you can see that
you are not the victim here.

01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:52.864
What if I was the victim?

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:56.868
What happens if, as some
of these investigations are concluded,

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:59.787
people realize
that actually we were simply...

01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:04.917
the guys who were, uh,
perceived to have contributed

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:06.711
to the Trump campaign

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:10.923
and were wrongly accredited
with being the architects of Brexit

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:15.636
and as a result of the polarizing nature
of those two political campaigns,

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.723
the global liberal media took umbrage

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:21.684
and decided to put us in their crosshairs

01:31:21.767 --> 01:31:26.147
and launch a coordinated attack on us
as a company

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:29.317
in order to destroy our reputations
and our business,

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:34.405
and all of this was underpinned
by a stream of allegations,

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.867
unfounded, groundless allegations
that came from Mr. Wylie,

01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:41.287
who gave the media
the ammunition that they needed...

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.164
that they wanted,

01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:46.417
to be able to attack us for something
that, in the case of Brexit,

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:47.502
we simply didn't do.

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:49.504
So you are the victim in all of this.

01:31:50.796 --> 01:31:54.717
Well, if you're sitting where I am
right now, you'd probably feel...

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.177
uh...

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.470
...quite victimized.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.514
Where the f*** is my passport?

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:03.809
Not having a good day right now.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.645
Did I put it somewhere else?

01:32:08.731 --> 01:32:09.857
Oh, my God.

01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:12.568
I've never put it there before in my life.

01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:15.613
Not that I'm thinking straight today,
so...

01:32:19.992 --> 01:32:22.662
I'm flustered. Sorry, guys.

01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:29.460
Coco Mademoiselle makes me feel better.

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:32.171
At least I smell good.

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:41.639
I have no idea what's gonna happen
in the next coming days.

01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:46.352
I literally came back here
because I wanted to be cooperative,

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:48.938
I want to help.

01:33:15.047 --> 01:33:17.192
<i>Today, </i>The Guardian <i>newspaper
in Britain reports</i>

01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:19.468
<i>that a senior executive
at Cambridge Analytica</i>

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:22.305
<i>met with Julian Assange from WikiLeaks,</i>

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:25.933
<i>which is the entity that distributed
the documents that Russia had stolen.</i>

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:31.022
<i>She says they discussed the US election.</i>

01:33:49.498 --> 01:33:52.585
The Mueller investigation called
when I booked my flight

01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:55.087
and they decided to issue a subpoena.

01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:00.635
We were talking to them
in a very, like, friendly, cooperative way

01:34:00.718 --> 01:34:05.097
and then Carole's article completely
changed the way that they see me.

01:34:06.557 --> 01:34:09.518
And, yeah, I...

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:12.438
worked at Cambridge Analytica

01:34:12.521 --> 01:34:15.399
while they had Facebook data sets.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.110
And, you know, I...

01:34:19.612 --> 01:34:23.074
went to Russia one time
while I worked for Cambridge.

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.743
I visited Julian Assange
while I worked for Cambridge.

01:34:25.951 --> 01:34:27.787
I once donated to WikiLeaks.

01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:32.416
I pitched the Trump campaign
and wrote the first contract.

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:36.170
Like, all of these things
make it look like I am...

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:40.049
at the center of some big, crazy thing.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:44.178
And I see that,
and I can't argue with that.

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:49.392
I might need to rethink the way
that I've been doing things

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:50.810
for the past few years.

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:08.661
This is a story
which we haven't published yet

01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:11.288
talking about all the investigations

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:14.333
which have been kicked off
in Britain and the US

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:16.168
since the story came out.

01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:19.630
So, there's an investigation by the FBI,

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:22.675
by the US, the SEC,

01:35:22.758 --> 01:35:24.260
by the Department of Justice,

01:35:24.343 --> 01:35:25.928
by Robert Mueller,

01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:28.556
and by the Senate Intelligence Committee,

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:31.016
the Judiciary Committee,
the House Intelligence Committee.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.060
And then these are all the ones
which are going on

01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:34.770
which are connected in Britain.

01:35:38.274 --> 01:35:41.277
<i>Parliament spent 18 months investigating.</i>

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.572
<i>They called in all these witnesses.</i>

01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:52.037
<i>And at the end of it,
their report says very clearly,</i>

01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:54.623
<i>"Our electoral laws are not fit
for purpose."</i>

01:35:56.417 --> 01:36:00.421
<i>We literally cannot have
a free and fair election in this country.</i>

01:36:01.881 --> 01:36:04.759
<i>And we can't have it because of Facebook,</i>

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:08.846
<i>because of the tech giants
who are still completely unaccountable.</i>

01:36:13.058 --> 01:36:15.478
<i>It sounds, like, quite apocalyptic.</i>

01:36:15.644 --> 01:36:19.815
<i>But it does feel like we are entering
into a whole new era.</i>

01:36:20.858 --> 01:36:24.945
<i>We can see that authoritarian governments
are on the rise.</i>

01:36:25.362 --> 01:36:31.243
<i>And they're all using these politics
of hate and fear on Facebook.</i>

01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:34.765
<i>Look at Brazil.</i>

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:38.501
<i>There's this right-wing extremist</i>

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:39.919
<i>who's been elected.</i>

01:36:40.002 --> 01:36:44.048
<i>And we know that WhatsApp,
which is a part of Facebook,</i>

01:36:44.131 --> 01:36:49.929
<i>was really clearly implicated
in the dissemination of fake news there.</i>

01:36:51.263 --> 01:36:53.474
<i>And look at what happened in Myanmar.</i>

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.727
<i>There is evidence that Facebook was used</i>

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.604
<i>to incite racial hatred</i>

01:36:58.687 --> 01:37:00.731
<i>which caused a genocide.</i>

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:13.327
<i>We also know that the Russian government
was using Facebook's tools in the US.</i>

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:24.046
<i>There's evidence that Russian intelligence
created fake Black Lives Matter memes.</i>

01:37:24.755 --> 01:37:28.509
<i>And when people clicked on them,
they were taken to pages</i>

01:37:28.592 --> 01:37:32.388
<i>where they were actually invited
to protests</i>

01:37:32.471 --> 01:37:35.724
<i>that were organized
by the Russian government.</i>

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:37.911
- Justice! Now!
- When do we want it?

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:40.080
<i>At the same time,
they were setting up pages</i>

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:44.191
<i>targeting adversary groups,
like Blue Lives Matter.</i>

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:48.696
<i>It's about stoking fear and hate</i>

01:37:48.779 --> 01:37:51.657
<i>to turn the country against itself.</i>

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.493
<i>Divide and conquer.</i>

01:37:57.329 --> 01:37:58.998
White power!

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:01.333
Fascist and proud!

01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:07.965
Fuck Donald Trump! Fuck Donald Trump!

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:12.136
<i>These platforms
which were created to connect us</i>

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.847
<i>have now been weaponized.</i>

01:38:16.765 --> 01:38:20.227
<i>And it's impossible to know what is what</i>

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:24.315
<i>because it's happening
on exactly the same platforms</i>

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:27.985
<i>that we chat to our friends
or share baby photos.</i>

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.489
<i>Nothing is what it seems.</i>

01:38:45.127 --> 01:38:47.567
- Hi, how are you?
- Doing wonderful, yourself?

01:38:47.671 --> 01:38:48.923
I'm all right.

01:38:49.006 --> 01:38:55.012
Um, I stayed here last week
and I checked in a suitcase and two bags.

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:58.474
And I had to go to the airport and just,
like, left.

01:38:58.557 --> 01:39:00.434
So my bags have been here for a week.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:08.984
<i>My guest, Carole Cadwalladr,</i>

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:12.363
<i>writes for the British newspapers</i>
The Observer <i>and </i>The Guardian.

01:39:12.863 --> 01:39:15.282
<i>Can you just say a little bit more
about the Facebook data?</i>

01:39:15.824 --> 01:39:20.871
<i>This thing of the data,
so how Americans were targeted,</i>

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:22.998
<i>and what they were targeted with,</i>

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:27.544
<i>is a sort of key part
of Mueller's investigation.</i>

01:39:30.839 --> 01:39:34.718
I am headed to Washington, DC,

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:38.430
for my testimony
for the Mueller investigation.

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:45.270
I definitely didn't think
that while we're sitting there

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:47.898
counting votes on our data screen

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.401
that some of those votes

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:56.281
were made by people
who had seen fake news stories

01:39:56.365 --> 01:39:59.451
paid for by Russia on their Facebook page.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.413
Maybe I wanted to believe

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:05.749
that Cambridge Analytica
was just the best.

01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:09.586
It's a convenient story to believe.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:28.731
<i>...service down to our nation's capital,
Washington Reagan DC airport.</i>

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:37.656
I don't think it's possible
to shed any of this.

01:40:40.075 --> 01:40:42.911
You can't really
put something like this behind you.

01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:01.805
"Youth engagement, persuasion...

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.516
apathy."

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.920
<i>Malaysia, we're working in.</i>

01:41:05.976 --> 01:41:10.105
<i>We did Lithuania, Romania,
Kenya, Ghana.</i>

01:41:10.689 --> 01:41:12.816
<i>Oh, and the Brexit campaign, yeah.</i>

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.693
<i>But we don't talk about that.</i>

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:17.821
<i>Oops, we won!</i>

01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:20.949
Listening to this now,
it just sounds like...

01:41:21.784 --> 01:41:25.913
a criminal admitting to everything
he’s done wrong around the world.

01:41:27.498 --> 01:41:28.540
You know?

01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:32.002
I'm just there,
nervously laughing along with him,

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.170
letting it happen.

01:41:41.386 --> 01:41:46.058
As I said, it's the opposite of what
I've worked my whole life to do.

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:48.727
So...

01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:55.192
it makes me angry at myself that
I could sit through a meeting like that...

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:58.153
and not quit directly afterwards,

01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:00.572
basically.

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:05.619
What was I doing?

01:42:06.411 --> 01:42:08.664
What investigators
have you been talking to?

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:13.710
I'm currently working
to be as helpful as possible

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:17.422
to any government investigations
where I can provide assistance,

01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:20.092
but I can't comment on that right now
while they're ongoing.

01:42:28.725 --> 01:42:31.270
<i>At this time,
you may use your cellular service.</i>

01:42:31.353 --> 01:42:35.023
<i>However, larger electronic devices
must remain stowed.</i>

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:37.109
Brittany made mistakes.

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:41.155
But I think it was very brave of her

01:42:41.238 --> 01:42:44.199
to come out and then to keep cooperating

01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:45.826
and not to walk away.

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:51.665
She is one of two people

01:42:51.748 --> 01:42:56.378
who has blown the whistle
in any serious way on Cambridge Analytica.

01:43:00.465 --> 01:43:01.967
We're all responsible.

01:43:04.928 --> 01:43:07.806
So the question is,
what do we do with that responsibility?

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:09.683
Can we embrace it?

01:43:12.394 --> 01:43:14.521
Happy that it's finally happening

01:43:14.605 --> 01:43:18.275
so that I can just tell people
what happened and get everything...

01:43:19.943 --> 01:43:20.944
on record

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:25.199
for this government, my government.

01:43:47.095 --> 01:43:49.181
<i>You remember, though,
Cambridge Analytica.</i>

01:43:49.431 --> 01:43:51.391
<i>Its big claim in 2016</i>

01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:53.477
<i>was that it had access to voter data</i>

01:43:53.685 --> 01:43:56.688
<i>on all of the people voting
in the US election.</i>

01:43:58.273 --> 01:44:02.402
<i>Well, just one of the 157 million people
who voted in that election,</i>

01:44:02.486 --> 01:44:06.365
<i>a man called David Carroll,
asked them a very simple question:</i>

01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:09.826
<i>"Can I see the data you have on me?"</i>

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:12.621
<i>And they refused to give it to him.</i>

01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:18.335
But crucially, today,
Cambridge Analytica pled guilty

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:22.422
at Hendon Magistrates' Court
for failing to comply with the ICO notice.

01:44:40.482 --> 01:44:43.277
<i>The Cambridge Analytica case
is behind me now.</i>

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.738
<i>They pleaded guilty
for not giving me my data,</i>

01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:50.242
<i>and I'll probably never get it back.</i>

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.330
<i>By the time my daughter is 18,</i>

01:44:55.414 --> 01:44:58.750
<i>she'll have 70,000 data points
defining her,</i>

01:44:58.917 --> 01:45:01.295
<i>and currently she has no rights,</i>

01:45:01.628 --> 01:45:03.839
<i>no control over that at all.</i>

01:45:06.216 --> 01:45:07.551
<i>But the battle continues.</i>

01:45:13.432 --> 01:45:15.100
I don't have to tell you

01:45:15.183 --> 01:45:17.102
that there is this dark undertow

01:45:17.185 --> 01:45:19.563
which is connecting us all globally.

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:23.567
And it is flowing
via the technology platforms.

01:45:24.026 --> 01:45:26.236
And that is why I am here

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:31.450
to address you directly,
the Gods of Silicon Valley.

01:45:35.245 --> 01:45:36.997
Mark Zuckerberg,

01:45:38.206 --> 01:45:40.000
and Sheryl Sandberg,

01:45:40.083 --> 01:45:43.170
and Larry Page, and Sergey Brin,

01:45:43.253 --> 01:45:44.671
and Jack Dorsey.

01:45:46.381 --> 01:45:49.301
Because you set out to connect people

01:45:49.801 --> 01:45:51.803
and you are refusing to acknowledge

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:55.682
that this same technology
is now driving us apart.

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:59.478
And what you don't seem to understand

01:45:59.561 --> 01:46:03.357
is that this is bigger than you,
and it's bigger than any of us.

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.779
And it is not about left or right,
or leave or remain, or Trump or not.

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:11.281
It's about whether it's actually possible

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.742
to have a free and fair election
ever again.

01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:18.038
And so my question to you is:
Is this what you want?

01:46:19.247 --> 01:46:22.209
Is this how you want history
to remember you?

01:46:23.293 --> 01:46:26.922
As the handmaidens to authoritarianism?

01:46:27.464 --> 01:46:31.510
And my question to everybody else is,
is this what we want?

01:46:31.968 --> 01:46:36.181
To sit back and play with our phones
as this darkness falls?

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:44.272
Who is logged into Facebook right now?

01:46:46.274 --> 01:46:47.359
Almost everybody.

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.779
So, as individuals,

01:46:50.862 --> 01:46:55.534
we can limit the flood of data
that we're leaking all over the place.

01:46:55.617 --> 01:46:59.496
But there's no silver bullet.
There's no way to go off the grid.

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:02.207
So, you have to understand

01:47:02.874 --> 01:47:05.877
how your data is affecting your life.

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:10.841
Our dignity as humans is at stake.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:22.314
<i>But the hardest part in all of this...</i>

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:25.355
<i>Got a lot of rough people
in those caravans. They are not a...</i>

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:27.899
<i>...is that these wreckage sites...</i>

01:47:27.983 --> 01:47:31.069
<i>...and crippling divisions...</i>

01:47:33.989 --> 01:47:37.742
<i>begin with the manipulation
of one individual.</i>

01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:40.537
<i>Then another.</i>

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:43.248
<i>And another.</i>

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:50.213
<i>So, I can't help but ask myself:</i>

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:53.758
<i>Can I be manipulated?</i>

01:47:57.387 --> 01:47:58.388
<i>Can you?</i>
