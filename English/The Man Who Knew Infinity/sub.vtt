00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.643
I have to form myself,
as I have never really formed before,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.805
and try to help you to form
some sort of reasoned estimate

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.010
of the most romantic figure
in the recent history of mathematics.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.806
Ramanujan was an Indian,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.605
and I suppose
that it is always a little difficult

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.890
for an Englishman and an Indian
to understand one another properly.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.400
I owe more to him
than to anyone else in the world,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.691
and my association with him
is the one romantic incident of my life.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.970
He was, in a way, my discovery.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.085
I did not invent him.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.643
Like other great men, he invented himself.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.605
The difficulty for me, then,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.321
is not that I do not know
enough about him,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.768
but that I know and feel too much.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.248
You can also see I've been conducting
my own mathematical researches.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.127
You've no degree. You're unemployable.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.682
I'll write you a recommendation.
Maybe someone...

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.650
With all due respect, sir,
I have recommendations.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.411
What I need is a job.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.005
- Please. I have a wife.
- You people are all the same.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.082
Now get out. Now!

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.289
I'm doomed, like Galileo.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.725
He died in poverty, you know.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.121
At least you hold yourself in good esteem.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.483
Whatever is written in your fate
will happen. You can't change that.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.722
My fate is to have a wife
who lives with my mother

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.010
while I sleep here with you all because
the British think I'm a raving lunatic.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.971
As do we Indians.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.645
Where did you get your degree?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.245
I don't have one.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.888
- How many do you have?
- None.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.445
- Who else have you shown this to?
- Everyone.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.002
The British. The Indians.
They all send me to someone else.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.570
I can offer you a job,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.049
but your evenings will have to be spent
in helping me understand this.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.560
A job?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.849
- Do we have an agreement?
- Yes.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.403
- Most certainly, sir.
- Good.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.645
Send for your wife so you can be together.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.131
And put this on.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.365
Follow me.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.645
Sir Francis, here are today's ledgers.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.529
And our new clerk.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.201
Narayana, how long have you worked for me?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.125
Since I helped to design
the bridge on the Godavari,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.090
which now requires me to call you "Sir".

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.885
Sir Francis.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.281
This man looks as if
he lives on the streets.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.601
- Get him out of here.
- Sir, please.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.765
Forgive my appearance, but I really am
quite exceptional with numbers.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.842
What you might see now is ordinary glass,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.083
I promise you will soon remain
to see a diamond.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.246
Well...

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.926
Your accounts had better be
half as polished as your ego.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.008
Amma, this is it.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.282
It's the best I could do for now.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.291
It's a home.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.326
Please.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.250
Where is the kitchen?

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.291
It's inside.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.686
From the wedding.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.284
Don't worry. I will sleep on the floor.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.044
I'm used to it.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.927
I have to go back to work now.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.722
Why aren't you using the abacus?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.090
It was faster in my head.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.246
Impressive.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.882
If Sir Francis comes here,
at least pretend to use this.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.483
I see you've been working
on your own formulas.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.282
Paper is a precious commodity here.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.886
You'll find plenty of packing
down at the docks.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.130
Thank you, sir.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.765
See you tonight.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.804
Ramanujan,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.760
we need to seek an audience with someone

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.286
who really understands all this.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.287
I've been to everyone in Madras.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.960
Madras.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.764
Did you know that the name
derives from Mandarajya?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.481
"The realm of the stupid."

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.806
There's a whole world out there.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.729
And there's England.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.200
You don't come home.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.203
It is I who owe the apology
for keeping him.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.486
I think it's enough
for tonight, Ramanujan.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.805
I'm sorry.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.127
I was told you love numbers
more than people.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.641
Some.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.407
Not you.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.246
Perhaps we can start over.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.367
I am Ramanujan.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.449
And I am your wife.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.645
Go ahead. You can look.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.360
Please.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.363
What does it all do?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.246
It's like a painting, I think.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.728
Only imagine it is with
colors you cannot see.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.530
What good is that?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.441
Not much for you, I'm afraid.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.126
But for me it is everything.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:53.649
Maybe there is someone else who can
see and understand it as well.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.761
And for them it will be important.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.130
Have you met them?

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.210
No. Not yet.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.845
I want to understand
more than just colors I can't see.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.731
What do you see?

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.364
- Sand.
- Yes.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.444
Imagine, if we could look so closely,
we could see each grain,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.964
each particle.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.282
You see, there are...
There are patterns in everything.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.089
The color in light.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.763
The reflections on water.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.645
In maths, these patterns reveal themselves

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.563
in the most incredible form.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.963
It's quite beautiful.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.125
You should sleep in the bed.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.845
Amma.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.331
I have made a friend in my boss.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.528
He's going to find somebody
to understand my work outside Madras.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.641
- Outside India.
- That is an honor.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.689
What nonsense are you talking?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.687
Amma, he sees something in me.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.285
He surely sees enough of you.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.442
You're never here at home.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.443
Kanna, we are Brahmins.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.169
It is forbidden to cross the seas.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.691
Ramanujan?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.362
Ramanujan, listen to me.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.240
This work is too important
to die with you.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.129
It must be published.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.282
If you, an Indian,
are at the pinnacle with these formulas,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.204
then the British,
even while they subjugate us,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.602
must recognize
that our brightest matches theirs.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.170
Anna, please.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.001
I can't.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.688
You have been alone in your mind
your whole life.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.440
Now other people have the chance
to understand you.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.010
Not just your Namagiri.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.851
- Imagine.
- All I do is imagine.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.767
These first two letters...

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.880
Baker.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.246
Hobson.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.965
And who's this?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.931
That's... That's Hardy.
He's a real pot stirrer.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.122
You know, he single-handedly reformed
the entire Tripos examination system.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.284
Turned over hundreds of years of history.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.930
He's your man.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.090
Trinity?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.602
Kings, prime ministers.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.002
Isaac Newton. Byron.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.604
Now perhaps even you.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.368
Trouble on the Continent?

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.883
There will be.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.245
We beat the Frogs by a goal at Twickenham.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.084
I meant in the Balkans.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.565
The Balkans.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.008
You've got one there
seems particularly well traveled.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.327
Do you think it's another hoax?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:27.085
"I beg to introduce myself
as a clerk in the Accounts Department."

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.285
- What this time?
- Quite impressive, really.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.488
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.964
A Hindu clerk!

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.565
And who claims he can give meaning

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.564
to the negative values
of the gamma function.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.882
- Littlewood?
- Without doubt.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.249
You know, Littlewood,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.885
this year alone,
I've received correspondence

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.165
from those who profess

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.125
to prove the prophetic wisdom
of the Pyramids,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.522
the revelations of the Elders of Zion,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.322
and the cryptograms,
which Bacon supposedly buried

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.205
within the plays
of the so-called Shakespeare.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.605
But a letter from
an ill-educated Indian clerk in Madras,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.969
challenging assertions I made in the
tracts series, really takes the biscuit.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.249
Well, I have to say,
I've made similar assertions myself.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.051
So you admit it?

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.641
But this was three years ago.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.327
No, no, no. I'm talking about the letter.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.965
Bloody brilliant, I thought. I don't know
where you got the postmark.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.884
Almost had me fooled.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.164
I simply don't know
what you're talking about.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.083
Come on. I'm not a complete idiot.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.365
I don't know how to get this
into your thick skull,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.330
but whatever it is you're talking about,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.808
I'm simply not involved.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.686
Play.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.647
Sir.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.964
You've missed Hall.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.405
Not hungry.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.130
I tell you, there is a war coming,
no doubt about it.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.885
Because we are being led
like mindless, spineless sheep

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.725
and no one bothers to question any of it.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.122
It's coming, all right. You can smell it.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.885
You're as paranoid as Hardy.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.405
With all due respect, Bertie,
you couldn't hold a candle.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.289
Littlewood, could I have a word?

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.645
Yes, of course.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.205
Integrals.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.566
Infinite series.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.649
God knows what else.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.485
Excuse me.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.605
I always forget
you don't believe in a supreme being.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.725
Right.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.925
If this chap turns out to be genuine,
you might have to reconsider.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.325
He must be genuine.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.925
Who would have the imagination
to invent all that?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.367
Well, I'm rather flattered
you thought I did.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.081
These two infinite series
are the more intriguing.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.924
Yeah. They defeated me completely.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.445
I've never seen anything like them.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.170
Well, it's deceptive.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.690
I'll wager the hypergeometric series.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.768
Our great Littlewood, stumped.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.648
He's Hobbs class, I'd say.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.240
"Being inexperienced, I would very
highly value any advice you give me.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.210
"Yours truly, S. Ramanujan."

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.202
- What does the "S" stand for?
- You can ask him yourself.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.848
- You intend to invite him here?
- Well, no, no, no, no, no.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.045
Much better, let him rot away
in his office in Madras?

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.845
Mr. Ramanujan.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.125
There seems to be a letter for you.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.010
Postmarked England. Cambridge, England.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.331
From a Mr. G. H. Hardy.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.091
I used to come here
and watch the boats leaving.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.721
I always wondered what it would be like
to be on one of them.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.409
I'm finally here
and you talk of crossing the sea?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.643
It is forbidden for us.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.969
I don't understand.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.651
If you go, it will never be the same.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.328
This is not Calcutta or Bombay.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.165
No one will marry our children.
No one will even talk to us!

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.925
Then we will move to Calcutta or Bombay.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.643
Besides, I don't want to
talk to anyone but you.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.689
Do you promise to bring me
as soon as you are able?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.447
Yes.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.121
Then that is what we will do.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.006
Are you sure you want me to do it?

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.320
Cut it.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.605
You cut your hair.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.364
What have you done?

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.887
Amma, I've decided to go to England.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.965
Did you?

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.728
Or did she convince you? So that both
of you could run away together?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.682
This is all her doing.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.202
She wants you all to herself.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.010
Please look after each other
while I'm gone.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.368
Never forget your prayers.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.761
You cannot pollute yourself
with their food,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.411
if you ever want to come back.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.203
Don't forget me.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.850
I could never.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.965
I promise.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.164
Well, off we go.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.684
6,000 miles. Can you imagine?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.682
I've known larger numbers.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.605
Don't let it ruin your big day
with Gunga Din.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.364
I'm sure it won't mean war.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.520
All this Din, Din, Din.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.122
Are you Ramanujan, by chance?

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.804
Very much by chance.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.443
Hello. Sorry.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.801
John Littlewood. Such a pleasure.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.281
I was just on my way to meet you.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.562
Well, shall we go together?

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.486
Yes.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.244
The intended effect.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.609
Don't be intimidated.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.881
Great knowledge often comes
from the humblest of origins.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.405
Come along.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.611
You see that sapling?

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.201
That's the very tree
under which Newton sat,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.762
when the apple dropped on his head
and he invented gravity.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.680
This way. We've been anticipating
your arrival for some time.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.485
Well, I think it's criminal.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.643
I mean, we bring these Indians over at
great expense and look what happens.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.281
Yeah, well, it's not just
that this chap is Ramjin,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.567
whatever his name is, is Indian.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.366
After all,
we do have Indian students here.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.885
Just not ones
with no education to speak of.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.685
It's a disgrace.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.001
Ramanujan is a special case.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.965
Why is that, exactly?

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.525
We've all read his letter.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.443
There are no proofs.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.008
Are we just supposed
to take him at his word?

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.841
No.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.970
You're to take him at mine.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.764
Change, gentlemen.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.525
It's a wonderful thing.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.806
Embrace it.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.129
Take it as a sign of respect
to quieten this lot.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.924
Is Mr. Hardy here?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.122
I'm most excited to meet him.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.363
He must be a very kind man
to bring me all this way.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.450
Speak of the devil.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.280
Hello.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.401
I'm Hardy.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.646
Welcome to Trinity, Mr. Ramanujan.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.527
- Am I pronouncing that properly?
- Yes, sir.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.001
Perfectly.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.089
It's an honor, sir.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.885
Thank you.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.445
I very much look forward
to beginning our work.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.851
So, tomorrow, 10:00, my rooms.
I look forward to it.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.849
Did I say something wrong?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.320
Don't worry.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.451
I'll look out for you.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.961
That's if you believe he actually exists.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.285
You see, there's speculation
that Mr. Littlewood here

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.569
is merely a figment
of Hardy's imagination.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.003
If he ever makes a mistake,
he'll have someone else to blame.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.850
Ramanujan, Bertrand Russell.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.765
- Welcome to our little asylum.
- Hello.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.683
Come along, come along.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.964
Get off the grass!

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.891
It's for Fellows only!

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.243
Excuse me, sir.
Could you direct me to New Court?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.649
- To Mr. Hardy?
- Through there.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.329
You have something on your forehead.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.611
Thank you.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.121
The shoes, they hurt my feet.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.810
Sorry I'm late.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.243
You see, you do exist.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.766
Yes.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.286
Right.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.003
Ramanujan, we've decided that
for the good of everybody

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.526
you should attend some lectures.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.449
But I'm here to publish.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.326
Yes. All in good time, I hope.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.451
But first we need proofs of your work.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.046
It's really nothing to worry about.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.085
It's simply a question of acquainting you
with the more formal methods

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.885
that will benefit our future work together.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.689
I mean, we need a common language.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.125
You wouldn't expect us to converse
with you in Tamil.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.363
No. But you expect me to speak English.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.201
Quite.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.728
So, there will be plenty of time
for publishing.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.209
I'm sorry, but with all humility,
how does anyone know that?

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.202
I don't want this to die with me.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.041
I assure you it won't.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.883
Thank you, sir.
But I have much more to share with you.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.565
As I told you, the letter only contained
a small sampling of my discoveries.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.642
You'll see I have even found a function

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.963
which exactly represents the number
of prime numbers less than X

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.963
in the form of an infinite series.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.885
- Exactly?
- Yes.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.284
I thought if we were going to publish,
it should be something ground-breaking.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.049
This is most unexpected.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.446
Hardy. This will take a lifetime.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.131
Maybe two.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.130
It's quite alarming to see you
so thoroughly pleased with yourself.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.568
Can't have anything to do
with these notebooks, can it?

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.805
You could spend the rest of your life
trying to prove half of it

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.406
and never have
another original idea of your own.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.926
Bertie.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.203
If I could prove, by logic,
that you are gonna die in five minutes,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.005
I'd be sorry,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.401
but my sorrow would be very much mitigated

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.324
by the pleasure in the proof.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.530
Might get your wish granted
with half the Continent up in flames

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.007
and old men like that running the show.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.161
No.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.802
No, you're just a bit sore because you're
worried he'll be up there before you are.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.125
I doubt a dark face
will ever grace these walls,

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.089
let alone become a Fellow.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.688
Ramanujan! Over here!

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.931
Come over, sit with us.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.445
Welcome to Hall.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.806
- I'm Chandra Mahalanobis.
- Hello.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.081
And this is Andrew Hartley.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.366
I am Ramanujan.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.489
Well, everyone knows who you are, mate.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.128
Word's out you've taken on
the prime number theorem.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.887
It is quite extraordinary,
them bringing you here like this.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.205
Such an honor.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.044
There are other Indians?

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.361
A few. You're from the South?

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.804
Calcutta myself.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.848
This must be quite a shock for you.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.487
Truth is, you've more in common
than you think.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.125
His father was a schoolteacher.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.005
Not exactly Trinity stock.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.684
Hardy's earned it on his own merits.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.485
It's probably why he's taken to you.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.564
- Does he have a wife?
- No.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.085
He's married to his work, as they say.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.571
I suppose that means you now.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.284
- Stop. He's a vegetarian.
- Very sorry.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.250
Potatoes, sir.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.241
How's that any better?

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.561
The potatoes are cooked in lard.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.568
- I'm so sorry.
- Not at all.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.084
But... But I think I will go.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.010
I hope to see you soon.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.451
Ramanujan.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.968
Did you have a good dinner?

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.446
- They make a fine mutton.
- Yes, sir.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.405
Delicious.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.760
And your... Your rooms?

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.925
Satisfactory?

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.961
I want everything to be to your advantage

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.089
so that we can be
as productive as possible.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.686
Thank you, sir.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.610
Very nice paper.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.166
Well...

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.489
Use it wisely.

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.810
Well, I'll say good night, then.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.603
All right. Now...

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.405
You. Are you following this?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.845
Yes, sir. Most excitedly.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.245
But you don't appear to be
taking any notes.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.004
Is there something
you'd like to contribute?

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.325
Well, come on, then.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.331
Come on!

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.370
You'll need the chalk.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.562
But I... I hadn't completed that proof.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.046
How do you know?

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.804
I don't know.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.211
I just do.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.241
Well, gentlemen,
it appears that our time is up.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.004
Thank you for your attention.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.406
Not you.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.208
Little wog, let me tell you something.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.246
You don't pull a stunt like that
in my class.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.885
You don't belong here and you can tell
your Master Hardy I said as much!

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.450
Now, get out!

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.170
My sacred thread.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.526
It's to help ward off evil spirits.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.447
How did it work with Mr. Howard?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.965
I'm sorry, sir.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.290
I got too excited.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.930
Not a word often associated
with his lectures.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.048
How did you know that theorem?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.490
It came to me.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.688
Mr. Hardy, I don't understand why
we waste our time

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.370
doing all these proofs.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.484
I have the formulas.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.445
It's not that I can't see
what you've claimed.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.364
It's that I'm not sure that you know
how you got there

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.008
or, indeed, that your claims are correct.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.004
There are subtleties which...

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.570
But they are right, sir.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.725
I have more important new ideas.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.441
Yes, but intuition is not enough.
It has to be held accountable.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.330
And a little humility would go a long way.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.051
Why do you think they want us to fail?

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.485
Because I am Indian.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.562
Well, yeah, there is that.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.245
But also because of what we represent.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.285
Now, Euler and Jacobi. Who are they?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.886
- Mathematicians.
- Just names to you.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.483
Euler was the most productive
mathematician of the 18th century.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.562
Most of his work done after he was blind.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.765
Jacobi, like you,
was snatched from obscurity,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.161
and was almost as impressive as Euler.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.440
Now, I think you are in their class.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.242
What they had in common,
what I see in you, is a love of form.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.243
It's all through your notebooks.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.766
Let me ask you something.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.682
Why do you do it, any of this?

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.202
Because I have to. I see it.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.011
Like Euler. Form for its own sake.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.769
An art unto itself.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.691
And, like all art, it reflects truth.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.530
It's the only truth I know. It's my church.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.165
And you, just as Mozart could hear
an entire symphony in his head,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.123
you dance with numbers to infinity.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.325
But this dance, this art, does little
to endear us to certain factions

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.205
who see us as mere conjurors.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.365
So if we are going to challenge areas
of mathematics that are so well trod,

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.647
we cannot afford to be wrong.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.883
I need you to attend your lectures,
don't offend your professors,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.405
and keep doing your proofs,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.529
otherwise this experiment of ours
will be doomed to failure.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.251
Come with me.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.008
I wanna show you something.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.085
There are many ways to be honored in life.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.929
For us, being elected a Fellow
is certainly one,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.366
but in my humble opinion,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:40.368
to leave a legacy,
here at the Wren after we're gone,

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.050
is the greatest.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.366
This library houses
the Epistles of Saint Paul,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.683
the poems of Milton,

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.210
Morgan's Bible.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.003
But in my estimation, as a man of numbers,

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:03.883
the pièce de résistance
is Newton's Principia Mathematica.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.963
Now, just as Newton represents
the physical aspect of our work,

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.691
your notebooks represent the abstract.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.445
Took a long time for Newton to be proved.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.405
Which is why we have an obligation
to prove these.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.007
And if we do, I believe that one day...

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.611
One day these notebooks
will find their place here.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.450
Now, do you understand
what's at stake here?

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.521
Good.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.481
I hope you are taking care of yourself
and that Mr. Hardy is good to you.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.045
Everyone here is so proud of you.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.687
But most proud of all is me.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.202
I spend every day missing you,

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.325
and waiting for your letter to tell me

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.290
I'm coming to be with you
across the ocean.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.369
You are my everything.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.206
I've discovered a new series.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.765
Look, I'm not interested in a new series.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.003
I thought I'd explained this.
I need your proofs.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.366
We had an agreement.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.848
Just, please, look at it, sir. It is true.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.805
- How do you know that?
- Because it is written.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.609
Written where, Ramanujan?

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.404
Now, take my coat, go home and get
properly dressed before you freeze.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.125
Sir, I've come a very long way to be here.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.885
And you promised to help me publish.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.122
Don't look at me like that.
It's for his own good.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.722
You wouldn't think he's so bloody smart
by the way he dresses.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.807
What the devil is that, anyway?

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.845
Partitions.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.370
No, no, no, wait.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.209
This even you could understand.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.084
P of 4 equals 5.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.885
Now, all that means is there are
five ways to add up the number 4.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.122
1 + 1 + 1 + 1,

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.565
3 + 1,

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.564
2 + 1 + 1,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.166
2 + 2, and 4.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.011
Seems simple enough.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.365
Yeah. So it does.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.444
But when you raise the number of P to 100,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.166
there are 204,226 different combinations.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.129
Major MacMahon did it by hand.
Took him weeks.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.130
And now he thinks
he can figure out a formula.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.923
Plug in the number, any number,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.288
and out comes the number of partitions.
Like magic.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.925
I take it you have tried
to crack this one before?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.890
It's considered impossible. Unsolvable.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.210
A bloody rabbit hole mystery
of the universe.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.401
Until now?

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.370
"Din! Din! Din! Gunga Din."

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.611
So, using the divergence theorem,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.570
what is the flux of F through S here?

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.690
What on earth's he doing?

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.889
- Proofs. Yeah.
- Proofs?

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.521
You should let him run, Hardy.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.809
You shouldn't stifle him.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.763
He's gone to the cricket.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.207
Just follow the umbrella.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.046
Sir!

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.811
Mr. Hardy!

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.805
Mr. Hardy.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.923
I've been over those proofs of yours,
if you can call them that, very carefully.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.284
And I've marked where you're missing steps

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.283
and where you've made mistakes.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.211
There's much more I could say,
but that's where you should begin.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.205
Listen, I'm hard on you
for your own benefit.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.965
- So that you can be published.
- But, sir, you can publish the notebooks

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.122
and my prime number theorem.
You've had them since I arrived.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.205
There is nothing I'd like more.
But, if I was to publish them

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.165
in their present state,
I'd be sent to the lunatic asylum.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.322
You don't understand. These...

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.165
I don't think about this
the same way you do.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.083
These steps you want, what you want,

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.285
I do not know how to do.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.485
Well, you can just begin
by trying your best

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.801
and see if you don't surprise yourself.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.010
- Sir, do you know something I don't?
- Apparently not.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.763
No, God and I
don't see exactly eye to eye.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.565
So if I prepare for rain, then it won't.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.885
So far, so good.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.405
I'm Hardy and I'm spending
the afternoon in the Wren Library.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.642
Now we're sure to have sunshine.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.644
You see, I'm what you call an atheist.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.961
No, sir. You believe in God.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.168
You just don't think He likes you.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.006
Really?

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.326
Listen.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.642
I wasn't gonna give you this just yet,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:33.011
but I took the liberty
of doing some of your proofs myself.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.844
Just to show you what together
we can achieve.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.606
See?

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.129
You've been published.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.810
Mr. Hardy, thank you!

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.525
Thank you, sir!

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.566
It is with great pride
that today all of us have shared

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:17.370
the publication of my son's article
in the London Mathematical Society.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.887
Such a big thing.
A very prestigious society.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.285
So how really is the little genius?

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.245
Don't pay attention to her.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.130
She's not proud enough
of his achievements.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.085
Ramanujan?

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.765
Wake up. It just came over the wire.
We're at war.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.922
- Here?
- No, silly, Belgium.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.241
Now, come on! The King's arriving!

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.804
God save the King!

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.844
Bloody jingoes.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.965
Bertie's asked me to help him

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.405
with his Union of Democratic Control
or something.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.165
- Agitating already?
- Well...

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.049
Well, I received a letter
from the War Office this morning.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.763
Seems they need some assistance
with ballistics.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.405
- Ballistics? You?
- I know.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.324
I did try to explain,
but they're rather a dense lot.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.442
- Yeah.
- Anyway, you probably won't miss me.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.444
There's an ongoing theory that I'm
merely a figment of your imagination.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.204
That's not true.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.129
Ramanujan's out there.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.531
There's a reason
he doesn't like proofs, you know.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.844
They may be disagreeable to his formulas.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.446
- God save the King!
- How do you mean?

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.605
Well, I've been having some
reservations about some of his work.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.762
Well, what did you expect?

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.049
He may belong to a world beyond us,
but he's not God.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.003
Well, that's a relief.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.766
He's not.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.645
How will Janaki ever come now?

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.849
Don't worry.
They say it'll be over by Christmas.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.891
Please finish by telling him
that, of course, I will come

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.007
and not to worry about the war.
It is far away from here.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.401
And that I will wait for him to make
the necessary arrangements.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.969
Also that I love him very much.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.486
That is all.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.846
Make your mark here.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.969
I knew your husband.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.682
But he spent all the time at the temple.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.920
He's still there in the alcove.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.246
Amma?

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.530
Amma, please, would you post this for him?

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.650
He needs to know
I will still come with the war.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.247
Amma, please let me help you.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.168
- Where are all the vegetables?
- Rationing for the war.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.804
And some... Thank you.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.450
There is no letter for you.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.725
Please, can you check again?

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.404
I already looked again.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.365
Now, you're holding up the queue.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.442
His mum forgot to write him.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.046
Look who it is, the genius wog!

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.962
Can you believe they send us off
while he kips here in luxury?

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.645
Where do you think you're going?

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.605
You freeloading little blackie.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.125
Hey. Hey.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.964
I'm talking to you.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.121
Hey.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.009
This is our home.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.884
Don't you forget it.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.249
Victory at any price?

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.010
Victory for whom?

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.004
I understand it's inevitable

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.645
that anybody primarily interested in peace

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.520
should be unpopular in a time of war.

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.965
But perhaps that is all the more reason
that we should exist.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.042
Hear, hear.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.370
Mr. Littlewood has very kindly
offered us his rooms

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.121
while he is away solving
the intricacies of ballistics

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.727
for which he is so ill-suited.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.360
So please keep your hands off my books.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.681
By that he means his whiskey collection.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.844
Thank you all very much for coming.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.684
Bless you.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.531
Thank you so much. Thank you for coming.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.690
Bloody cheek!

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.808
...were so fast and ours were in
completely the wrong position.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.249
What is the meaning of this?

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.961
I'd have thought
you'd choose your battles more wisely.

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.005
After all, it's only the goodwill
of the college that allows Ramujin here.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.641
What the bloody hell does the UDC
have to do with Ramanujan?

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.564
You should know that your friend,
Russell, is going to lose his lectureship

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.365
as a result of the leaflets
he's been distributing.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.046
We have heard that others
are doing the same.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.605
Are you threatening me?

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:07.321
Mr. Howard is simply trying
to enlighten you

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.768
as to the precariousness
of your situation.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.965
You are perfectly at liberty to take
the matter to the College Council.

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.288
Well, rest assured, I shall, on principle.

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.805
Well, that's a rather dangerous word,

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.360
with all your liberal colleagues
in France.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.565
Change, Hardy. That's what you wanted.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.409
Now you get used to it.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.042
From Mr. Littlewood, sir.

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.805
If I may,
he's so misplaced on a battlefield,

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.009
I shouldn't think a bullet
would recognize him as a target.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.044
Damn you, Littlewood.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.602
My dear Harold, please forgive
this personal transgression.

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.323
I'm gone now to this god-awful war

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.649
and haven't the faintest idea
if I will ever return.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:22.491
Fortunately, unlike you,
I do have God to take comfort in.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.123
I have two points to make.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.125
The first is that
Ramanujan's work on primes,

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.602
while brilliant in itself, is actually wrong.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.961
The other point is less straightforward.

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:40.687
You have in Ramanujan
nothing short of a miracle.

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.845
The man exceeds any notion of brilliance

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.888
that I have ever understood.

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.008
Forget Jacobi,
we can compare him with Newton.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.605
I have come to believe that for Ramanujan,

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:57.651
every single positive integer
is one of his personal friends.

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.767
And, to that end,
you, too, have a responsibility.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.924
You have to look after him

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.844
and make sure that his work
amounts to something.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.362
Don't let Howard and his lot win.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.167
So, you see, Hardy,
you, too, have a war to fight.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.966
Just don't let it be with Ramanujan.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.288
So, there you have it.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.802
He left this for you to see for yourself.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.567
Your theorem on primes is wrong.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.801
- It's not. It can't be.
- It's rather interesting, really.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.645
If you compare
the prime number approximation

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.045
with the actual number of primes,

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.085
- the calculation tells us what?
- It always moves higher.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.731
Even at a thousand? A million?

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.404
A billion trillion?

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.801
Yes?

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.445
- Where is the proof?
- I gave it to you. It proves it.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.603
No, because however
intuitively obvious it may seem,

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.160
when subject to calculation, it fails.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.322
Mr. Littlewood has calculated a number

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.525
and it shows that your theorem
will sometimes predict less,

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.045
not more,
than the actual number of primes.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.009
Your theorem is wrong.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.405
And this is why we cannot publish any more

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.525
until you finally trust me
on this business of proofs.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.924
- Intuition can only carry you so far.
- Stop!

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.607
I... I can't hear this anymore.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.205
Intuition?

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.442
You say this word as if it is nothing.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.285
Is that all it is to you? All that I am?

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.567
Look, I'm sorry.
Am I... I'm missing something.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.810
You've... You've never even seen me,
let alone know me.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.440
You... You are a man of no faith!

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.284
I don't see pictures of anyone here!

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.283
Not even family! Who are you, Mr. Hardy?

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.930
How dare you...

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.965
How dare you judge me?

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.963
But it is you who does of me!
Don't you see?

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.606
No.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.209
Quite frankly, I don't.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.642
Don't you know
what I've given up to be here?

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.650
I have nothing.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.486
Do you even see the bruises on my face?

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.482
I have a wife, Mr. Hardy.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.400
At last.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.247
Ramanujan? Is that you?

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.251
Mr. Hardy.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.091
You're not well?

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.920
Nothing serious.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.366
Sure?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.362
I'm just off to the Wren.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.241
Believe it or not,

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.887
if you can find your way round the beds,
there are still some books there.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.168
Those proofs you left...

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.125
Wonderful.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.440
Really wonderful.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.847
So, we start work again?

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.164
Tomorrow morning?

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.804
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.369
- My regards to your fine wife.
- Thank you so much.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.491
Good day, gentlemen.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.290
I'm very sorry, sir.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.325
He was a fine young man.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.728
- Best... Best of his year.
- They were all fine young men.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.485
All the knowledge they gained here.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.404
Sacrificed for a few yards of land.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.846
They say it's the price of victory.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.324
Come, Bertie.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.765
I'm worried about Ramanujan.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.086
Why?

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.527
Well, he doesn't seem quite himself.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.368
What would you know about that?

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.770
Very little, I admit.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.531
But I don't think he's well.
He seems to have changed.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.603
We had a terrible row the other night

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.725
about intuition, of all things,
and he stormed out.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.361
And then a day later,
he produces these wonderful proofs.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.045
Well, Harold, you've got your way.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.690
How do you mean?

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.167
You and your damned rigor
has finally broken his spirits.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.322
I warned you to let him run.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.805
Yeah, well, he's not a bloody racehorse.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.881
No, he's not.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.281
But as you've hardly treated him
as a human being, I suppose...

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.043
Well, I suppose a horse
isn't a bad place to start.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.442
Major, can I have a word?

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.443
I don't have time for you!

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.365
Partitions!

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.650
It's Ramanujan.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.646
The gall.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.486
The unbridled arrogance.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.284
He won't be able to do it without you.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.926
He won't be able to do it at all.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.929
I've been going over
your work on partitions.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.128
Seems to me you're on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.963
So now you've begun
to embrace some proper rigor,

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.161
I think you should meet Major MacMahon.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.244
He's the leader in combinatorics
at the University,

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.842
and also happens to be
one of your most vocal opponents.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.241
He says partitions can't be done.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.487
Especially by the likes of you.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.571
Then he better start counting very high.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.963
Enter at your own risk!

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.203
I've been waiting for you.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.167
Square root of 58,639? Now!

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.201
242.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.361
242 what?

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.329
Point 1549090.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.689
Yes, child's play. Try me.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.241
Go on.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.926
Same number squared.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.565
3,438,532,321.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.645
Thrashed ya!

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.605
Combinatorics, that's what I do.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.409
Glorified dice throwing.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.481
Bloody nerve of you both.

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.085
You fail on primes, then you think

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.925
you can just turn round
and crack partitions?

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.765
Can't be done, I'm telling you.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.888
Especially not by you.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.001
It can.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.846
And I will.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.206
No, I will.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.801
By hand.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.169
By slow and painful addition,
and then you can be absolutely certain

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.569
that whatever formula you two
can dream up will be quite wrong.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.685
Then you can crawl back under
whatever rock you came from in India

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.889
and we can put to bed
this charade of yours, Hardy.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.609
Now, how high do I have to go?

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.809
P of 200 should do.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.930
I really can do it.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.802
Well, here we are, P of 200.
The moment of truth.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.125
You know, I was stationed in Madras once.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.326
Yeah.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.284
Well, you first.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.762
What has your formula given you?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.004
3,972,998,000,000.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.725
My God.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.250
You're close.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.691
Within 2%.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.090
Well, I'll be damned.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.967
Major MacMahon,
may I introduce you to Mr. Ramanujan.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.085
How long?

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.321
Three weeks.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.685
And the fever?

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.125
- Longer.
- Breathe in.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.806
Breathe in.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.208
Well, it's not good.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.124
You've all the early signs of tubercula.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.480
I'm sorry.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.925
You're a breeding ground for infection.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.168
I'm so sorry, Ramanujan.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.249
Hardy can never know.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.050
Run! Run!

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.450
It's a zeppelin!

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.441
Come on, Ram!

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.565
Over here!

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.484
I'm being punished.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.331
It's just the fever.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.010
Has he wrote yet?

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.761
No.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.604
Where are you going?

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.370
You forgot me.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.970
You see, you were right.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.085
Cauchy's theorem will work.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.810
It's just leading to the circle concept.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.011
At 2,000, it should bring it down to
less than 1 % or so.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.961
And as N goes to infinity,
the error goes to zero.

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.405
You see? You're beginning to see
the nuances and complexities,

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.370
which you were only catching
at a glance before.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.321
What an unlikely team we make.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.804
If we really crack partitions, this will
be a monumental breakthrough.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.521
Did I tell you I've...
I've put you up for a Fellowship?

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.525
Mr. Hardy,

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.891
thank you.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.290
Are you getting enough to eat?

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.325
I mean, I know there are shortages,

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.801
but there's still plenty
of good grub in Hall.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.961
I'm all right.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.645
It's nothing.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.729
Let me ask you something.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.651
How does all this come to you?

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.046
I don't know.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.281
Why am I bothering with a Council meeting

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.964
when I'm getting the boot?

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.362
If you think I'm gonna have
that charlatan for a Fellow,

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.124
you're very much mistaken.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.080
Please tell me you didn't propose him.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.083
He's gonna crack partitions.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.365
He's worthy.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.245
You're the one who told me
to let him run like a damn horse.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.765
Well, I did.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.844
And now I... I need to raise his spirits.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.924
You mean
you need to relieve your own guilt.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.968
Really, for someone so clever,
you can be so terribly dim.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.200
So, in the matter of Fellowship
for Srinivasa Ramanujan,

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.362
we call the matter to vote.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.447
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.886
I felt I should be the one to tell you.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.450
I'm very embarrassed,
for myself and for the College.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:11.369
But your Fellowship was denied.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.929
Thank you for telling me.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.649
I know you did all you could.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.407
Yeah, more dressings!

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.120
Can we have someone over here, please?

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.080
Nurse!

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.324
- Nurse!
- That's it, just breathe.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.040
Ramanujan?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.002
Nurse! Nurse!

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.930
Shall I wake him?

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.207
No.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.168
He'll come when he's ready.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.769
Excuse me, Doctor. This gentleman's
looking for the Indian student.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.445
Yes.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.568
He came in last night.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.125
Not right in the head.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.725
Terrible fever.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.085
He was here.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.802
Your condition has worsened.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.928
You may not have long.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.166
You should set your affairs in order.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.487
Do you have any family here?

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.926
Anyone?

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.011
No!

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.361
Sir, something's happened in London.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.002
Call me a taxi, will you?

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.883
He was very lucky with the train.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.531
The conductor saw him before he jumped.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.922
The danger is his lungs.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.565
Yes, he's had a bad cough for some time.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.765
It is no cough.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.649
He has advanced tuberculosis.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.642
Well, is... Is there nothing we could do?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.126
Pray.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.289
It will take a miracle.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.171
Mr. Hardy.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.207
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.883
Gave me quite a scare.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.724
Self-prophesying.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.481
My wife has forgotten me.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.844
I have no one.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.891
I understand that
you might feel like that,

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.528
but you should have told me.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.484
I could have helped.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.565
You know,
it just as easily could have been me.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.449
Well, I'm glad it wasn't.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.166
You have cause enough with Ramanujan.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.282
I'll be thinking of you both.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.164
Where will you go?

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.442
I'll go down the road to Oxford.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.244
And I'll wait for them
to beg to have me back here.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.524
Good-bye, Harold.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.926
Bye, Bertie.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.005
Too bad he couldn't take Hardy with him.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.401
I still don't see
what he bloody contributes.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.608
Yeah, I had words with Major MacMahon.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.963
It seems that Ramanujan's on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.762
That's right. Partitions.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.124
That's impossible.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.324
Remains to be seen.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.650
God, it's freezing in here.
Are you warm enough?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.405
Try sleeping.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.404
I have to go to that pipe
just so I don't freeze.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.445
It would have been better for all
had the train done its job.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.127
Yeah, you could have been
reincarnated as a pigeon turd.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.284
Sorry I've not been able to be a better
friend to you in the traditional sense.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.965
I know you've needed one,
but I'm not very good at all of that.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.247
I never have been.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.405
Life for me is...

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.009
It's always been mathematics.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.691
You wanted to know how I get my ideas.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.526
My God.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.121
Namagiri.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.044
She speaks to me.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.284
Puts formulas on my tongue when I sleep,

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.243
sometimes when I pray.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.724
Do you believe me?

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.207
Because if you are my friend, then you
will know that I'm telling you the truth.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.808
If you are truly my friend.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.363
But I don't believe in God.
I don't believe in anything I can't prove.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.408
Then you can't believe in me.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.649
Don't you see?

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:08.085
An equation has no meaning to me
unless it expresses a thought of God.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.083
Maybe it is better
that we just remain what we were.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.126
When I was at school,
I remember one of my chaplains saying,

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.404
"You know God exists
because He's like a kite,

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.610
"and you can feel the tug on the string
and know that He's up there."

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.767
I said, "What if there's no wind
and the kite can't fly?"

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.447
No, I... I can't believe in God.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.325
I don't believe
in the immemorial wisdom of the East,

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.482
but I do believe in you.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.286
Thank you.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.850
I very much want to finish
what we started.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.001
Good.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.721
I brought some calculations
in case you were feeling a bit better.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.165
And then I want to go home.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.801
Home?

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.564
As soon as I am able.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.245
Or if I should die, you have to promise
that you will get me home.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.163
You're not going to die.

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.250
This came for you.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.088
I'll leave you in peace.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.487
Try and do what the doctors ask.
I know it's not in your nature.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.045
I will never know
why you have chosen to forsake me.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.211
Just a letter in response

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.210
to the multitude I have sent you
would have been enough.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.406
I have gone to be with my brother
and his family where I will remain.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.560
This last letter is to say good-bye.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.722
- What happened?
- I don't know. He's a terrible patient.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.885
Doesn't believe in medicine.
Won't eat anything.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.325
Just prays to his Namagiri.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.007
Well, I'd be praying too if you were
my doctor. And I'm a bloody atheist.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.286
- This is my fault.
- Yes, maybe.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.761
We are within .004.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.921
This can't die with me, Mr. Hardy.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.603
You're not going to die.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.006
If this is correct,
you'll make a difference.

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.043
I have the proofs.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.566
My God.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.650
He did it. He really did it.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.049
Now he must be a Fellow.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.924
Be practical, Hardy.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.889
He'll only fail again.

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.441
Not with your help, he won't.

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.123
Besides, there is another way.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.925
If he was a...

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.729
If he had a Royal Fellowship...

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.604
An FRS?

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.125
He's Indian!

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.005
MacMahon, listen to me.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.003
He really needs this.

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.645
See that this gets
to Lieutenant Littlewood.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.326
Littlewood? Where?

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.442
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Baker, I have someone

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.841
who wishes to talk to you
about Mr. Ramanujan.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.411
Gentlemen.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.289
Trinity denied him.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.684
I just want the opportunity
to make the case.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.126
Try him on his merits.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.570
Suit yourself. But I think you'll find
the result will be the same.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.248
- Hardy.
- Morning.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.486
Now what have you got
yourself involved with?

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.206
John.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.889
Good of you to come.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.203
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.562
So, now we see the work on partitions

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.770
and the enormous breakthrough
that has been achieved.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.685
All this, mind you,

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.604
by a man whose limitations
of knowledge when I met him

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.889
were as startling as was its profundity.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.323
Opinions may differ as to
the importance of Ramanujan's work

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.001
and the influence it may or may not
have on the mathematics of the future,

01:31:55.080 --> 01:32:01.486
but one gift it does show is
its profound and invincible originality.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.443
Mr. Littlewood once told me

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:11.323
that "every positive integer is
one of Ramanujan's personal friends."

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.880
I believe this to be true.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.965
He told me that an equation for him
had no meaning

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.522
unless it expressed a thought of God.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:28.126
Well, despite everything in my being
set to the contrary,

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.131
perhaps he is right.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:36.051
For is this not exactly our justification
for pure mathematics?

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:42.889
We are merely explorers of infinity
in the pursuit of absolute perfection.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.362
We do not invent these formulae,
they already exist

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:52.443
and lie in wait for only the very
brightest of minds, like Ramanujan, ever

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.126
to divine and prove.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:00.721
So, in the end,
I have been forced to consider,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.891
who are we to question Ramanujan,

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.090
let alone God?

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.726
Thank you.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.609
It's bad enough that this charlatan
has wasted our time once.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.365
And now Hardy has dragged
the only person in the world

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.283
who will support him out of the trenches.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.569
No, enough is enough with this...
This Ramujin.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.685
Littlewood is not the only one.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.965
I think he has the finest mind
I've seen in my lifetime.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.122
And his name is Ramanujan.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.566
Hardy?

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:51.926
I'm a Fellow of the Royal Society.

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.291
He wrote to me.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:40.960
Janaki.

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:46.170
If you had gone to him,
he would never return.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.842
Are you really gonna go home?

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.528
War is over. It is time.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.287
Well, as a Fellow of the Royal Society,
they're gonna be really proud of you.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.249
- I owe you so much.
- No, no, no.

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.008
It's I who owe you.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.284
Come on. Come on the grass. You're late.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:37.005
But, sir, I can't.
I'm not a Fellow over here.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.003
Are you sure about that?

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.486
Well, as an FRS, what could they say?

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.165
Repeat after me.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.483
"I, Srinivas Ramanujan,

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.091
"elected Fellow of Trinity College..."

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.245
I, Srinivas Ramanujan,

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.811
elected Fellow of Trinity College...

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.765
Sorry I'm late. Bloody cab driver got lost.

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.444
Should have known from his number.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.841
- And what was that?
- Rather a dull one.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.725
- 1729.
- No, Hardy.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:40.644
It is a very interesting number.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.245
It is the smallest number expressible

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.210
as the sum of two cubes
in two different ways.

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.088
Have you notified your family?

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.842
- Just not her.
- I don't even know if she got my letter.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.122
I... I... I'm rather out of my depth
in such affairs, but...

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.970
But I will say this.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.603
There are no proofs nor underlying laws

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.968
that can determine the outcome
of matters of the heart.

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.489
Of this I'm sure.

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.768
Perhaps when we meet again
you will have such matters of your own.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.050
Well, perhaps.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.324
I will miss you, my friend.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.170
I will miss you.

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.885
So, I want a letter with you
with all your new work, every week.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.445
And come back to us in a year's time.

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.851
I promise.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.605
Afternoon post, sir.

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.045
Thank you.

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.641
India.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.131
At last.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.603
Is he coming back, sir?

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.522
It is difficult to put into words

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.400
what I owe Ramanujan.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.245
His originality has been
a constant source of suggestion to me

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.288
ever since I first met him.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.170
And his death

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.524
is one of the worst blows
I have ever felt.

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.450
But now I say to myself
when I'm depressed,

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.011
and I find myself forced to listen
to tiresome and pompous people,

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.045
"Well, I've done something
you could never have done.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:03.921
"I have collaborated
with both Littlewood and Ramanujan

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.126
"on something like equal terms."

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.569
Let's take this one.

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.166
What?

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.565
1729.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.325
I don't see what's so special
about this one.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.368
Neither did I at first.
