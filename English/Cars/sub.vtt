[Inhaling and exhaling deeply]

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.949
[Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:44.410
Speed. I am speed.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:46.037
[Cars whizzing past]

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.831
One winner, 42 losers.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.459
I eat losers for breakfast.

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:53.503
[Car accelerating]

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.004
Breakfast.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.173
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.969
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.595
[Cars whizzing]

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.889
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:06.558
I am lightning!

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:07.600
[Pounding on door]

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.978
[Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?

00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:11.563
[# Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:14.816
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:17.360
[engine revving]

[All cheer]

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.363
Get your antenna balls here!

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:52.080
Go, Lightnin'!

00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:56.167
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick. [whistles]

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:57.502
[Air wrench whirring]

- [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [Crowd cheers]

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.700
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

00:03:28.783 --> 00:03:31.786
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:33.872
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof

00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:37.542
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:38.668
Right, Darrell.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.379
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:43.548
heading into the final race
of the season.

00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:48.386
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.138
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:52.640
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:55.310
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.562
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:01.024
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:03.610
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:05.820
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.

00:04:05.904 --> 00:04:08.656
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.827
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.496
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.208
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.792
But everyone knows him now.

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:23.922
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:26.591
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:29.552
Three cars, one champion!

00:04:33.223 --> 00:04:34.515
[Breaks screeching]

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:43.191
No you don't.

- Hey!

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:53.910
- [Tires squealing]
- [Crowd booing]

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.788
What a ride!

00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:58.122
[Chuckling]

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.375
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

00:05:04.212 --> 00:05:06.047
[Female] I love you, Lightning!

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.758
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [Screaming]

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.760
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:14.055
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

00:05:14.138 --> 00:05:15.139
[Crowd gasps]

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:19.811

[Both screaming]

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:38.830
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:41.749
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.042
Not in one piece, that is.

00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:54.721
[Exhaling]

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.350
Yeah!

00:05:59.434 --> 00:06:01.394
Lightning! Oh!

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:05.773
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:08.318
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:10.486
Yeah! Ka-chow!

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.823
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.868
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:19.162
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:20.997
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.083
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.878
[Air wrench whirring]

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:31.299
[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:33.301
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:34.427
He's not pitting!

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.639
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.474
McQueen's not going into the pits!

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:43.102
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:45.480
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:47.774
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:51.236
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.696
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:59.494
[Crowd cheers]

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:13.675
Come on, come on, come on!

00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:24.185
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:26.938
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [Male] What?

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.148
You need tires, you idiot!

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.443
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

00:07:32.527 --> 00:07:33.945
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:36.698
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:40.451
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:47.083
[Cars whizzing]

00:07:48.585 --> 00:07:52.797
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:55.758
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.094
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

00:07:58.177 --> 00:08:00.388
[Crowd cheers and whistles]

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.682
[Screaming]

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:06.811
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [Tire blows]

00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:08.897
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:11.691
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:14.319
- You fool!
- [Grunts]

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.156
[Male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:19.741
Go, go, go!

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.833
- [Grunting]
- [Tire blows]

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:30.627
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.922
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:35.882
Come on. [grunting]

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:39.969
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:43.598
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:45.934
[Gasping]

00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:48.686
[Growling]

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:51.940
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:58.071
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:00.949
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.367
Lightning!

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:05.662
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:09.207
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.292
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:14.587
[Tape jittering]

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.634
[Slow motion drone]

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:25.014
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:27.308
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.433
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.894
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

00:09:29.978 --> 00:09:32.438
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

00:09:32.522 --> 00:09:33.481
Tell me about it!

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:36.234
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

00:09:36.317 --> 00:09:39.737
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:43.700
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:45.702
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:47.912
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:50.164
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:51.666
What? Oh, yeah, right.

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.793
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:56.504
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:58.256
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:00.008
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:02.093
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

00:10:02.176 --> 00:10:05.763
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:09.893
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.686
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:15.523
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:16.566
[Crowd laughs]

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.569
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:21.279
Oh, whatever.

00:10:21.362 --> 00:10:23.364
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

00:10:23.448 --> 00:10:26.743
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:29.037
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.664
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

00:10:31.748 --> 00:10:34.375
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:39.047
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

00:10:39.088 --> 00:10:40.924
In your dreams, Thunder.

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:44.093
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:47.013
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:48.890
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

00:10:48.932 --> 00:10:51.392
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:53.144
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:54.687
Right in the lens.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:57.023
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:00.401
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

00:11:00.443 --> 00:11:02.862
[Electronic music]

00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:05.615
[Crowd chattering]

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:10.161
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

because the track is always lit.

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:28.378

I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

to a new jail and let that jail rot.

I'm...

00:30:31.197 --> 00:30:33.116

00:30:52.302 --> 00:30:54.262
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

00:31:06.441 --> 00:31:09.944

they themselves don't understand.

00:31:10.028 --> 00:31:11.696

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.242
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

00:31:16.326 --> 00:31:20.121
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

00:31:34.802 --> 00:31:37.096
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

00:31:37.847 --> 00:31:38.806
You know her?

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.851
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

00:31:41.935 --> 00:31:42.936
What?

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:47.106
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.985
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

00:31:51.069 --> 00:31:52.737
What do you want, Sally?

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.157
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

00:31:56.241 --> 00:31:59.410
No. I know his type. Racecar.

00:31:59.494 --> 00:32:01.538
That's the last thing this town needs.

00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:06.125
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

00:32:06.209 --> 00:32:10.129
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

00:32:10.213 --> 00:32:11.631
Here she goes again.

00:32:11.714 --> 00:32:14.384
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:18.096
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

00:32:18.179 --> 00:32:21.975
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

00:32:22.058 --> 00:32:25.019
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

00:32:25.103 --> 00:32:26.271
Ignore him.

00:32:26.354 --> 00:32:29.691
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

00:32:29.774 --> 00:32:32.110
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

00:32:32.193 --> 00:32:34.988
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

00:32:35.071 --> 00:32:36.531
And if no one can get to you?

00:32:36.614 --> 00:32:40.952
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

00:32:41.035 --> 00:32:43.872
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

00:32:43.913 --> 00:32:47.333
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

00:32:47.417 --> 00:32:50.920
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

00:32:51.004 --> 00:32:54.507
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:57.719
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.346
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.224
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

00:33:03.308 --> 00:33:06.561
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

00:33:06.603 --> 00:33:08.855
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

00:33:08.938 --> 00:33:10.940
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

00:33:11.024 --> 00:33:12.025
Oh, he can do it.

00:33:12.108 --> 00:33:14.903
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

00:33:14.944 --> 00:33:16.446
[All] Fix the road!

00:33:16.487 --> 00:33:20.074
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

00:33:20.116 --> 00:33:21.409
[All cheer]

00:33:21.451 --> 00:33:24.662
[Honking] Order in the court!

00:33:25.455 --> 00:33:28.208
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:30.251
- [All] Yeah!
- No!

00:33:30.335 --> 00:33:31.669
[VW van] Nice ruling.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.882
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

00:33:35.965 --> 00:33:39.844
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

00:33:40.053 --> 00:33:41.763
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

00:33:41.804 --> 00:33:44.432
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

00:33:44.515 --> 00:33:47.185
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

00:33:47.268 --> 00:33:48.937
[Gurgling]

00:33:49.395 --> 00:33:53.358
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

00:33:53.441 --> 00:33:56.486
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

00:33:56.569 --> 00:33:59.280
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

00:33:59.364 --> 00:34:01.699
What? This place is crazy!

00:34:01.783 --> 00:34:03.952
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

00:34:03.993 --> 00:34:06.996
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.081
What?

00:34:08.164 --> 00:34:11.709
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

00:34:11.793 --> 00:34:13.378
You gotta be kidding me.

00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.130
You start there where the road begins.

00:34:16.506 --> 00:34:19.467
You finish down there
where the road ends.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.721
[Mater] Holy shoot!

00:34:24.264 --> 00:34:26.641
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

00:34:26.724 --> 00:34:30.311
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

00:34:30.353 --> 00:34:31.521
Five days?

00:34:31.604 --> 00:34:34.524
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

00:34:34.607 --> 00:34:37.569
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

00:34:37.652 --> 00:34:40.113
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:44.325
[Grunting]

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.871
[Tires squealing, engine rewing]

00:34:48.204 --> 00:34:50.456
[Lightning] Freedom!

00:34:55.753 --> 00:34:59.299
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:03.344
...and then...
then took the boot off.

00:35:04.846 --> 00:35:07.223
Whoo-hoo!

00:35:07.974 --> 00:35:11.978
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

00:35:12.061 --> 00:35:15.899
California, here I come! Yeah!

00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:20.278
Oh, feel that wind.

00:35:20.737 --> 00:35:22.322
Yes!

00:35:22.405 --> 00:35:23.406
[Sputtering]

00:35:23.489 --> 00:35:25.491
No. No, no, no.

00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:28.119
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

00:35:28.203 --> 00:35:30.163
How can I be outta gas?

00:35:30.246 --> 00:35:34.209
[Chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

00:35:34.292 --> 00:35:36.628
[Stuttering] But how did,
how did... you?

00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:39.047
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

00:35:39.088 --> 00:35:42.008
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:35:50.433 --> 00:35:52.810
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

00:35:52.894 --> 00:35:53.978
Hey, Sheriff.

00:35:54.062 --> 00:35:56.314
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

00:35:56.397 --> 00:35:58.858
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

00:35:58.942 --> 00:36:00.818
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

00:36:00.902 --> 00:36:03.738
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.616
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:09.410
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

00:36:09.494 --> 00:36:12.413
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

00:36:12.455 --> 00:36:15.833
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

00:36:15.917 --> 00:36:18.127
That's why we made him the judge.

00:36:18.294 --> 00:36:22.465
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:23.925
Now, I'm not one to brag

00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:27.262
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

00:36:27.762 --> 00:36:28.763
Oh!

00:36:28.846 --> 00:36:31.683
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

00:36:31.766 --> 00:36:33.560
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

00:36:33.643 --> 00:36:35.895
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:40.650
- [Snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:43.069
That won't be necessary.

00:36:44.153 --> 00:36:47.448
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.118
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

00:36:52.579 --> 00:36:53.580
Where's he goin'?

00:36:53.663 --> 00:36:57.083
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:58.668
I shouldn't put up with this.

00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:01.629
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

00:37:01.671 --> 00:37:04.716
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

00:37:05.008 --> 00:37:08.177
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

00:37:08.261 --> 00:37:10.889
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

00:37:10.972 --> 00:37:14.934
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

00:37:15.018 --> 00:37:17.312
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

00:37:17.395 --> 00:37:19.480
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

00:37:19.564 --> 00:37:21.566
I must scream it to the world!

00:37:21.649 --> 00:37:25.862
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

00:37:25.945 --> 00:37:28.448
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:31.492
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

00:37:32.243 --> 00:37:35.205
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

00:37:40.043 --> 00:37:42.629
Is that what I think it is?

00:37:44.214 --> 00:37:45.465
[Sally] Customers.

00:37:45.548 --> 00:37:48.968
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

00:37:49.052 --> 00:37:50.428
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

00:37:50.511 --> 00:37:53.348
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

00:37:53.389 --> 00:37:55.975
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:59.562
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

00:37:59.646 --> 00:38:02.315
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

00:38:02.398 --> 00:38:06.778
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:09.530
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

00:38:09.572 --> 00:38:12.575
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

00:38:12.617 --> 00:38:14.869
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

00:38:14.953 --> 00:38:15.995
How can we help you?

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:20.124
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:23.419
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

00:38:23.503 --> 00:38:25.922
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

00:38:26.005 --> 00:38:28.841
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

00:38:28.925 --> 00:38:31.970
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

00:38:32.053 --> 00:38:36.099
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

00:38:36.182 --> 00:38:37.892
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

00:38:37.934 --> 00:38:41.145
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

00:38:41.229 --> 00:38:44.566
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

00:38:44.607 --> 00:38:46.943
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

00:38:47.026 --> 00:38:49.362
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

00:38:49.445 --> 00:38:52.574
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

00:38:52.657 --> 00:38:56.411
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

00:38:56.452 --> 00:38:59.914
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

00:38:59.998 --> 00:39:03.918
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

00:39:04.002 --> 00:39:05.169
No we just topped off.

00:39:05.253 --> 00:39:09.090
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

00:39:09.173 --> 00:39:11.634
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

00:39:11.718 --> 00:39:15.054
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

00:39:15.138 --> 00:39:18.266
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:20.643
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

00:39:20.727 --> 00:39:22.061
Maybe ghost flames!

00:39:22.145 --> 00:39:24.689
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

00:39:24.772 --> 00:39:28.651
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

00:39:28.735 --> 00:39:31.738
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:33.323
Ow!

00:39:33.406 --> 00:39:36.618
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

00:39:36.826 --> 00:39:38.953
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

00:39:38.995 --> 00:39:42.498
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:46.169
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

00:39:46.252 --> 00:39:48.504
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

00:39:48.588 --> 00:39:51.674
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

00:39:51.758 --> 00:39:53.927
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.638
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:56.721 --> 00:39:58.181
No, not really. But listen.

00:39:58.264 --> 00:40:01.893
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

00:40:01.976 --> 00:40:04.479
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

00:40:04.562 --> 00:40:08.399
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:11.653
- [locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:40:11.694 --> 00:40:15.573
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

00:40:15.657 --> 00:40:18.826
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

00:40:18.868 --> 00:40:20.995
I'm becoming one of them!

00:40:21.037 --> 00:40:22.789
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]

00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:24.999
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:26.834
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

00:40:26.876 --> 00:40:29.754
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

00:40:29.837 --> 00:40:32.549
- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.

00:40:32.632 --> 00:40:36.511
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

00:40:36.594 --> 00:40:40.056
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:43.309
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

00:40:43.393 --> 00:40:47.146
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.690
[Electronic music]

00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:50.525
[Laughing]

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:52.360
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:40:57.448 --> 00:40:58.449
Ha-ha!

00:41:02.287 --> 00:41:03.288
Yeah!

00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:06.666
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

00:41:11.588 --> 00:41:14.841
[Girls chattering and giggling]

00:41:14.924 --> 00:41:17.218
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:19.554
[Gasping] Oh!

00:41:19.596 --> 00:41:20.972
Let me get this straight.

00:41:21.055 --> 00:41:23.975
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

00:41:24.058 --> 00:41:27.770
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

00:41:27.854 --> 00:41:28.938
I got a road to finish.

00:41:30.273 --> 00:41:32.650
[Grunting and rewing]

00:41:40.783 --> 00:41:43.203
- He's done!
- Done?

00:41:43.286 --> 00:41:45.622
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

00:41:47.582 --> 00:41:50.919
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.838
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

00:41:54.464 --> 00:41:58.092
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

00:41:58.676 --> 00:42:00.261
Oh!

00:42:01.638 --> 00:42:04.307
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

00:42:04.557 --> 00:42:08.019
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

00:42:08.144 --> 00:42:11.606
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]

00:42:11.981 --> 00:42:13.983
Red.

00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:17.946
Who do you think you are?

00:42:17.987 --> 00:42:21.282
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

00:42:21.366 --> 00:42:24.827
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

00:42:24.869 --> 00:42:27.330
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

00:42:27.413 --> 00:42:31.042
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

00:42:31.125 --> 00:42:32.585
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

00:42:32.669 --> 00:42:36.923
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

00:42:37.006 --> 00:42:40.802
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

00:42:40.843 --> 00:42:43.221
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

00:42:43.304 --> 00:42:45.974
If I win, you do the road my way.

00:42:46.057 --> 00:42:47.600
Doc, what're you doin'?

00:42:47.976 --> 00:42:49.811
I don't mean to be rude here,

00:42:49.852 --> 00:42:53.606
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.192
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

00:42:56.276 --> 00:43:00.947
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:05.201
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

00:43:05.285 --> 00:43:09.789
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

00:43:09.873 --> 00:43:12.792
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

00:43:12.876 --> 00:43:15.378
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

00:43:15.461 --> 00:43:20.592
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

00:43:20.675 --> 00:43:22.427
and no lollygaggin'.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.053
Speed. I'm speed.

00:43:24.137 --> 00:43:26.681
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

00:43:26.764 --> 00:43:27.807
[Luigi laughs]

00:43:27.932 --> 00:43:32.729
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

00:43:32.812 --> 00:43:35.315
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

00:43:35.398 --> 00:43:38.276
The race is only one lap, guys.

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:40.820
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

00:43:40.904 --> 00:43:44.741
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

00:43:46.075 --> 00:43:49.913
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:51.998
Gentlemen...

00:43:52.665 --> 00:43:55.501
...start your engines!

00:43:57.629 --> 00:43:59.297
[Engine sputters]

00:43:59.756 --> 00:44:02.217
[Rewing furiously]

00:44:02.258 --> 00:44:04.636
- !Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

00:44:04.719 --> 00:44:07.805
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:09.474
Luigi?

00:44:09.557 --> 00:44:12.727
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.063
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

00:44:15.104 --> 00:44:20.818
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

00:44:22.153 --> 00:44:23.238
[Giggling]

00:44:24.864 --> 00:44:26.741
[Cheering]

00:44:29.285 --> 00:44:30.620
Huh?

00:44:31.287 --> 00:44:33.790
Doc... the flag means go.

00:44:33.873 --> 00:44:37.210
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

00:44:37.293 --> 00:44:40.004
Doc, what are you doing, man?

00:44:40.088 --> 00:44:43.633
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

00:44:43.716 --> 00:44:46.844
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

00:44:46.928 --> 00:44:49.681
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:52.809
You got your tow cable?

00:44:52.892 --> 00:44:55.103
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

00:44:55.144 --> 00:44:57.438
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

00:45:05.989 --> 00:45:08.199
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:45:08.283 --> 00:45:09.993
No, no, no, no, no!

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:12.537
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

00:45:13.288 --> 00:45:15.582
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

00:45:15.665 --> 00:45:17.083
[Rewing]

00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:24.757
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:27.176
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.345
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:32.640
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

00:45:36.436 --> 00:45:38.271
[Gasps] Ah!

00:45:39.022 --> 00:45:41.983
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

00:45:42.025 --> 00:45:45.153
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

00:45:48.281 --> 00:45:50.199
I can make a little turn on dirt.

00:45:50.283 --> 00:45:51.701
You think?

00:45:51.784 --> 00:45:56.247
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

00:45:56.331 --> 00:45:58.791
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

00:45:58.875 --> 00:46:01.836
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

00:46:01.878 --> 00:46:04.255
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

00:46:04.339 --> 00:46:08.801
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

00:46:08.885 --> 00:46:10.470
Nah, not me, Flo.

00:46:10.553 --> 00:46:13.014
I'm on one of them there special diets.

00:46:13.056 --> 00:46:17.685
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

00:46:18.228 --> 00:46:20.521
"You race like you fix roads."

00:46:20.563 --> 00:46:25.360
[Grunting] I'll show him.
[Grunting] I will show him!

00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:38.039
- [Tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

00:46:38.081 --> 00:46:41.709
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

00:46:42.919 --> 00:46:45.505
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

00:46:45.588 --> 00:46:48.299
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

00:46:48.383 --> 00:46:51.386
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.725
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.864
Wow.

00:47:12.198 --> 00:47:13.908
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:19.163
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

00:47:19.247 --> 00:47:21.249
Yes! Uh, amazing!

00:47:21.749 --> 00:47:25.378
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

00:47:25.461 --> 00:47:29.632
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

00:47:29.716 --> 00:47:32.260
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

00:47:32.343 --> 00:47:36.472
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

00:47:36.556 --> 00:47:38.766
[Italian] É bellissima! It's beautiful!

00:47:38.808 --> 00:47:42.562
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:44.772
Boy, I tell you what.

00:47:44.856 --> 00:47:47.692
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

00:47:47.775 --> 00:47:49.444
Doc, look at this!

00:47:49.569 --> 00:47:52.447
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

00:47:52.488 --> 00:47:55.992
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

00:47:56.075 --> 00:47:59.037
Guido, look at Luigi!

00:47:59.662 --> 00:48:01.372
This is fantastico!

00:48:01.456 --> 00:48:04.918
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

00:48:05.001 --> 00:48:09.297
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

00:48:09.964 --> 00:48:12.634
That crazy old devil woman.

00:48:13.134 --> 00:48:16.512
[Sighs] Oh!

00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.431
She's right!

00:48:18.514 --> 00:48:20.058
- Ah!
- Guido!

00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:23.895
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

00:48:25.188 --> 00:48:28.983
Well, now... where the heck is he?

00:48:35.323 --> 00:48:38.034
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

00:48:38.117 --> 00:48:41.496
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

00:48:41.538 --> 00:48:43.915
and asked me if he could
come down here.

00:48:43.998 --> 00:48:46.376
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

00:48:46.459 --> 00:48:49.295
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

00:48:49.754 --> 00:48:52.298
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

00:48:54.509 --> 00:48:58.471
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

00:48:58.555 --> 00:48:59.931
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:49:00.014 --> 00:49:03.893
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

00:49:05.562 --> 00:49:08.356
[Engine rewing]

00:49:11.734 --> 00:49:13.736
[Screaming]

00:49:15.363 --> 00:49:17.532
[Spitting]

00:49:18.283 --> 00:49:20.743
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:23.538
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

00:49:23.621 --> 00:49:26.958
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:30.503
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

00:49:30.587 --> 00:49:33.673
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

00:49:33.756 --> 00:49:36.843
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

00:49:36.926 --> 00:49:38.553
I'll put it simple.

00:49:38.636 --> 00:49:42.807
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

00:49:43.892 --> 00:49:49.272
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

00:49:49.355 --> 00:49:51.149
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

00:49:51.232 --> 00:49:54.819
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

00:49:57.614 --> 00:50:01.034
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

00:50:02.285 --> 00:50:04.078
[Groans]

00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:10.585
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

00:50:11.878 --> 00:50:13.880
Hmm...

00:50:13.963 --> 00:50:15.006
Whoa!

00:50:16.382 --> 00:50:18.801
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]

00:50:19.302 --> 00:50:23.223
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

00:50:24.807 --> 00:50:28.186
[Screaming] Ow!

00:50:29.646 --> 00:50:32.899
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

00:50:32.982 --> 00:50:36.069
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

00:50:36.152 --> 00:50:39.530
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

00:50:39.614 --> 00:50:43.535
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

00:50:50.416 --> 00:50:53.962
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

00:50:54.045 --> 00:50:58.424
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

00:50:59.425 --> 00:51:00.927
[Grunts, passes gas]

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:03.012
Oh, Lord.

00:51:03.096 --> 00:51:04.722
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

00:51:04.806 --> 00:51:06.975
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

00:51:07.016 --> 00:51:10.311
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

00:51:10.395 --> 00:51:13.231
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

00:51:13.314 --> 00:51:15.775
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

00:51:16.859 --> 00:51:18.528
[Groaning] Oh...

00:51:18.611 --> 00:51:21.281
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

00:51:21.364 --> 00:51:23.908
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

00:51:23.992 --> 00:51:27.245
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

00:51:27.328 --> 00:51:29.622
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

00:51:29.706 --> 00:51:31.708
You make-a such a nice new road.

00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:34.460
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

00:51:34.544 --> 00:51:36.129
Even though you not a Ferrari.

00:51:36.212 --> 00:51:40.300
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

00:51:40.383 --> 00:51:44.220
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

00:51:44.304 --> 00:51:47.807
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?

00:51:47.891 --> 00:51:51.477
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:54.981
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

00:51:55.064 --> 00:51:56.733
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

00:51:56.816 --> 00:51:58.943
Ramone, Ramone!

00:51:59.027 --> 00:52:01.112
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

00:52:01.195 --> 00:52:04.157
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.869
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

00:52:07.952 --> 00:52:12.665
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

00:52:12.749 --> 00:52:15.585
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

00:52:15.668 --> 00:52:16.920
[Exhales deeply]

00:52:17.003 --> 00:52:18.171
Ah!

00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:20.381
Stop! Let me...

00:52:21.758 --> 00:52:24.594
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

00:52:24.677 --> 00:52:26.679
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

00:52:26.763 --> 00:52:30.099
Stop, stop! That's cold!

00:52:30.183 --> 00:52:32.685
Help! Please! Stop!

00:52:32.769 --> 00:52:36.105
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

00:52:37.357 --> 00:52:38.608
What was that for?

00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:40.818
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

00:52:40.902 --> 00:52:42.362
If you do, you gotta be clean.

00:52:42.445 --> 00:52:44.989
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

00:52:45.073 --> 00:52:46.783
What, I? I don't get it.

00:52:46.866 --> 00:52:49.452
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:52.747
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:57.460
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

00:52:57.544 --> 00:53:01.422
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

00:53:01.464 --> 00:53:03.883
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

00:53:03.967 --> 00:53:07.220
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

00:53:07.303 --> 00:53:10.473
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

00:53:10.557 --> 00:53:14.018
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

00:53:14.102 --> 00:53:18.231
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

00:53:18.314 --> 00:53:21.651
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

00:53:23.152 --> 00:53:25.405
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

00:53:26.364 --> 00:53:28.825
Cone number one, if you want.

00:53:29.951 --> 00:53:32.287
Oh...

00:53:33.454 --> 00:53:37.166
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:40.336
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.589
[Both chuckle]

00:53:42.922 --> 00:53:46.259
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

00:53:46.342 --> 00:53:48.970
Gonna... Yeah.

00:53:53.683 --> 00:53:56.311
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]

00:53:56.352 --> 00:53:57.854
Good-lookin' girl.

00:53:57.937 --> 00:54:01.232
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

00:54:01.316 --> 00:54:04.777
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

00:54:05.904 --> 00:54:08.364
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

00:54:08.448 --> 00:54:12.577
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.831
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

00:54:16.873 --> 00:54:20.460
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

00:54:20.543 --> 00:54:22.837
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

00:54:22.879 --> 00:54:24.672
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

00:54:24.714 --> 00:54:27.717
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.136
I can handle anything.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:35.016
- [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

00:54:35.308 --> 00:54:38.811
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

00:54:38.895 --> 00:54:41.356
- [Tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

00:54:41.397 --> 00:54:45.401
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

00:54:45.485 --> 00:54:47.320
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:50.281
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

00:54:50.365 --> 00:54:51.783
Wait, Mater!

00:54:53.576 --> 00:54:54.911
OK, here's what you do.

00:54:54.994 --> 00:54:58.373
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

00:54:58.456 --> 00:55:00.959
And they do the rest. Watch this.

00:55:08.007 --> 00:55:09.842
- [Honking loudly]
- Oh!

00:55:09.884 --> 00:55:15.098
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:18.977
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.938
[Laughing loudly]

00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:25.149
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

00:55:25.233 --> 00:55:29.028
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

00:55:29.112 --> 00:55:31.698
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

00:55:34.659 --> 00:55:37.245
- [Honking]
- Oh!

00:55:37.328 --> 00:55:40.915
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

00:55:40.999 --> 00:55:43.918
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.964
[Laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

00:55:48.047 --> 00:55:49.799
Oh, your turn, bud.

00:55:49.883 --> 00:55:52.260
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

00:55:52.343 --> 00:55:54.596
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

00:55:54.637 --> 00:55:55.638
[Clucking]

00:55:55.722 --> 00:55:59.100
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

00:56:06.149 --> 00:56:09.110
[Snoring]

00:56:16.159 --> 00:56:19.495
- [Rewing engine]
- Oh!

00:56:19.871 --> 00:56:23.958
[All exclaiming and mooing]

00:56:30.548 --> 00:56:33.843
[All gurgling]

00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:38.973
[All backfiring]

00:56:44.103 --> 00:56:46.856
[Angry mooing]

00:56:47.982 --> 00:56:49.692
[Mooing]

00:56:50.026 --> 00:56:51.402
That's Frank.

00:56:53.988 --> 00:56:56.491
- [Bellowing angrily]
- [Shouting]

00:56:57.784 --> 00:57:01.287
- [Mooing]
- [Engine rewing]

00:57:06.543 --> 00:57:10.880
[Mater laughing]

00:57:10.964 --> 00:57:13.675
Run!

00:57:13.716 --> 00:57:15.718
- Here he comes, look out!
- [Bellowing]

00:57:16.719 --> 00:57:18.346
[Laughing] Whoa!

00:57:19.556 --> 00:57:20.932
[Screaming]

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:24.352
Run! He's gonna get ya!

00:57:31.234 --> 00:57:33.695
[Mater laughing]

00:57:43.705 --> 00:57:44.789
Oh! Customers!

00:57:45.748 --> 00:57:47.500
Oh!

00:57:49.294 --> 00:57:50.879
Ah, no, no, no.

00:57:50.962 --> 00:57:52.714
Oof! Oh!

00:57:54.257 --> 00:57:57.135
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

00:57:57.218 --> 00:58:00.722
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

00:58:00.972 --> 00:58:05.059
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

00:58:05.143 --> 00:58:07.103
Oh, yeah... yeah.

00:58:07.145 --> 00:58:10.231
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

00:58:10.315 --> 00:58:13.526
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.569
Oh...

00:58:14.652 --> 00:58:19.949
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:24.287
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

00:58:24.329 --> 00:58:28.249
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

00:58:28.291 --> 00:58:31.044
- Where, where?
- [Laughing]

00:58:31.127 --> 00:58:33.713
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

00:58:33.796 --> 00:58:35.924
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

00:58:36.007 --> 00:58:37.217
- Way.
- Come on, look...

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.719
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

00:58:39.802 --> 00:58:41.429
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:43.348
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

00:58:43.431 --> 00:58:45.433
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

00:58:45.516 --> 00:58:47.060
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

00:58:47.143 --> 00:58:49.103
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

00:58:49.187 --> 00:58:52.482
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

00:58:52.565 --> 00:58:57.487
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

00:58:57.528 --> 00:59:00.657
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:03.409
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:04.869
Mater? Mater!

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:08.540
- Mater!
- [Laughing]

00:59:19.676 --> 00:59:21.135
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

00:59:21.177 --> 00:59:23.555
[Screaming happily]

00:59:26.558 --> 00:59:27.892
Oof!

00:59:27.976 --> 00:59:31.354
[Blubbering] Yee-hee!

00:59:31.854 --> 00:59:33.690
[Chuckling] He's nuts.

00:59:35.525 --> 00:59:37.235
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:41.781
Just need to know where I've been.

00:59:41.864 --> 00:59:44.993
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

00:59:45.034 --> 00:59:49.038
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

00:59:49.122 --> 00:59:52.375
[Chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

00:59:52.417 --> 00:59:55.962
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

00:59:57.463 --> 01:00:01.175
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

01:00:01.259 --> 01:00:03.595
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:06.681
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

01:00:06.764 --> 01:00:10.351
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

01:00:10.393 --> 01:00:12.061
with private helicopters.

01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:15.398
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:17.609
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

01:00:19.402 --> 01:00:23.031
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

01:00:23.114 --> 01:00:26.284
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

01:00:26.618 --> 01:00:31.331
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

01:00:31.414 --> 01:00:36.002
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

01:00:36.085 --> 01:00:38.880
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

01:00:38.922 --> 01:00:40.715
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

01:00:40.924 --> 01:00:44.761
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

01:00:44.802 --> 01:00:46.638
In what?

01:00:47.555 --> 01:00:49.474
My best friend.

01:00:55.939 --> 01:00:57.649
See you tomorrow, buddy!

01:00:57.732 --> 01:01:01.194
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,

01:01:01.277 --> 01:01:04.906
K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!

01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:07.700
[Laughing]

01:01:07.784 --> 01:01:10.370
[Rewing engine] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:10.453 --> 01:01:11.829
[Chuckling]

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:17.627
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!

01:01:18.628 --> 01:01:21.130
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

01:01:21.214 --> 01:01:22.632
[Both scream]

01:01:22.715 --> 01:01:25.343
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

01:01:25.426 --> 01:01:27.554
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

01:01:27.637 --> 01:01:30.723
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

01:01:30.807 --> 01:01:33.518
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

01:01:33.601 --> 01:01:36.312
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

01:01:36.396 --> 01:01:38.398
Something about a helicopter ride.

01:01:38.856 --> 01:01:41.651
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

01:01:41.693 --> 01:01:43.611
- Did you mean it?
- What?

01:01:43.653 --> 01:01:45.697
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.783
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

01:01:48.866 --> 01:01:50.869
Uh-huh.

01:01:50.952 --> 01:01:54.122
You know... Mater trusts you.

01:01:55.498 --> 01:01:57.876
Yeah, OK.

01:01:57.959 --> 01:02:00.628
- Did you mean that?
- What?

01:02:00.712 --> 01:02:06.342
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

01:02:06.426 --> 01:02:09.095
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

01:02:09.846 --> 01:02:12.682
Yeah, OK. G'night.

01:02:15.101 --> 01:02:16.269
[Groans] Oh...

01:02:16.352 --> 01:02:18.521
Hey, thank you.

01:02:20.857 --> 01:02:22.483
What did you just say?

01:02:23.192 --> 01:02:25.403
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

01:02:25.486 --> 01:02:29.365
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

01:02:29.407 --> 01:02:32.994
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.414
- G'night.
- Good night.

01:02:40.627 --> 01:02:42.128
Hmm.

01:29:59.015 --> 01:30:02.227
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:05.521
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

01:30:05.605 --> 01:30:08.316
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

01:30:08.399 --> 01:30:10.652
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

01:30:13.029 --> 01:30:16.032
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:30:16.115 --> 01:30:18.201
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

01:30:18.284 --> 01:30:21.496
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

01:30:21.579 --> 01:30:23.665
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

01:30:29.504 --> 01:30:32.298
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.717
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

01:30:34.801 --> 01:30:37.512
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

01:30:37.554 --> 01:30:39.847
You don't belong there, anyway.

01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:42.934
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

01:30:43.393 --> 01:30:45.687
[Engine starts]

01:30:45.728 --> 01:30:47.981
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

01:30:55.113 --> 01:30:57.490
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

01:30:57.532 --> 01:30:59.951
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

01:31:08.418 --> 01:31:12.171
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

01:31:12.797 --> 01:31:15.925
Best for everyone or best for you?

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.236
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

01:32:20.823 --> 01:32:23.117
[Light buzzing]

01:32:34.796 --> 01:32:38.132
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

01:32:38.174 --> 01:32:40.468
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

01:32:40.552 --> 01:32:42.804
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

01:32:42.845 --> 01:32:45.306
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:47.934
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

01:32:48.017 --> 01:32:52.355
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

01:32:52.438 --> 01:32:54.983
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

01:32:55.066 --> 01:32:58.403
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

01:32:58.486 --> 01:33:01.698
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

01:33:01.781 --> 01:33:05.785
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

01:33:05.827 --> 01:33:08.162
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

01:33:08.246 --> 01:33:12.333
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

01:33:12.417 --> 01:33:15.044
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

01:33:15.128 --> 01:33:19.215
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

01:33:19.299 --> 01:33:22.385
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

01:33:22.468 --> 01:33:23.469
[Mia] He's hot!

01:33:23.511 --> 01:33:26.180
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

01:33:26.264 --> 01:33:29.350
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

01:33:29.434 --> 01:33:31.978
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.981
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

01:33:35.023 --> 01:33:37.817
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

01:33:37.859 --> 01:33:40.987
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:46.034
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

01:33:46.117 --> 01:33:50.038
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

01:33:50.079 --> 01:33:51.372
[Guard] Sorry, pal.

01:33:51.414 --> 01:33:55.710
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

01:33:56.461 --> 01:33:59.255
I am speed.

01:33:59.339 --> 01:34:00.924
[Cars whizzing]

01:34:01.007 --> 01:34:02.217
Victory.

01:34:02.258 --> 01:34:04.385
One winner, two losers.

01:34:04.469 --> 01:34:06.429
[Engine rewing]

01:34:06.512 --> 01:34:12.018
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:14.687
[birds singing]

01:34:16.147 --> 01:34:17.148
[Knock on door]

01:34:17.232 --> 01:34:18.816
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.569
[Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

01:34:24.864 --> 01:34:27.867
[Indistinct chatter]

01:34:34.916 --> 01:34:37.752
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

01:34:37.835 --> 01:34:40.421
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

01:34:40.505 --> 01:34:42.924
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

01:34:42.966 --> 01:34:45.343
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

01:34:50.723 --> 01:34:52.725
[All shouting]

01:34:52.767 --> 01:34:54.519
[Gulping]

01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:04.028
Uh-oh

01:35:08.032 --> 01:35:10.660
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]

01:35:14.914 --> 01:35:17.876
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

01:35:18.042 --> 01:35:20.295
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

01:35:20.336 --> 01:35:23.464
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

01:35:23.548 --> 01:35:25.967
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

01:35:26.009 --> 01:35:29.095
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

01:35:30.221 --> 01:35:33.349
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

01:35:33.433 --> 01:35:34.601
[Chuckling]

01:35:34.642 --> 01:35:36.978
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

01:35:37.061 --> 01:35:39.981
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

01:35:40.023 --> 01:35:43.026
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:46.279
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

01:35:53.119 --> 01:35:55.163
Agh! Shoot!

01:35:55.246 --> 01:35:58.374
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

01:36:02.003 --> 01:36:04.547
[Crowd cheering]

01:36:04.672 --> 01:36:06.216
Come on, you can do it!

01:36:06.299 --> 01:36:08.301
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

01:36:09.552 --> 01:36:12.722
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

01:36:12.805 --> 01:36:16.017
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

01:36:18.186 --> 01:36:20.355
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

01:36:20.438 --> 01:36:22.857
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

01:36:22.899 --> 01:36:24.651
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

01:36:24.692 --> 01:36:27.028
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

01:36:30.907 --> 01:36:33.910
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]

01:36:35.245 --> 01:36:36.329
[Breaks squealing]

01:36:36.412 --> 01:36:38.498
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

01:36:38.581 --> 01:36:39.582
[All gasp]

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:45.046
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

01:36:45.129 --> 01:36:48.675
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]

01:36:48.716 --> 01:36:49.759
[Groans]

01:36:49.842 --> 01:36:53.888
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

01:36:53.972 --> 01:36:55.390
I don't think I...

01:36:55.473 --> 01:36:58.226
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

01:36:58.434 --> 01:36:59.978
Doc?

01:37:02.647 --> 01:37:05.275
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

01:37:05.358 --> 01:37:09.112
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

01:37:09.195 --> 01:37:11.072
You said you'd never come back.

01:37:11.155 --> 01:37:14.742
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

01:37:14.826 --> 01:37:17.745
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

01:37:17.787 --> 01:37:19.664
[Chuckles]

01:37:21.708 --> 01:37:25.211
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

01:37:25.253 --> 01:37:28.548
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:30.592
Now, get back out there!

01:37:32.844 --> 01:37:35.805
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

01:37:35.889 --> 01:37:38.182
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

01:37:38.266 --> 01:37:41.436
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

01:37:41.477 --> 01:37:43.187
Kid, you can beat these guys.

01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:46.649
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

01:37:55.909 --> 01:37:58.286
[Murmuring]

01:37:58.369 --> 01:38:00.288
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

01:38:00.330 --> 01:38:04.125
Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

01:38:04.167 --> 01:38:06.794
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

01:38:06.878 --> 01:38:09.297
And look who he has for a crew chief!

01:38:09.339 --> 01:38:12.050
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

01:38:12.133 --> 01:38:15.470
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

01:38:17.931 --> 01:38:20.016
[Crowd cheering]

01:38:20.099 --> 01:38:22.101
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

01:38:22.185 --> 01:38:25.104
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

01:38:25.146 --> 01:38:26.564
Hey, Doc!

01:38:26.648 --> 01:38:30.818
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

01:38:35.698 --> 01:38:39.494
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

01:38:39.577 --> 01:38:42.497
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

01:38:42.539 --> 01:38:45.458
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.126
Vai! Vai, vai!

01:38:47.168 --> 01:38:50.088
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

01:38:50.171 --> 01:38:53.591
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

01:38:53.675 --> 01:38:54.676
[All laugh]

01:38:54.759 --> 01:38:57.345
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

01:38:57.428 --> 01:39:00.598
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

01:39:15.029 --> 01:39:17.865
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

01:39:19.409 --> 01:39:20.702
What do you think of this?

01:39:20.743 --> 01:39:22.912
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

01:39:26.207 --> 01:39:27.542
What?

01:39:27.584 --> 01:39:29.377
Whoa! Git-R-done!

01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:35.425
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

01:39:35.508 --> 01:39:38.469
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

01:39:38.553 --> 01:39:40.388
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:43.600
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

01:39:47.228 --> 01:39:50.440
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

01:39:56.154 --> 01:39:58.448
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

01:39:59.407 --> 01:40:00.950
No, you don't.

01:40:02.076 --> 01:40:03.953
[Tire blows]

01:40:04.037 --> 01:40:06.039
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.542
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

01:40:09.584 --> 01:40:12.921
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

01:40:14.839 --> 01:40:16.966
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:19.969
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

01:40:20.053 --> 01:40:22.222
Guido! It's time.

01:40:26.476 --> 01:40:29.562
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

01:40:32.190 --> 01:40:34.692
[Air wrench whirring]

01:40:38.696 --> 01:40:40.114
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

01:40:40.198 --> 01:40:41.908
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:44.536
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

01:40:44.619 --> 01:40:46.287
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

01:40:47.956 --> 01:40:50.458
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.876
[Darrell] He's back in!

01:40:53.211 --> 01:40:54.212
Peet stop.

01:40:55.630 --> 01:40:57.590
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

01:41:12.855 --> 01:41:15.942
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

01:41:15.984 --> 01:41:18.361
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

01:41:18.444 --> 01:41:21.948
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

01:41:22.031 --> 01:41:23.324
This is it, kiddo.

01:41:23.366 --> 01:41:25.869
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

01:41:25.952 --> 01:41:28.371
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

01:41:28.454 --> 01:41:29.831
- Go!
- [Rewing]

01:41:32.542 --> 01:41:33.668
We'll see about that!

01:41:35.169 --> 01:41:36.754
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!
