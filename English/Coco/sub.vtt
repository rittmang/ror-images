WEBVTT

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.009
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.644
Because of something that
happened before I was even born.

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:18.997
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:23.020
The papa, he was a musician.

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:26.872
He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings.

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:31.662
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.035
And one day,

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:41.038
he left with his guitar
and never returned.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:51.050
And the mama...

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:53.718
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.160
After banishing all music from
her life she found a way...

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.776
to provide for her daughter.

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.068
She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:17.509
She could have made candy,

00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.612
or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:25.933
for wrestlers,
but no, she chose shoes.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.804
Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.777
And later,
she taught her son-in-law.

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:37.765
Then her grandkids got roped in.

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:42.418
As her family grew,
so did the business.

00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:46.689
Music had torn her family apart.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:49.825
But shoes held
them all together.

00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.147
You see, that woman was

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.697
my great-great-grandmother,
Mama Imelda.

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:59.520
She died way before I was born.

00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:01.689
But my family
still tells her story

00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:04.258
every year
on Dia de los Muertos...

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.760
the Day of the Dead.

00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:07.661
And her little girl,

00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:10.113
she's my great-grandmother,
Mama Coco.

00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:12.701
Hola, Mama Coco.

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:15.237
How are you, Julio?

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.405
Actually, my name is Miguel.

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:21.244
Mama Coco has trouble
remembering things.

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:23.278
But it's good
to talk to her anyway.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.414
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.149
I used to run like this.

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:30.153
But now I run like this
which is way faster.

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:34.323
And the winner
is Luchadora Coco!

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.459
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:38.427
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.662
Miguel, eat your food.

00:03:40.664 --> 00:03:43.299
My abuelita,
she's Mama Coco's daughter.

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.435
Oh, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:47.570
No, gracias.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:50.806
I asked if you would
like more tamales!

00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:52.176
Si?

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:54.746
That's what I thought you said!

00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:56.312
Abuelita runs our house

00:03:56.314 --> 00:03:58.181
just like Mama Imelda did.

00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:02.186
No music!

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.722
No music!

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:06.590
♪ Y aunque la vida ♪

00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:07.892
No music!

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:10.328
I think we're
the only family in Mexico

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.297
who hates music.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.299
And my family's fine
with that. But me...

00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:17.649
- Be back by lunch, mijo.
- Love you, Mama.

00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:21.221
I am not like
the rest of my family!

00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:23.875
- Hola, Miguel!
- Hola!

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:32.066
- Muchas gracias.
- De nada, Miguel.

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:38.640
Hey! Dante!

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:43.811
Sit. Down.
Roll over. Shake.

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:45.598
Fist bump!

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.815
Good boy, Dante!

00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:54.007
I know I'm not
supposed to love music.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.576
But it's not my fault!
It's his!

00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:59.478
Ernesto de la Cruz.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.415
The greatest musician
of all time.

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:04.351
Right here in this very plaza,

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:07.920
Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps...

00:05:07.922 --> 00:05:12.493
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:17.396
He started out a total
nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:21.435
But when he played music, he made
people fall in love with him.

00:05:21.438 --> 00:05:24.537
He starred in movies.

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.841
He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly!

00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:31.411
And he wrote the best songs.

00:05:31.413 --> 00:05:33.648
But my all-time favorite,
it's...

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.683
♪ Remember me

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:36.950
♪ Remember me

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:38.819

to say goodbye

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.689
- ♪ Remember me.
- ♪ Remember me

00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:44.592
♪ Don't let it make you cry

♪ I hold you in my heart

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.300

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:53.303

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:54.970

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:57.307

00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:08.799
He lived the kind
of life you dream about.

00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:14.204
Until 1942.

00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:19.144
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.

00:06:19.898 --> 00:06:22.614
I want to be just like him.

00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:30.773
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz

00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:35.011
and I get this feeling
like we're connected.

00:06:35.013 --> 00:06:39.965
Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.

00:06:40.618 --> 00:06:42.620
If it wasn't for my family.

00:06:42.622 --> 00:06:45.022
- Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
- Huh?

00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:47.458
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.493
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:52.764
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:53.764
If I were you,

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:55.934
I'd march right up
to my family and say...

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:58.536
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it."

00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:00.472
I could never say that.

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.007
You are a musician, no?

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.408
I don't know.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.944
I mean, I only
really play for myself.

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:09.013
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:10.916
by hiding his skills?

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:14.052
No! He walked out
onto that plaza

00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:16.053
and he played out loud.

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:18.524
Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight!

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:20.926
The music competition
for Dia de Muertos.

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:23.662
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

00:07:23.664 --> 00:07:26.566
Uh-uh.
My family would freak!

00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:30.252
Look, if you're too scared then,
well, have fun making shoes.

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.955
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.958
Seize your moment?

00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:39.078
Show me what you got, muchacho.

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:42.397
I'll be your first audience.

00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:51.139
Miguel!

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:54.962
- Abuelita!
- What are you doing here?

00:07:56.466 --> 00:07:57.898
You leave my grandson alone.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.999
Dona, please!

00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:00.167
I was just getting a shine.

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:03.439
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.971
He was just
showing me his guitar.

00:08:04.974 --> 00:08:06.774
Shame on you.

00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:12.080
My grandson is a sweet little
Angelito Querido Cielito.

00:08:12.082 --> 00:08:14.816
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:16.150
You keep away from him.

00:08:19.856 --> 00:08:23.592
Ay, pobrecito.
Oh, estas bien, mijo.

00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:27.829
You know better than to
be here in this place!

00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:31.216
You will come home. Now.

00:08:41.245 --> 00:08:42.877
How many times have we told you?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.246
That plaza is
crawling with mariachis.

00:08:45.248 --> 00:08:47.484
Yes, Tio Berto.

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:50.619
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Ah! Go away, you. Go!

00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:51.887
It's just Dante.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:54.022
Never name a street dog.

00:08:54.024 --> 00:08:57.075
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.

00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:05.936
I found your son
in Mariachi Plaza.

00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:07.003
Ay, Miguel!

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.639
You know how Abuelita
feels about the plaza.

00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:10.941
I was just shining shoes.

00:09:10.943 --> 00:09:12.509
A musician's shoes!

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.647
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.283
If Abuelita says no more
plaza, then no more plaza.

00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:22.687
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:25.522
Well, they're having
this talent show.

00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:27.759
And I thought I might...

00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:30.293
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

00:09:30.295 --> 00:09:33.664
You have to have
talent to be in a talent show.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:36.634
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes?

00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:38.102
It's Dia de los Muertos.

00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:41.539
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:44.358
Ofrenda room. Vamonos.

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:56.956
Don't give me that look.

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.793
Dia de los Muertos
is the one night of the year

00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:01.828
our ancestors can come visit us.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.063
We've put their photos
on the ofrenda

00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:05.965
so their spirits can cross over.

00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:07.933
That is very important.

00:10:07.936 --> 00:10:10.836
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:12.572
We made all this food,

00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:15.208
set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.578
All this work
to bring the family together.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.847
I don't want you sneaking
off to who knows where.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.282
Where are you going?

00:10:23.284 --> 00:10:24.819
I thought we were done.

00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:27.954
Ay, Dios mio. Being part
of this family means

00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:29.824
being here for this family.

00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:32.092
I don't want
to see you end up like...

00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:33.261
Like Mama Coco's papa?

00:10:33.263 --> 00:10:36.730
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

00:10:36.732 --> 00:10:37.831
But you're the one who...

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:38.999
I was just...

00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:40.267
But... I...

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.637
Papa? Papa is home?

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:46.608
Mama, calmese, calmese.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.376
Papa is coming home?

00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:51.495
No, Mama.
It's okay. I'm here.

00:10:52.616 --> 00:10:54.247
Who are you?

00:10:54.249 --> 00:10:57.853
Rest, Mama.

00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:01.023
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:03.207
Miguel? Miguel?

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:09.298
What are we going
to do with that boy?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.351
You're right.
That's just what he needs.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:39.028
It's you. Get in here.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.098
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.068
You're gonna
get me in trouble, boy.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:45.652
Someone could hear me.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.342
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.662
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:00.400
Perfecto!

00:12:33.822 --> 00:12:36.388
I have to sing.
I have to play!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.141
The music, it's not
just in me, it is me.

00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:46.047
When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.

00:12:46.968 --> 00:12:49.168
The rest of the world
may follow the rules,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.053
but I must follow my heart.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.107
Ugh!

00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:56.909
You know that feeling like
there's a song in the air and...

00:12:56.911 --> 00:12:59.028
it's playing just for you?

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.320
♪ A feeling so close...

00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:09.638
♪ You could
reach out and touch it

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.159
♪ I never knew

00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:16.312
♪ I could want something
so much, but it's true ♪

00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:18.866
You must have faith, sister.

00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:21.301
Oh, but, Padre,
he will never listen.

00:13:21.303 --> 00:13:23.338
He will listen. To music.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.941
♪ Only a song,
only a song

00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:29.626
♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪

00:13:33.884 --> 00:13:36.768
Never underestimate
the power of music.

00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:44.493
But my father, he will
never give his permission.

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:46.127
I am done asking permission.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.299
When you see your moment, you
mustn't let it pass you by.

00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:51.200
You must seize it!

00:13:51.202 --> 00:13:52.434
Senor de la Cruz,

00:13:52.436 --> 00:13:55.485
what did it take for you
to seize your moment?

00:13:57.042 --> 00:13:59.943
I had to have faith in my dream.

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:01.911
No one was going
to hand it to me.

00:14:01.913 --> 00:14:04.213
It was up to me
to reach for that dream.

00:14:04.215 --> 00:14:06.183
Grab it tight
and make it come true.

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:07.801
...and make it come true.

00:14:12.325 --> 00:14:15.959
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.131
I'm gonna play in Mariachi
Plaza if it kills me.

00:14:23.503 --> 00:14:27.205
Dia de los Muertos has begun!

00:14:27.207 --> 00:14:30.474
No, no. We have to make
a clear path.

00:14:30.476 --> 00:14:33.109
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:35.147
We don't want
their spirits to get lost.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:37.849
We want them to come
and enjoy all the food

00:14:37.852 --> 00:14:39.467
and drinks on the ofrenda.

00:14:40.553 --> 00:14:41.918
Mama!

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.287
Where should we put this table?

00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:44.989
In the courtyard, mijos.

00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:46.158
You want it down by the kitchen?

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.559
Si. Next to the other one.

00:14:51.131 --> 00:14:54.100
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:57.536
Nothing! Mama, Papa. I...

00:14:57.539 --> 00:15:02.408
Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.645
We've all decided. It's time
you joined us in the workshop!

00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:09.116
- What?
- No more shining shoes.

00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:12.051
You'll be making them
every day after school.

00:15:12.053 --> 00:15:15.120
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.589
carrying on
the family tradition.

00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:20.260
And on Dia de los Muertos!

00:15:20.262 --> 00:15:23.062
Your ancestors will be so proud.

00:15:23.064 --> 00:15:26.466
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tia Victoria.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:29.136
And wingtips
like your Papa Julio.

00:15:29.138 --> 00:15:31.671
But what if
I'm no good at making shoes?

00:15:31.673 --> 00:15:36.044
Ah, Miguel. You have your
family here to guide you.

00:15:36.046 --> 00:15:40.631
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...

00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:44.184
A shoemaker.
Through and through.

00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:47.222
That's my boy!
Berto!

00:15:47.224 --> 00:15:50.189
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:03.821
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:17.402
No, no, no, no, no! No.

00:16:29.232 --> 00:16:31.534
De la Cruz's guitar?

00:16:31.536 --> 00:16:34.985
Papa? Papa?

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:40.111
Mama Coco, is your papa
Ernesto de la Cruz?

00:16:40.113 --> 00:16:42.745
Papa! Papa!

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.495
Papa! Papa! It's him!

00:16:56.497 --> 00:16:58.362
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

00:16:58.364 --> 00:17:00.398
Miguel, get down from there.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.166
Mama Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

00:17:03.169 --> 00:17:04.468
What are you talking about?

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.552
I'm gonna be a musician!

00:17:08.273 --> 00:17:09.575
What is all this?

00:17:09.577 --> 00:17:11.675
You keep secrets
from your own family?

00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:14.012
It's all that time
he spends in the plaza.

00:17:14.014 --> 00:17:15.414
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

00:17:15.416 --> 00:17:17.016
It's not a fantasy.

00:17:17.018 --> 00:17:19.282
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!

00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:21.153
The greatest musician
of all time!

00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:22.687
We've never known anything
about this man!

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:26.425
But whoever he was, he still
abandoned his family.

00:17:26.427 --> 00:17:28.059
This is no future for my son.

00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:30.596
But, Papa, you said
my family would guide me.

00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:33.166
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:34.701
I'm supposed to play music.

00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:37.036
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.038
I will not allow it.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.571
- If you would just let...
- Miguel...

00:17:40.573 --> 00:17:42.176
You will listen to your family.

00:17:42.178 --> 00:17:43.475
No more music.

00:17:43.477 --> 00:17:46.627
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

00:17:48.449 --> 00:17:51.117
You want to end up
like that man? Forgotten?

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:53.520
Left off your family's ofrenda?

00:17:53.523 --> 00:17:55.655
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid ofrenda.

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.659
- No!
- Mama!

00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:09.203
There. No guitar.
No music.

00:18:11.475 --> 00:18:16.409
Oh, come. You'll feel better
after you eat with your family.

00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:18.528
I don't want
to be in this family!

00:18:18.748 --> 00:18:20.996
Miguel! Miguel!

00:18:39.436 --> 00:18:42.303
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.

00:18:42.305 --> 00:18:43.505
Can I still sign up?

00:18:43.507 --> 00:18:45.174
You got an instrument?

00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:47.509
No. But if I
can borrow a guitar...

00:18:47.511 --> 00:18:49.378
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.847
You find a guitar, kid,

00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:52.564
I'll put you on the list.

00:18:54.787 --> 00:18:58.253
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, muchacho.

00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:01.256
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

00:19:01.258 --> 00:19:03.392
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

00:19:03.394 --> 00:19:05.976
Get out of here, kid.

00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:22.160
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

00:19:59.854 --> 00:20:01.353
No, no, no, no.

00:20:01.355 --> 00:20:04.223
Dante, stop! Callate! Shh!

00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:27.195
I'm sorry.

00:21:03.454 --> 00:21:07.289
Senor de la Cruz,
please don't be mad.

00:21:07.291 --> 00:21:08.656
I'm Miguel.

00:21:08.658 --> 00:21:13.242
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

00:21:16.267 --> 00:21:18.800
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

00:21:18.803 --> 00:21:22.703
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

00:21:22.705 --> 00:21:25.474
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

00:21:25.476 --> 00:21:26.990
To seize my moment!

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.281
So, if it's all right with you,

00:21:31.283 --> 00:21:33.999
I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!

00:21:41.727 --> 00:21:44.694
The guitar! It's gone!

00:21:44.696 --> 00:21:46.995
Somebody stole
de la Cruz's guitar!

00:21:46.997 --> 00:21:49.300
The window's broken.
Look!

00:21:53.706 --> 00:21:55.472
All right, who's in there?

00:21:55.474 --> 00:21:57.308
I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.824
De la Cruz is my...

00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:02.194
There's nobody here.

00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:18.996
- Miguel!
- Mama!

00:22:18.998 --> 00:22:23.635
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

00:22:26.873 --> 00:22:30.475
Dios mio!
Little boy. Are you okay?

00:22:30.477 --> 00:22:32.192
Here. Let me help you.

00:22:33.081 --> 00:22:34.861
Thanks. I...

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:47.374
Do you mind? Whoa!

00:23:07.915 --> 00:23:10.651
Look how big she's getting.

00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:15.689
Dante!

00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:18.691
You can see me? Wait!

00:23:18.693 --> 00:23:21.745
What's going on? Dante!

00:23:23.634 --> 00:23:25.932
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Miguel?

00:23:25.934 --> 00:23:27.717
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

00:23:31.106 --> 00:23:34.808
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.445
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

00:23:37.447 --> 00:23:38.947
Remind me how I know you.

00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:41.931
We're your family, mijo.

00:23:42.886 --> 00:23:45.736
- Tia Rosita?
- Si.

00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:49.907
- Papa Julio?
- Hola.

00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:52.094
Tia Victoria?

00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:54.595
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

00:23:54.597 --> 00:23:57.500
He's not quite alive either.

00:23:57.502 --> 00:24:00.102
We need Mama Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

00:24:00.104 --> 00:24:04.106
Oye! It's Mama Imelda.

00:24:04.108 --> 00:24:05.508
She couldn't cross over.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.943
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

00:24:07.945 --> 00:24:10.746
Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe?

00:24:10.748 --> 00:24:12.847
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:15.484
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

00:24:15.486 --> 00:24:17.619
But if Mama Imelda
can't come to us...

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:19.888
Then we are going to her.
Vamonos!

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.172
Whoa.

00:24:35.174 --> 00:24:37.923
Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.

00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:55.107
Dante? Dante!
Dante, wait up!

00:24:57.531 --> 00:25:02.382
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.225
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

00:25:26.227 --> 00:25:28.194
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

00:25:28.196 --> 00:25:30.062
I thought it might've been
one of those

00:25:30.064 --> 00:25:31.997
made up things
that adults tell kids.

00:25:31.999 --> 00:25:33.567
Like vitamins.

00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:35.702
Miguel,
vitamins are a real thing.

00:25:35.704 --> 00:25:37.870
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:39.938
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

00:25:39.941 --> 00:25:41.608
Ay! Santa Maria!

00:25:49.285 --> 00:25:53.688
Are those...
Alebrijes! But those are...

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.223
Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.

00:25:56.225 --> 00:25:58.091
They guide souls
on their journey.

00:25:58.093 --> 00:26:00.562
Watch your step. They
make caquitas everywhere.

00:26:00.564 --> 00:26:02.764
Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.

00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:05.600
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.

00:26:05.602 --> 00:26:07.834
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?

00:26:07.836 --> 00:26:09.303
Some churros.
From my family.

00:26:09.305 --> 00:26:11.305
How wonderful. Next.

00:26:11.307 --> 00:26:13.175
If you are
experiencing travel issues,

00:26:13.177 --> 00:26:14.909
agents at
the Department of Family...

00:26:14.912 --> 00:26:17.145
Reunions are
available to assist you.

00:26:17.147 --> 00:26:18.930
Next family, please.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.987
Oh! Your photos
are on your son's ofrenda.

00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:26.353
Have a great visit.

00:26:26.356 --> 00:26:27.622
Gracias.

00:26:27.624 --> 00:26:29.659
And remember
to return before sunrise.

00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:30.860
Enjoy your visit.

00:26:30.862 --> 00:26:33.195
Next.

00:26:33.197 --> 00:26:36.732
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.
Enjoy your visit.

00:26:36.734 --> 00:26:38.516
- Gracias.
- Next?

00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:43.038
Yes! It is I.
Frida Kahlo.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.607
Shall we skip the scanner?

00:26:44.609 --> 00:26:48.326
I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingy.

00:26:50.047 --> 00:26:54.618
Well, shoot, looks like no one
put up your photo, Frida.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.889
Okay, when I said I was Frida,
just now, that was a lie.

00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:00.289
And I apologize for doing that.

00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:03.160
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:06.945
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.081
Hey!

00:27:15.642 --> 00:27:19.376
Almost... there.
Just a little further.

00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:25.249
Upsy-daisy...

00:27:25.251 --> 00:27:29.654
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

00:27:29.656 --> 00:27:33.759
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:36.060
- Next?
- Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.

00:27:36.062 --> 00:27:38.998
Welcome back, amigos.
Anything to declare?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.417
As a matter of fact, yes.

00:27:42.802 --> 00:27:44.117
Hola.

00:27:50.944 --> 00:27:53.112
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.

00:27:53.114 --> 00:27:55.997
Please report to Level Seven.

00:28:00.288 --> 00:28:02.036
Whoa!

00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:07.275
I miss my nose.

00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:18.271
Come on, help us out, amigo.

00:28:18.273 --> 00:28:19.740
We got to get to
a dozen ofrendas tonight.

00:28:19.742 --> 00:28:23.877
We are not visiting your ex-wife's
family for Dia de Muertos!

00:28:23.879 --> 00:28:26.414
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

00:28:26.416 --> 00:28:29.316
I'm sorry, senora, it says
here no one put up your photo.

00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:33.887
My family always puts my
photo on the ofrenda.

00:28:33.889 --> 00:28:36.990
That devil box tells
you nothing but lies!

00:28:36.992 --> 00:28:41.762
- Mama Imelda?
- Oh, mi familia!

00:28:41.764 --> 00:28:43.364
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

00:28:43.366 --> 00:28:45.867
Tell this woman
and her devil box

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:48.403
that my photo is on the ofrenda.

00:28:48.405 --> 00:28:51.874
Well, we never
made it to the ofrenda.

00:28:51.876 --> 00:28:55.592
- What?
- We ran into...

00:28:58.282 --> 00:29:01.399
- Miguel?
- Mama Imelda.

00:29:01.819 --> 00:29:04.153
What is going on?

00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:06.455
You the Rivera family?

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.425
Well, you're cursed.

00:29:09.428 --> 00:29:10.560
What?

00:29:10.562 --> 00:29:13.196
Dia de los Muertos is the
night to give to the dead.

00:29:13.198 --> 00:29:14.797
You stole from the dead!

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:16.166
But I wasn't
stealing the guitar.

00:29:16.168 --> 00:29:17.299
Guitar?

00:29:17.302 --> 00:29:18.901
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

00:29:18.903 --> 00:29:20.203
He would have
wanted me to have it.

00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:23.339
Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak
of that musician.

00:29:23.342 --> 00:29:25.074
He is dead to this family.

00:29:25.076 --> 00:29:27.043
Uh, you're all dead.

00:29:28.113 --> 00:29:30.781
I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?

00:29:30.783 --> 00:29:32.048
That's just Dante.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.185
He sure doesn't
look like an alebrije.

00:29:34.187 --> 00:29:35.785
He just looks
like a plain old dog.

00:29:35.787 --> 00:29:38.053
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

00:29:38.055 --> 00:29:41.824
Whatever he is, I am
terribly allergic.

00:29:41.826 --> 00:29:43.495
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

00:29:43.497 --> 00:29:46.197
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.101
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

00:29:51.103 --> 00:29:52.785
Oh!

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.974
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?

00:29:56.976 --> 00:29:59.075
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:01.814
Well,
since it's a family matter...

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:04.248
the way to undo a family curse

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.984
- is to get your family's blessing.
- That's it?

00:30:06.986 --> 00:30:08.386
Get your family's blessing

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:10.988
and everything should
go back to normal.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.025
But you got to do it by sunrise.

00:30:13.027 --> 00:30:14.959
What happens at sunrise?

00:30:14.961 --> 00:30:16.811
Hijole! Your hand!

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.836
Whoa, Miguel, can't have
you fainting on us.

00:30:24.838 --> 00:30:27.407
But not to worry.
Your family's here.

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:29.441
You can get
your blessing right now.

00:30:29.443 --> 00:30:34.413
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.
Aha! Perdon, senora.

00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:35.381
Oh.

00:30:35.383 --> 00:30:38.301
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

00:30:39.187 --> 00:30:40.219
Miguel.

00:30:40.221 --> 00:30:43.523
Nailed it. Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

00:30:43.525 --> 00:30:45.575
I give you my blessing.

00:30:47.997 --> 00:30:51.396
I give you my blessing
to go home...

00:30:51.398 --> 00:30:54.568
to put my photo
back on the ofrenda,

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.004
and to never play music again.

00:30:57.006 --> 00:30:58.873
What? She can't do that!

00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:02.141
Well, technically, she can
add any condition she wants.

00:31:02.144 --> 00:31:04.278
Fine.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.497
Then you hand
the petal to Miguel.

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:20.376
No skeletons!

00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:26.749
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:33.173
Two seconds and you already
break your promise.

00:31:33.175 --> 00:31:37.046
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

00:31:37.048 --> 00:31:39.115
Papa Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

00:31:39.117 --> 00:31:42.218
Tia Rosita? Oscar?

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.087
Felipe? Tia Victoria?

00:31:45.089 --> 00:31:49.492
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way or no way.

00:31:49.494 --> 00:31:51.359
You really hate music that much?

00:31:51.361 --> 00:31:54.511
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

00:31:56.936 --> 00:32:01.137
The same path he did.
He's family.

00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:02.940
Listen to your Mama Imelda.

00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:04.205
She's just looking out for you.

00:32:04.207 --> 00:32:05.274
Be reasonable.

00:32:05.276 --> 00:32:08.611
Con permiso,
I need to visit the restroom.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:10.395
Be right back.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.349
Uh, should we tell him
there are no restrooms

00:32:13.351 --> 00:32:14.667
in the Land of the Dead?

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.867
Vamonos.

00:32:28.869 --> 00:32:31.569
We got a family
looking for a living boy.

00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:34.305
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:36.375
We got to find
my great-great-grandpa.

00:32:36.377 --> 00:32:38.426
Hold it, muchacho.

00:32:42.015 --> 00:32:43.381
I found that living boy!

00:32:43.383 --> 00:32:45.617
Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:46.968
Excuse me.

00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:49.236
Oh.

00:32:52.994 --> 00:32:55.260
No, no. Dante!

00:32:55.262 --> 00:32:58.296
DisturBing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.

00:32:58.298 --> 00:33:00.166
Falsifying a unibrow.

00:33:00.168 --> 00:33:02.434
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:04.535
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.

00:33:04.537 --> 00:33:08.274
Amigo? Oh, that's so nice
to hear you say that

00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:10.075
because I have just had a...

00:33:10.077 --> 00:33:13.013
really hard Dia de Muertos
and I could really use

00:33:13.015 --> 00:33:14.014
an amigo right now.

00:33:14.016 --> 00:33:16.749
And amigos,
they help their amigos.

00:33:16.751 --> 00:33:19.451
You get me across
that bridge tonight,

00:33:19.453 --> 00:33:21.054
and I'll make it
worth your while.

00:33:21.056 --> 00:33:24.158
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.495
I can get you front row seats to
his Sunrise Spectacular show.

00:33:27.497 --> 00:33:29.697
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:31.431
You just got to let me
cross that bridge!

00:33:31.433 --> 00:33:33.601
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

00:33:33.603 --> 00:33:37.706
But my shift's almost up and I
want to visit my living family.

00:33:37.708 --> 00:33:40.423
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

00:33:41.376 --> 00:33:43.511
Can I at least
get my costume back?

00:33:43.513 --> 00:33:45.313
Uh... No.

00:33:45.315 --> 00:33:47.797
Some amigo.

00:33:50.253 --> 00:33:53.721
Hey! Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?

00:33:53.724 --> 00:33:56.357
Who wants to... Ahh!
Ay! You're alive!

00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:58.060
Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.

00:33:58.062 --> 00:34:00.127
And if I want to get back
to the Land of the Living...

00:34:00.129 --> 00:34:01.595
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

00:34:01.597 --> 00:34:03.199
That's weirdly specific.

00:34:03.201 --> 00:34:04.733
He's my great-great-grandfather.

00:34:04.735 --> 00:34:07.317
He's your Gr... What?

00:34:07.739 --> 00:34:09.670
Ugh.

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:13.525
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

00:34:14.378 --> 00:34:16.478
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.615
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

00:34:20.617 --> 00:34:22.617
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:25.353
No, no, nino! Nino, nino, I can help you.
You can help me.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:26.488
We can help each other.

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.357
But most importantly,
you can help me.

00:34:28.359 --> 00:34:29.859
- Miguel!
- I'm Hector.

00:34:29.861 --> 00:34:31.410
That's nice.

00:34:36.101 --> 00:34:37.750
Esperame, chamaco!

00:34:45.577 --> 00:34:48.146
Ay, he is going
to get himself killed.

00:34:48.148 --> 00:34:51.764
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.

00:35:03.461 --> 00:35:05.531
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

00:35:05.533 --> 00:35:08.648
Here. Nice alebrije.

00:35:21.682 --> 00:35:25.999
Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.

00:35:27.287 --> 00:35:32.423
Aqui arriba, eso...
Eh, la rayita.

00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:35.008
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

00:35:35.696 --> 00:35:37.545
Dead as a doorknob.

00:35:38.499 --> 00:35:41.601
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

00:35:41.603 --> 00:35:42.835
When you're well remembered,

00:35:42.837 --> 00:35:44.703
people put up your photo
and you get to...

00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:46.305
cross the bridge
and visit the living

00:35:46.307 --> 00:35:48.775
on Dia de Muertos.
Unless you're me.

00:35:48.777 --> 00:35:50.577
You don't get to cross over?

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:51.845
No one's ever put up my picture.

00:35:51.847 --> 00:35:53.627
But you can change that!

00:35:53.848 --> 00:35:55.614
This is you?

00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:57.251
Eh, muy guapo, eh?

00:35:57.253 --> 00:36:00.353
So, you get me
to my great-great-grandpa...

00:36:00.356 --> 00:36:03.255
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

00:36:03.257 --> 00:36:06.928
Such a smart boy! Yes!
Great idea, yes! One hiccup.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.863
De la Cruz is
a tough guy to get to

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:10.664
and I need to
cross the bridge soon.

00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:11.666
Like, tonight.

00:36:11.668 --> 00:36:13.632
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

00:36:13.635 --> 00:36:15.770
Someone a bit more,
eh, accessible?

00:36:15.772 --> 00:36:17.605
Mmm... Nope.

00:36:17.607 --> 00:36:18.939
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

00:36:18.942 --> 00:36:20.541
You got to have
some other family.

00:36:20.543 --> 00:36:21.877
Only de la Cruz.

00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:23.910
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

00:36:25.347 --> 00:36:27.783
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid.
Fine! Fine!

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:29.665
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

00:36:31.354 --> 00:36:32.820
It's not gonna
be easy, you know?

00:36:32.822 --> 00:36:35.958
He's a busy man.
What are you doing?

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.626
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.429
No. Skeletons
don't walk like that.

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:44.499
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

00:36:44.501 --> 00:36:48.438
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular?

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.239
Que padre!

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:53.376
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:54.811
to mark the end
of Dia de Muertos.

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:57.379
- And you can get us in!
- Um...

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:59.648
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.852
That... was a lie.
I apologize for that.

00:37:02.854 --> 00:37:05.021
Cool off, chamaco.
Come on. I'll get you to him.

00:37:05.023 --> 00:37:06.122
How?

00:37:06.124 --> 00:37:08.239
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:22.987
♪ Remember me
Don't let it make you cry ♪

00:37:24.276 --> 00:37:26.543
You better have
my dress, Hector.

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:27.926
Hola, Ceci.

00:37:33.753 --> 00:37:38.023
- Hola.
- Ceci, I lost the dress.

00:37:38.025 --> 00:37:39.690
Ya lo sabia!

00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:41.959
I got to dress
forty dancers by sunrise.

00:37:41.961 --> 00:37:45.829
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:49.917
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.

00:38:04.852 --> 00:38:07.168
No, no, Dante! Ven aca!

00:38:15.997 --> 00:38:17.863
You! How did you
get in here?

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:22.034
- I just followed my...
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

00:38:22.036 --> 00:38:25.004
Guider of wandering spirits.

00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:28.040
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

00:38:28.043 --> 00:38:30.409
I don't think
he's a spirit guide.

00:38:30.411 --> 00:38:31.411
Ah, ah, ah.

00:38:31.413 --> 00:38:34.481
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

00:38:34.483 --> 00:38:37.801
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:47.243
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

00:38:48.497 --> 00:38:52.666
You are the audience.
Darkness.

00:38:52.669 --> 00:38:56.887
And from the darkness,
a giant papaya.

00:38:57.842 --> 00:39:00.842
Dancers emerge from the papaya,

00:39:00.844 --> 00:39:04.913
and the dancers are all me.

00:39:04.915 --> 00:39:07.648
And they go to drink from
the milk of their mother,

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.851
who is a cactus.

00:39:08.853 --> 00:39:10.585
But who is also me.

00:39:10.587 --> 00:39:14.905
And her milk is
not milk but tears.

00:39:15.861 --> 00:39:16.925
Is it too obvious?

00:39:16.927 --> 00:39:20.661
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:24.065
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

00:39:27.472 --> 00:39:28.937
Oh! And then it could go...

00:39:34.546 --> 00:39:37.414
And what if
everything was on fire?

00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:39.615
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

00:39:39.617 --> 00:39:43.820
Inspired! You have
the spirit of an artist.

00:39:45.756 --> 00:39:48.691
The dancers exit. The music
fades, the lights go out.

00:39:48.693 --> 00:39:52.029
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

00:39:55.834 --> 00:39:57.134
Huh?

00:39:57.136 --> 00:39:59.469
He does a couple of songs, the
sun rises, everyone cheers...

00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:02.005
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

00:40:02.007 --> 00:40:04.107
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:08.027
He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower.

00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:13.651
Chamaco, you can't run off
on me like that.

00:40:13.653 --> 00:40:15.485
Stop pestering the celebrities.

00:40:15.487 --> 00:40:17.656
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

00:40:17.658 --> 00:40:20.524
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

00:40:20.526 --> 00:40:22.928
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.863
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

00:40:25.865 --> 00:40:28.734
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

00:40:28.736 --> 00:40:31.736
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:33.171
It's the hot ticket!

00:40:33.173 --> 00:40:34.774
But if you're not
on the guest list,

00:40:34.776 --> 00:40:37.210
you're never
getting in, Chorizo.

00:40:37.212 --> 00:40:40.011
Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!

00:40:40.013 --> 00:40:41.647
A-ha. Very funny, guys.
Very funny.

00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:42.882
Chorizo?

00:40:42.884 --> 00:40:45.016
Oh, this guy's famous!

00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:47.152
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

00:40:47.154 --> 00:40:48.788
I don't want to talk about it.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:51.925
He choked on some chorizo!

00:40:54.028 --> 00:40:55.762
I didn't choke, okay?

00:40:55.764 --> 00:40:57.764
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.

00:40:58.899 --> 00:41:00.534
This is why
I don't like musicians.

00:41:00.536 --> 00:41:02.168
Bunch of self-important jerks.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.671
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

00:41:04.673 --> 00:41:07.508
If you really want
to get to Ernesto,

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.908
there is that
music competition...

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.578
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.129
Winner gets
to play at his party.

00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:17.084
No, no. Chamaco,
you're loco if you think...

00:41:17.086 --> 00:41:19.520
I need to get my
great-great-grandfather's blessing!

00:41:19.522 --> 00:41:21.403
You know where
I can get a guitar?

00:41:21.991 --> 00:41:25.274
I know a guy.

00:41:36.806 --> 00:41:39.940
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

00:41:41.145 --> 00:41:43.944
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

00:41:43.946 --> 00:41:45.813
- Size seven!
- And a half.

00:41:45.816 --> 00:41:48.266
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

00:41:57.762 --> 00:41:59.695
Why the heck would
you want to be a musician?

00:41:59.697 --> 00:42:01.563
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

00:42:01.566 --> 00:42:03.098
Who spent his life
performing like a monkey

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.901
for complete strangers.

00:42:04.903 --> 00:42:07.303
No thank you.
No! Guacala!

00:42:07.305 --> 00:42:09.171
What do you know?

00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:11.575
So, how far is
this guitar anyway?

00:42:11.577 --> 00:42:12.958
We're almost there.

00:42:17.783 --> 00:42:19.363
Keep up, chamaco. Come on.

00:42:28.027 --> 00:42:32.730
- Cousin Hector!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio!

00:42:32.732 --> 00:42:33.864
¿Que onda?

00:42:33.866 --> 00:42:35.332
These people are
all your family?

00:42:35.334 --> 00:42:36.700
Uh...

00:42:36.702 --> 00:42:40.037
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas.

00:42:40.039 --> 00:42:43.174
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

00:42:43.176 --> 00:42:47.327
So, we all call each other
cousin, or tio, or whatever.

00:42:51.751 --> 00:42:54.267
- Hector!
- Tia Chelo!

00:42:56.055 --> 00:42:58.156
Muchas gracias!

00:42:58.158 --> 00:43:00.691
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharron around?

00:43:00.693 --> 00:43:01.859
Eh, in the bungalow.

00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:04.362
I don't know if he's in
the mood for visitors.

00:43:04.364 --> 00:43:07.648
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.677
Buenas noches, Chicharron!

00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:21.113
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Hector.

00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:23.182
Come on.
It's Dia de Muertos.

00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:24.784
I brought you a little offering.

00:43:24.786 --> 00:43:26.853
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

00:43:26.855 --> 00:43:29.503
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:32.358
We really need
to borrow your guitar.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.927
- My guitar?
- Yes.

00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:36.228
My prized beloved guitar?

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.063
I promise
we'll bring it right back.

00:43:38.065 --> 00:43:40.733
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:42.203
- Uh...
- Or my mini-fridge?

00:43:42.205 --> 00:43:43.938
- Ah, you see...
- Or my good napkins?

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.773
My lasso? My femur?

00:43:45.775 --> 00:43:47.006
Well, no, not like those times.

00:43:47.008 --> 00:43:49.343
Where is my femur?
You...

00:43:49.345 --> 00:43:51.345
Whoa, whoa.

00:43:51.348 --> 00:43:55.264
- You okay, amigo?
- I'm fading, Hector.

00:43:55.852 --> 00:43:58.285
I can feel it.

00:43:58.287 --> 00:44:01.471
I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

00:44:04.693 --> 00:44:07.228
You play me something.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.298
No. You know
I don't play anymore, Cheech.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.233
The guitar is for the kid.

00:44:11.235 --> 00:44:15.017
You want it, you got to earn it.

00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:19.289
Ay, only for you, amigo.

00:44:21.845 --> 00:44:23.244
Any requests?

00:44:23.246 --> 00:44:27.331
You know my favorite, Hector.

Gracias.

00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:19.499
Wait. What happened?

00:46:19.501 --> 00:46:21.536
He's been forgotten.

00:46:21.538 --> 00:46:23.102

00:46:23.104 --> 00:46:24.437
who remembers you...

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.240
you disappear from this world.

00:46:27.242 --> 00:46:30.176
We call it the final death.

00:46:30.178 --> 00:46:32.379
Where did he go?

00:46:32.381 --> 00:46:33.648
No one knows.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:37.852
But I've met him. I could
remember him when I go back!

00:46:37.854 --> 00:46:40.189
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.

00:46:40.191 --> 00:46:43.157
Our memories,
they have to be passed down

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:44.993
by those who knew us in life...

00:46:44.995 --> 00:46:48.864
in the stories
they tell about us.

00:46:48.866 --> 00:46:51.715
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

00:46:54.037 --> 00:46:56.203
Hey, it happens
to everyone eventually.

00:46:56.206 --> 00:46:59.188
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

00:47:11.289 --> 00:47:13.289
You told me you hated musicians.

00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:14.591
You never said you were one.

00:47:14.593 --> 00:47:17.059
How do you think I
knew your great-great-grandpa?

00:47:17.061 --> 00:47:18.295
We used to play music together.

00:47:18.297 --> 00:47:20.262
Taught him everything he knows.

00:47:20.264 --> 00:47:23.532
No manches! You played
with Ernesto de la Cruz...

00:47:23.534 --> 00:47:25.435
the greatest musician
of all time?

00:47:25.437 --> 00:47:27.203
Ah, you're funny.

00:47:27.205 --> 00:47:29.171
Greatest eyebrows
of all time maybe.

00:47:29.174 --> 00:47:31.173
But his music?
Eh, not so much.

00:47:31.175 --> 00:47:33.359
You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:47:35.315 --> 00:47:38.281
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!

00:47:38.283 --> 00:47:40.532
Showtime, chamaco!

00:47:46.558 --> 00:47:49.943
Llevelo!
T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

00:47:56.202 --> 00:47:59.939
Bienvenidos a todos!

00:47:59.941 --> 00:48:01.939
Oh!

00:48:01.941 --> 00:48:06.477
Who's ready for some musica?

00:48:06.479 --> 00:48:09.114
It's a battle
of the bands, amigos.

00:48:09.116 --> 00:48:12.183
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,

00:48:12.185 --> 00:48:14.218
Ernesto de la Cruz...

00:48:14.221 --> 00:48:17.056
at his fiesta tonight!

00:48:17.058 --> 00:48:18.589
That's our ticket, muchacho.

00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:20.726
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

00:48:20.728 --> 00:48:23.629
Let the competition begin!

00:48:40.148 --> 00:48:42.215
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

00:48:42.217 --> 00:48:43.615
Definitely Remember Me.

00:48:43.617 --> 00:48:45.018
No! Not that one. No.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.086
Come on.
It's his most popular song!

00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:48.388
Ah, it's too popular.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.491
♪ Remember me
Though I have to travel far ♪

00:48:50.493 --> 00:48:51.657

- What about Poco Loco?
- Epa! Now that's a song!

00:49:01.671 --> 00:49:03.572
De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:05.588
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.676
Los Chachalacos!

00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:21.789
You always this nervous
before a performance?

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:25.126
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:27.061
What? You said
you were a musician!

00:49:27.063 --> 00:49:29.031
I am!
I mean, I will be.

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:30.432
- Ay!
- Once I win.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:33.034
That's your plan?
No. You have to win.

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.603
Your life
literally depends on...

00:49:34.606 --> 00:49:36.171
you winning. And you've
never done this before!

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:37.338
I'll go up there.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.674
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:42.144
If I can't go out
and play one song,

00:49:42.146 --> 00:49:44.046
how can I call
myself a musician?

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:45.415
What does that matter?

00:49:45.417 --> 00:49:47.316
Because I don't just want to
get de la Cruz's blessing...

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:51.822
I need to prove
that I'm worthy of it.

00:49:51.824 --> 00:49:54.723
Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:57.194
at such a bad time!

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:01.763
Okay! Okay.
You want to perform?

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.567
Then you got to perform!

00:50:03.569 --> 00:50:06.571
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:12.308
Now give me your best grito.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:15.061
- My best grito?
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.

00:50:18.218 --> 00:50:21.667
Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.674
Oh, come on, kid.

00:50:39.372 --> 00:50:41.339
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

00:50:41.341 --> 00:50:43.609
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:44.809
You can do this.

00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:47.346
Grab their attention
and don't let it go.

00:50:47.348 --> 00:50:49.547
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:52.150
De la Cruzcito.

00:51:00.695 --> 00:51:03.362
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

00:51:03.364 --> 00:51:05.663
Bring back the singing dogs!

00:51:17.714 --> 00:51:20.863

about to win this thing.

00:53:24.279 --> 00:53:25.811
Damas y caballeros,

00:53:25.813 --> 00:53:27.846
I have an emergency
announcement.

00:53:27.848 --> 00:53:31.550
Please be on the lookout
for a living boy.

Answers to the name of Miguel.

00:53:33.453 --> 00:53:36.688
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.825
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

00:53:39.827 --> 00:53:41.394
Wait, wait.

00:53:41.396 --> 00:53:43.062
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

00:53:43.064 --> 00:53:44.996
The only person
who could send you home.

00:53:44.998 --> 00:53:46.164
I do have other family, but...

00:53:46.166 --> 00:53:48.434
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

00:53:48.436 --> 00:53:51.405
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

00:53:51.407 --> 00:53:53.706
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.

00:53:53.708 --> 00:53:55.708
Look at me.
I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.711
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

00:53:57.713 --> 00:53:59.079
I'm not gonna miss my one chance

00:53:59.081 --> 00:54:00.148
to cross that bridge because...

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.351
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

00:54:03.353 --> 00:54:04.450
It's not stupid!

00:54:04.452 --> 00:54:05.686
I'm taking you to your family.

00:54:05.688 --> 00:54:06.922
- Let go of me!
- You'll thank me later.

00:54:06.924 --> 00:54:10.424
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

00:54:10.426 --> 00:54:13.559
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!

00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:15.997
No!

00:54:15.999 --> 00:54:19.214
Hey, chamaco!
Where did you go?

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:24.021
Chamaco! I'm sorry!
Come back!

00:54:33.617 --> 00:54:38.485

Dante, stop it.

00:54:38.487 --> 00:54:39.902
He can't help me.

00:54:41.625 --> 00:54:42.990
Dante! Stop!

00:54:42.993 --> 00:54:45.526
Stop it! Leave me alone!

00:54:45.528 --> 00:54:47.663
You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!

00:54:47.665 --> 00:54:49.866
Now get out of here!

00:54:49.868 --> 00:54:52.668
- It's him!
- It's that living boy!

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.670
- I heard about him. Look!
- He's alive!

00:54:54.672 --> 00:54:56.320
- He's alive.
- The boy is alive!

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:08.753
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

00:55:08.755 --> 00:55:11.621
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

00:55:11.623 --> 00:55:13.272
I don't want your blessing!

00:55:14.426 --> 00:55:16.408

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.075
- You're ruining my life!
- What?

00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:33.644
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

00:55:33.646 --> 00:55:35.813
And you want to take it away.

00:55:35.816 --> 00:55:38.098

I thought you hated music.

00:55:53.067 --> 00:55:58.703
Oh, I loved it!
I remember that feeling...

00:55:58.706 --> 00:56:02.474
when my husband would play,
and I would sing

00:56:02.476 --> 00:56:05.125
and nothing else mattered.

00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:08.480
But when we had Coco,

00:56:08.482 --> 00:56:10.984
suddenly there was something
in my life that...

00:56:10.986 --> 00:56:17.123
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:20.175
He wanted to play for the world.

00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:24.631
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

00:56:24.633 --> 00:56:26.965
Now you must make a choice.

00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:29.870
But I don't want to pick sides!

00:56:29.872 --> 00:56:32.238
Why can't you be on my side?

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.507
That's what
family's supposed to do.

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:39.462

But you never will.

00:56:58.634 --> 00:57:02.003

00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:07.490
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.332

Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.

00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:49.135
Oh, the competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.

00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:01.280

00:58:20.887 --> 00:58:22.202
Oh!

00:58:28.261 --> 00:58:30.043
Oh!

00:58:31.864 --> 00:58:33.914
Look! It's Ernesto!

00:58:35.604 --> 00:58:36.918
De la Cruz!

00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:39.553
Senor de la Cruz!

00:58:41.376 --> 00:58:45.644
Pardon me! Senor de la Cruz!
Senor de la...

00:58:50.918 --> 00:58:52.319
When you see your moment,

00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:54.053
you mustn't let it pass you by.

00:58:54.055 --> 00:58:55.921
You must seize it.

00:58:55.923 --> 00:58:58.205
This one has a wise spirit.

00:59:12.774 --> 00:59:14.456
We're almost there, Dante.

00:59:17.914 --> 00:59:20.996
Senor de la Cruz!
Senor de la...

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:29.356
But what can we do?
It is hopeless...

00:59:29.358 --> 00:59:31.025
You must have faith, sister.

00:59:31.027 --> 00:59:33.326
But Padre, he will never listen.

00:59:33.329 --> 00:59:36.280
He will listen... to music.

It's you!
You are that boy!

The one who came
from the Land of the Living.

You... know about me?

01:00:58.152 --> 01:01:01.386
You are all anyone
has been talking about.

01:01:01.388 --> 01:01:03.755
Why have you come here?

01:01:03.757 --> 01:01:08.059
I'm Miguel.
Your great-great-grandson.

01:01:09.163 --> 01:01:11.529
I... have
a great-great-grandson?

01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:13.432
I need your blessing

01:01:13.434 --> 01:01:15.768
so I can go back home
and be a musician.

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:17.437
Just like you.

01:01:17.439 --> 01:01:21.273
The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

01:01:21.276 --> 01:01:24.326
But I hoped you would.

01:01:26.014 --> 01:01:30.766
My boy, with a talent like
yours, how could I not listen?

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.920
Aww!

01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:36.322
I have a great-great-grandson!

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:46.333
- Look! It's Frida!
- Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:49.353
- It is an honor, Senora.
- Gracias.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:55.343
Hey, Negrete! Infante!

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.579
Have you met
my great-great-grandson?

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:59.481
My great-great-grandson.

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:02.050
He's alive!
And a musician to boot!

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.084
Dimple. No dimple.
Dimple. No dimple.

01:02:04.086 --> 01:02:05.185
No dimple!

01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:06.623
To our friendship.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:10.507
I would move Heaven and
Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:13.494
Poison!

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.831
You know,
I did all my own stunts.

♪ Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me... ♪

01:02:21.372 --> 01:02:24.072
All of this

in the Land of the Living.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:30.513
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

01:02:30.515 --> 01:02:34.116
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:37.387
- No! It's all great!
- But?

01:02:37.389 --> 01:02:39.487
It's just...

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.891
I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

01:02:41.893 --> 01:02:45.276
You're the guy
who actually did it!

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:49.165
But did you ever regret it?

01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:52.584
Choosing music
over everything else?

01:02:53.005 --> 01:02:54.537
It was hard.

01:02:54.539 --> 01:02:58.590
Saying goodbye to my hometown.
Heading off on my own...

01:02:59.545 --> 01:03:01.546
Leaving your family?

01:03:01.548 --> 01:03:06.450
Si. But I could not have
done it differently.

01:03:06.452 --> 01:03:10.053
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

01:03:10.056 --> 01:03:14.472
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:19.398
You and I,
we are artists, Miguel.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.399
We cannot belong to one family.

01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:23.884
The world is our family.

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:28.321
Ooh! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!

01:03:38.585 --> 01:03:43.054
Soon the party will move across
town for my Sunrise Spectacular.

01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:46.025
Miguel,
you must come to the show!

01:03:46.027 --> 01:03:48.060
You will be my guest of honor!

01:03:48.062 --> 01:03:50.478
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:54.334
I can't.

01:03:54.336 --> 01:03:57.037
I have to get home
before sunrise.

01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:59.353
Oh! I really do
need to get you home.

01:04:03.346 --> 01:04:06.211
It has been an honor.

01:04:06.213 --> 01:04:08.615
I am sorry
to see you go, Miguel.

01:04:08.617 --> 01:04:10.498
I hope you die very soon.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.704
You know what I mean.

01:04:16.726 --> 01:04:19.526
Miguel, I give you my bless...

01:04:19.528 --> 01:04:21.594
We had a deal, chamaco.

01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:25.232
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

01:04:25.234 --> 01:04:28.068
Oh, Frida! I thought
you couldn't make it.

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:30.237
You said
you'd take back my photo.

01:04:30.239 --> 01:04:31.640
You promised, Miguel.

01:04:31.642 --> 01:04:33.675
You know this, uh, man?

01:04:33.677 --> 01:04:37.427
Uh, I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

01:04:37.647 --> 01:04:39.680
Hector?

01:04:39.682 --> 01:04:42.966
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.

01:04:44.987 --> 01:04:49.125
My friend,
you're being forgotten.

01:04:49.127 --> 01:04:50.758
- And whose fault is that?
- Hector, please...

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.562
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

01:04:53.564 --> 01:04:54.629
What?

01:04:54.631 --> 01:04:56.263
If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never

01:04:56.266 --> 01:04:58.134
told anyone that I wrote them!

01:04:58.136 --> 01:05:01.370
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

01:05:01.372 --> 01:05:03.271
You want to tell him
or should I?

01:05:03.273 --> 01:05:05.674
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

01:05:05.676 --> 01:05:09.244
We made a great team,
but you died...

01:05:09.246 --> 01:05:11.278
and I only sang your songs

01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:14.282
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

01:05:14.284 --> 01:05:16.018
Oh, how generous!

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.254
You really did play together.

01:05:18.256 --> 01:05:20.589
I don't want to fight about it.

01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:22.424
I just want you
to make it right.

01:05:22.426 --> 01:05:26.478
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

01:05:27.297 --> 01:05:29.197
I can see my girl.

01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:32.170
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

01:05:32.172 --> 01:05:33.704
That was a long time ago.

01:05:33.707 --> 01:05:35.338
We drank together
and you told me

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.307
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:41.279
for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.

01:05:41.281 --> 01:05:43.579
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

01:05:43.581 --> 01:05:46.316
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:48.818
In the de la Cruz movie,
El Camino a Casa.

01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:50.221
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

01:05:50.223 --> 01:05:53.058
No! It's in there. Look!

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.426
Never were truer words spoken.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:57.593
This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!

01:05:57.595 --> 01:06:00.298
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.435
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:06.386
- Salud!
- Poison!

01:06:08.342 --> 01:06:12.845
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:15.446
We'd been performing
on the road for months.

01:06:15.448 --> 01:06:16.750
I got homesick...

01:06:16.752 --> 01:06:18.533
and I packed up my songs.

01:06:19.086 --> 01:06:20.119
You want to give up now

01:06:20.121 --> 01:06:22.588
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:24.621
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

01:06:24.624 --> 01:06:26.624
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

01:06:26.626 --> 01:06:27.793
I'm going home, Ernesto.

01:06:27.795 --> 01:06:30.545
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

01:06:33.602 --> 01:06:36.870
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

01:06:36.872 --> 01:06:39.987
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

01:06:43.544 --> 01:06:44.811
To our friendship.

01:06:44.813 --> 01:06:49.430
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

01:06:53.755 --> 01:06:55.523
You walked me
to the train station.

01:06:55.525 --> 01:06:58.390
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

01:06:58.392 --> 01:07:00.661
I thought it must have been
something I ate.

01:07:00.663 --> 01:07:03.164
Perhaps it was
that chorizo, my friend.

01:07:03.167 --> 01:07:05.715
Or something I drank.

01:07:09.139 --> 01:07:10.987
I woke up dead.

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:14.842
You poisoned me.

01:07:14.844 --> 01:07:18.380
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

01:07:18.382 --> 01:07:22.031
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:27.138
I never thought that
you might have... That you...

01:07:30.929 --> 01:07:32.794
- How could you?
- Hector!

01:07:32.796 --> 01:07:34.145
Security! Security!

01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:38.883
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

01:07:39.837 --> 01:07:43.405
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:48.193
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

01:07:49.346 --> 01:07:52.681
I apologize.
Where were we?

01:07:52.683 --> 01:07:54.884
You were going to give me
your blessing.

01:07:54.886 --> 01:07:57.537
Yes. Uh, si.

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:04.294
Miguel, uh, my reputation...

01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:07.765
It is very important to me.

01:08:07.767 --> 01:08:09.867
I would hate
to have you think...

01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:13.903
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:18.641
You don't think that.
Do you?

01:08:18.643 --> 01:08:23.629
I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

01:08:29.855 --> 01:08:32.939
Papa Ernesto, my blessing?

01:08:34.894 --> 01:08:39.664
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

01:08:39.666 --> 01:08:42.802
What? But I'm your family!

01:08:42.804 --> 01:08:45.371
And Hector was my best friend.

01:08:45.373 --> 01:08:48.773
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

01:08:48.775 --> 01:08:50.942
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

01:08:50.944 --> 01:08:54.411
to seize your moment.

01:08:54.414 --> 01:08:55.996
I know you understand.

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:58.932
No! No!

01:09:00.622 --> 01:09:03.555
Let go! No!

01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:30.318
Help!
Can anyone hear me?

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.769
I want to go home.

01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:52.975
- Hector?
- Kid?

01:09:52.977 --> 01:09:55.842
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

01:09:55.844 --> 01:09:58.446
I should have gone
back to my family.

01:09:58.448 --> 01:10:01.016
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

01:10:01.018 --> 01:10:02.851
but I didn't listen.

01:10:02.853 --> 01:10:05.853
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

01:10:05.855 --> 01:10:09.425
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid ofrenda.

01:10:09.427 --> 01:10:12.328
Hey, chamaco.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:12.331 --> 01:10:14.947
I told them I didn't care.

01:10:18.636 --> 01:10:21.819
Hector! Hector?

01:10:22.506 --> 01:10:25.742
She's forgetting me.

01:10:25.744 --> 01:10:29.026
- Who?
- My daughter.

01:10:31.449 --> 01:10:35.885
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:39.389
I just wanted to see her again.

01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:42.074
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

01:10:43.128 --> 01:10:45.129
I wish I could apologize.

01:10:45.131 --> 01:10:49.132
I wish I could tell her that her
papa was trying to come home.

01:10:49.134 --> 01:10:51.718
That he loved her so much.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.954
My Coco...

01:10:57.877 --> 01:10:59.692
Coco?

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:18.895
Where did you get this?

01:11:18.898 --> 01:11:22.716
That's my Mama Coco.
That's my Mama Imelda.

01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:26.754
Is that you?

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:33.894
- We're...
- Family?

01:11:46.096 --> 01:11:48.795
I always hoped
I'd see her again.

01:11:48.797 --> 01:11:51.196
That she'd miss me.

01:11:51.198 --> 01:11:55.283
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.571
You know the worst part?

01:11:58.573 --> 01:12:00.840
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

01:12:00.842 --> 01:12:04.446
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

01:12:04.448 --> 01:12:06.162
Give her the biggest hug.

01:12:08.118 --> 01:12:11.951
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:14.222
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

01:12:14.224 --> 01:12:18.125
You disappear...
from this one.

01:12:18.127 --> 01:12:19.993
You'll never get to see her.

01:12:19.995 --> 01:12:22.012
Ever again.

01:12:25.002 --> 01:12:28.136
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

01:12:28.138 --> 01:12:32.140
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

01:12:32.143 --> 01:12:34.891
No matter how far apart we were.

01:12:35.847 --> 01:12:38.513
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

01:12:38.515 --> 01:12:41.465
one... last... time.

01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:47.189
♪ Remember me

01:12:47.191 --> 01:12:52.043
♪ Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me

01:12:52.996 --> 01:12:56.031
♪ Don't let it make you cry

01:12:56.033 --> 01:13:01.903
♪ For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart

01:13:01.906 --> 01:13:07.859

you Each night we are apart

01:13:08.781 --> 01:13:11.146

01:13:11.148 --> 01:13:12.481

travel far Remember me

01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:21.625

you hear a sad guitar

01:13:21.627 --> 01:13:27.514

01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:34.153

01:13:36.076 --> 01:13:42.829

01:13:48.587 --> 01:13:52.691
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

01:13:52.693 --> 01:13:56.327
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

01:13:56.329 --> 01:13:59.097
I didn't write Remember Me
for the world.

01:13:59.099 --> 01:14:01.016
I wrote it for Coco.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:05.704
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

01:14:05.706 --> 01:14:08.974
Are you kidding? A minute ago I
thought I was related to a murderer.

01:14:08.976 --> 01:14:11.243
You're a total upgrade.

01:14:11.245 --> 01:14:13.880
My whole life,
there's been something...

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.613
that made me different.

01:14:15.616 --> 01:14:17.900
And I never knew
where it came from.

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:22.255
But now I know.
It comes from you.

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:27.127
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.904
I'm proud to be his family!

01:14:51.853 --> 01:14:53.754
Dante?

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:56.190
Dante!

01:14:58.762 --> 01:15:00.344
It's Dante!

01:15:11.943 --> 01:15:15.226
- Imelda!
- Hector.

01:15:15.647 --> 01:15:17.228
You look good.

01:15:28.394 --> 01:15:31.661
Dante! You knew he was my
Papa Hector the whole time!

01:15:31.663 --> 01:15:33.664
You are a real spirit guide.

01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:36.198
Who's the good spirit guide?
You are!

01:15:47.112 --> 01:15:48.428
Whoa!

01:15:55.821 --> 01:15:57.369
Dante!

01:16:21.013 --> 01:16:22.315
There they are!

01:16:22.317 --> 01:16:26.667
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:31.171
Gracias, Dios mio.
Que bueno.

01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:47.306
Mijo, I was so worried!

01:16:47.308 --> 01:16:49.558
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

01:16:50.511 --> 01:16:54.047
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

01:16:54.049 --> 01:16:55.315
Imelda.

01:16:55.317 --> 01:16:58.518
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.155
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

01:17:02.158 --> 01:17:04.156
He spends five minutes with you

01:17:04.158 --> 01:17:05.892
and I have to fish him
out of a sinkhole!

01:17:05.894 --> 01:17:07.428
I wasn't in there
because of Hector.

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:10.063
He was in there because of me.

01:17:10.065 --> 01:17:12.333
He was just
trying to get me home!

01:17:12.335 --> 01:17:16.803
I didn't want to listen,
but he was right.

01:17:16.805 --> 01:17:19.088
Nothing's more
important than family.

01:17:20.043 --> 01:17:22.726
I'm ready
to accept your blessing.

01:17:23.146 --> 01:17:25.179
And your conditions.

01:17:25.181 --> 01:17:27.482
But first,
I need to find de la Cruz.

01:17:27.484 --> 01:17:29.349
To get Hector's photo.

01:17:29.351 --> 01:17:31.051
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

01:17:31.053 --> 01:17:32.953
Hector should be on our ofrenda.

01:17:32.955 --> 01:17:34.422
He's part of our family.

01:17:34.424 --> 01:17:35.890
He left this family!

01:17:35.892 --> 01:17:37.559
He tried to go home
to you and Coco.

01:17:37.561 --> 01:17:39.543
But de la Cruz murdered him!

01:17:40.497 --> 01:17:42.346
It's true, Imelda.

01:17:43.101 --> 01:17:44.566
And so what if it's true?

01:17:44.568 --> 01:17:47.069
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

01:17:47.071 --> 01:17:49.171
and I'm just
supposed to forgive you?

01:17:49.173 --> 01:17:51.105
Imelda, I...

01:17:51.107 --> 01:17:53.341
Hector!

01:17:54.946 --> 01:17:58.695
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.

01:17:59.851 --> 01:18:01.532
She's forgetting you.

01:18:02.486 --> 01:18:05.320
You don't have to forgive him.

01:18:05.322 --> 01:18:07.638
But we shouldn't forget him.

01:18:10.062 --> 01:18:13.463
I wanted to forget you.

01:18:13.465 --> 01:18:16.365
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

01:18:16.367 --> 01:18:19.418
This is my fault.
Not yours.

01:18:21.474 --> 01:18:23.622
I'm sorry, Imelda.

01:18:27.514 --> 01:18:31.248
Miguel, if we help you
get his photo,

01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:32.982
you will return home?

01:18:32.984 --> 01:18:34.567
No more music?

01:18:35.521 --> 01:18:38.171
Family comes first.

01:18:39.859 --> 01:18:43.309
I can't forgive you.

01:18:45.533 --> 01:18:47.481
But I will help you.

01:18:48.434 --> 01:18:51.417
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

01:18:52.372 --> 01:18:55.188
I might know a way.

01:19:45.593 --> 01:19:48.210
- Good luck, muchacho.
- Gracias, Frida.

01:19:56.706 --> 01:19:59.975
- Here, let me help you with...
- Don't touch me!

01:19:59.977 --> 01:20:02.243
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Hector's photo.

01:20:02.245 --> 01:20:04.078
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.930
Got your petals?

01:20:06.951 --> 01:20:08.583
Now, we just
have to find de la Cruz.

01:20:08.585 --> 01:20:09.899
Yes?

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.670
Don't I know you?

01:20:13.523 --> 01:20:16.258
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.326
- Who... Who the...
- She's talking about me!

01:20:18.328 --> 01:20:19.628
I'm the love of your life?

01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:21.396
I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.

01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:22.731
Hector!
How did you...

01:20:22.733 --> 01:20:25.668
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.

01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:28.070
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

01:20:28.072 --> 01:20:32.241
You! Wait.
You're related to Hector?

01:20:32.243 --> 01:20:33.792
The photo!

01:20:35.513 --> 01:20:37.147
Uh...

01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:38.863
After him!

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.220
Security! Ayudenme!

01:20:43.222 --> 01:20:46.289
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:47.705
That's what I heard.

01:21:01.007 --> 01:21:02.989
Places, Senor.
You're on in thirty seconds.

01:21:09.548 --> 01:21:12.466
Ay! Miguel! I have it!

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.476
Oh!

01:21:28.401 --> 01:21:30.016
Hurry! Come on!

01:21:31.405 --> 01:21:33.704
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:21:33.706 --> 01:21:39.577
the one... the only...
Ernesto de la Cruz!

01:21:48.489 --> 01:21:49.722
Get her off the stage.

01:21:58.433 --> 01:22:01.483
Sing! Sing!

I forgot what that felt like.

01:23:52.552 --> 01:23:55.168
You still got it.

01:23:56.188 --> 01:23:58.839
Oh.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.444
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

01:24:05.631 --> 01:24:09.634
To go home, to put up our photos

01:24:09.636 --> 01:24:11.403
and to never...

01:24:11.405 --> 01:24:13.820
Never play music again.

01:24:14.775 --> 01:24:19.726
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

01:24:21.949 --> 01:24:23.731
You're going home.

01:24:27.255 --> 01:24:29.256
You're not going anywhere.

01:24:30.924 --> 01:24:31.991
Imelda!

01:24:31.993 --> 01:24:33.426
Stay back!
Stay back!

01:24:33.428 --> 01:24:37.662
All of you, stay back.
Not one more step.

01:24:39.434 --> 01:24:40.950
Dante!

01:24:42.338 --> 01:24:46.640
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.

01:24:46.642 --> 01:24:48.573
I've worked too hard, Hector.

01:24:48.576 --> 01:24:50.912
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

01:24:50.914 --> 01:24:52.981
He's a living child, Ernesto.

01:24:52.983 --> 01:24:54.581
He's a threat!

01:24:54.583 --> 01:24:56.416
You think I'd let him go back

01:24:56.418 --> 01:24:58.417
to the Land of the Living
with your photo?

01:24:58.419 --> 01:25:01.490

your memory alive? No.

- I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

The greatest musician
of all time!

01:25:06.295 --> 01:25:08.263
Hector's the real musician.

01:25:08.265 --> 01:25:09.565
You're just the guy
who murdered him

01:25:09.567 --> 01:25:10.798

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.966

It's Miguel.

Here. This was
his guitar, right?

01:29:30.972 --> 01:29:32.453
He used to play it to you?
