00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:48.757
This is Agent Leland Turbo.

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:50.855
I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:55.868
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.907
You won't believe what I found out here.

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:04.307
This is bigger than anything we've ever
seen, and no one even knows it exists.

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.404
Finn, I need backup, but don't call
the cavalry, it could blow the operation.

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:10.950
- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
Let's go.

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:13.519
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:47.949
All right, buddy, we're here.

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:48.644
All right, buddy, we're here.

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:51.323
Right where you paid me to bring you.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.415
Question is, why?

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:55.993
I'm looking for a car.

00:01:56.128 --> 00:01:57.720
A car? Ha!

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:01.230
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:02.994
Exactly where I want to be.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.969
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:10.569
What are you doing out here?

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:13.236
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.247
Well, turn around
and go back where you came from.

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.317
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?

00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:23.420
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.354
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.

00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:30.253
Buddy?

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:36.124
<i>Incoming.
All workers report to the loading dock.</i>

00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:40.626
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.

00:03:42.168 --> 00:03:44.329
All right, fellas, you know the drill.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.064
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.

00:03:49.675 --> 00:03:53.236
Come on, guys. These crates
aren't gonna unload themselves.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.271
<i>Too many cars here. Out of my way.</i>

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.613
Professor ZÃ¼ndapp?

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.147
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:02.576
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:04.621
Ah, yes. Very carefully.

00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:07.020
Oh, a TV camera.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:10.617
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.

00:04:10.728 --> 00:04:12.525
What are you up to now, Professor?

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:29.242
This is valuable equipment. Make sure
it is properly secured for the voyage.

00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:31.247
<i>- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!</i>

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.840
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:38.012
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.352
Agent Leland Turbo.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.027
It's Finn McMissile!

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.092
He's seen the camera! Kill him!

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.334
<i>All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!</i>

00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:17.995
Whoa!

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.935
Waargh!

00:06:15.787 --> 00:06:17.254
What?

00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:32.599
Get to the boats!

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.095
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.663
<i>He's dead, Professor.</i>

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:39.428
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

00:07:39.537 --> 00:07:43.268
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?

00:07:43.975 --> 00:07:48.503
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who -
is here to help you.

00:07:51.582 --> 00:07:52.995
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.409
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.951
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:59.283
I thought I could make it this time, but...

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.759
Smooth like pudding, huh?

00:08:04.861 --> 00:08:08.319
Who am I kidding?
I'll always be a lemon.

00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.958
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.

00:08:12.068 --> 00:08:13.501
Hey, but look on the bright side.

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:16.901
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.

00:08:17.006 --> 00:08:20.442
You're the only one
that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:23.909
Don't sweat it. Shoot,
these things happen to everybody.

00:08:24.013 --> 00:08:27.312
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:30.784
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.

00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:32.718
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?

00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:33.853
Not yet.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:34.884
Not yet.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.517
He must be crazy excited
about winning his fourth Piston Cup.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.991
Four! Wow!

00:08:40.095 --> 00:08:43.758
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:47.062
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.

00:08:47.202 --> 00:08:48.396
Just me and...

00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:51.001
McQueen!

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:53.370
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!

00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:57.036
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!

00:08:57.179 --> 00:08:59.010
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!

00:08:59.114 --> 00:09:03.050
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!

00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:04.777
McQueen's back!

00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:07.480
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:11.149
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.487
Welcome home, soldier.

00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:14.959
The place wasn't the same without you,
son.

00:09:15.063 --> 00:09:16.360
What? Did he go somewhere?

00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:17.657
What? Did he go somewhere?

00:09:17.798 --> 00:09:21.199
It's good to be home, everybody.

00:09:21.302 --> 00:09:22.701
- Mater!
- McQueen!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.199
- Mater!
- McQueen!

00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:25.897
Oooh!

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:29.676
Whoooa!

00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:32.709
Hey,
how far did you make it this time, Otis?

00:09:32.847 --> 00:09:36.715
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!

00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:38.409
I know! I can't believe it either!

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.387
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.718
You too, buddy.

00:09:43.858 --> 00:09:47.316
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.974
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:50.488
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.143
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:55.457
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

00:09:56.436 --> 00:09:57.596
Wow.

00:09:57.737 --> 00:10:00.103
I can't believe
they renamed the Piston Cup

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.333
after our very own Doc Hudson.

00:10:03.476 --> 00:10:05.842
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:10.109
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?

00:10:13.653 --> 00:10:17.111
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.

00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:23.420
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:26.657
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:30.235
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!

00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:32.304
I can handle anything.

00:10:32.404 --> 00:10:34.133
Er... Mater?

00:10:34.273 --> 00:10:37.470
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!

00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:39.476
- Mater?
- Relax.

00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:42.138
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!

00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:44.340
Aaaah!

00:10:44.483 --> 00:10:46.474
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:48.052
Faster!

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.485
Ooh. Wow.

00:10:53.592 --> 00:10:57.050
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

00:10:57.162 --> 00:10:59.153
This is going to be good!

00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:10.537
Did you see that?

00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:14.779
Uh-oh.
This ain't going to be good.

00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:20.585
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:24.018
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.

00:11:24.156 --> 00:11:27.717
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.021
Wait till you see
what I got planned for tonight!

00:11:30.162 --> 00:11:34.496
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.933
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.

00:11:38.037 --> 00:11:41.404
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.907
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.205
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.513
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.

00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:54.583
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:56.614
OK.

00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:59.155
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:03.228
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.

00:12:03.362 --> 00:12:05.455
See you soon, amigo.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.529
Ah, this is so nice.

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:16.574
I can't tell you how good it is
to be here alone,

00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:18.472
just the two of us, finally.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.010
- You and me.
Ahem! Good evening.

00:12:21.113 --> 00:12:22.978
- Oh!
- My name is Mater,

00:12:23.082 --> 00:12:24.572
and I'll be your waiter.

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:27.345
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.

00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:29.444
Mater? You work here?

00:12:29.588 --> 00:12:31.419
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

00:12:31.523 --> 00:12:33.252
I snuck in here
when nobody was lookin'

00:12:33.392 --> 00:12:35.986
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:39.861
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?

00:12:39.998 --> 00:12:43.161
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?

00:12:43.268 --> 00:12:47.398
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:51.373
Uh... Right. Your usual.

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:01.585
<i>- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.</i>

00:13:01.687 --> 00:13:03.245
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:04.515
How should I know?

00:13:04.656 --> 00:13:07.648
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.

00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:50.692
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

00:13:51.201 --> 00:13:52.498
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:53.796
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.096
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

00:13:57.207 --> 00:14:00.665
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.

00:14:02.044 --> 00:14:03.511
And we all know
what happened to them.

00:14:03.612 --> 00:14:06.342
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

00:14:06.482 --> 00:14:09.383
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:13.249
<i>nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.</i>

00:14:13.356 --> 00:14:14.323
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

00:14:15.723 --> 00:14:17.247
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

00:14:17.358 --> 00:14:20.521
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:24.086
<i>It is an honor, Signore Dorado,
for you.</i>

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.893
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:27.524
<i>Of course we invited him,</i>

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:30.035
but apparently after his very long
racing season

00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:32.129
he is taking time off to rest.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.676
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.

00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:38.905
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:43.882
In miles, that is like...
way faster than McQueen.

00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:46.919
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

00:14:47.055 --> 00:14:49.285
<i>- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.</i>

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.687
<i>- Hello?
- Go ahead.</i>

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:54.360
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

00:14:54.462 --> 00:14:57.192
<i>That Italian feller
you got on there</i>

00:14:57.298 --> 00:14:58.193
<i>can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.</i>

00:14:58.228 --> 00:14:59.089
<i>Can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.</i>

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:02.396
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:05.300
<i>- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,</i>

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:08.307
"the bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:09.933
<i>'Cause he knows
what's important.</i>

00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:13.638
<i>Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.</i>

00:15:13.781 --> 00:15:16.807
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.645
This is not news to Francesco.

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:21.050
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:22.746
<i>After two laps, I am out cold.</i>

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:25.051
That ain't what I meant.

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:28.356
McQUEEN: What's going on
over there?

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:31.056
<i>He is afraid of Francesco.</i>

00:15:31.165 --> 00:15:33.429
McQUEEN: That's that
Italian formula car.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:36.832
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.336
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.238
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:45.777
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:48.439
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:50.111
<i>- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?</i>

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:51.641
<i>- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?</i>

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:54.311
<i>McQueen could drive circles
around you.</i>

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.389
Driving in circles is all he can-a do,
no?

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:57.456
<i>No.</i>

00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:01.220
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:02.454
Any time, any track.

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:04.461
Mel, can we move on?

00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:06.429
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:09.764
<i>a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.</i>

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:13.202
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.467
Hey! Whoa!

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.636
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:19.678
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:23.214
<i>I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.</i>

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.661
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

00:16:24.696 --> 00:16:26.007
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:28.211
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.584
Francesco knows how good he is.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:33.920
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:37.825
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.923
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.227
Not-a so fast, McQueen!

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.548
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?

00:16:44.583 --> 00:16:45.762
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.806
Motto?

00:16:49.907 --> 00:16:53.809
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

00:16:53.911 --> 00:16:57.938
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:01.448
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:04.421
Pit stop.

00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:06.854
You know what? They just got back.

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.482
Deal me in, baby.

00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:10.492
Ka-chow! Yeah.

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:11.027
Ka-chow! Yeah.

00:17:13.396 --> 00:17:16.559
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:19.361
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.

00:17:19.502 --> 00:17:21.333
Mater's going to have a blast, though.

00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:23.166
You're bringing Mater, right?

00:17:23.306 --> 00:17:25.672
You never bring him
to any of your races.

00:17:31.314 --> 00:17:32.338
Ah.

00:17:32.482 --> 00:17:34.780
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.

00:17:34.918 --> 00:17:37.182
Come on, it will be
the thrill of a lifetime for him.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.288
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.

00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:40.720
I didn't taste it!

00:17:40.823 --> 00:17:43.553
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:46.526
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.

00:17:46.629 --> 00:17:48.688
- You're coming along.
- All right!

00:17:58.575 --> 00:17:59.940
Ka-chow!

00:18:00.577 --> 00:18:01.372
Ha-ha!

00:18:01.407 --> 00:18:02.168
Ha-ha!

00:19:15.682 --> 00:19:16.378
Hey!

00:19:16.413 --> 00:19:17.074
Hey!

00:19:25.224 --> 00:19:26.953
Hey, excuse me!

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:29.027
<i>Domo arigato!</i>

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.900
Yeah!

00:20:01.494 --> 00:20:04.930
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.

00:20:05.064 --> 00:20:08.056
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:11.330
OK, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.734
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!

00:20:13.873 --> 00:20:15.017
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

00:20:15.052 --> 00:20:16.162
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

00:20:16.274 --> 00:20:17.366
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.

00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.067
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:20.838
Can you believe this party?

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:27.251
Hey.

00:20:28.553 --> 00:20:30.714
You done good. You got all the leaves.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.313
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:36.222
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

00:20:36.257 --> 00:20:37.986
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

00:20:38.295 --> 00:20:40.092
Ho-ho! Good job!

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:43.758
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

00:20:43.901 --> 00:20:45.266
You're just realizing that?

00:20:45.402 --> 00:20:48.633
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done
a number on you.

00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:51.333
Mater, things are different over here.

00:20:51.475 --> 00:20:55.502
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.

00:20:55.612 --> 00:20:58.376
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.

00:20:58.515 --> 00:21:01.075
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?

00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:03.049
That's what a tow truck does.

00:21:03.153 --> 00:21:04.745
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.

00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:07.550
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.

00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:10.285
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.

00:21:10.427 --> 00:21:13.089
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...

00:21:13.196 --> 00:21:15.289
<i>Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.</i>

00:21:15.432 --> 00:21:18.196
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.

00:21:18.335 --> 00:21:21.133
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.103
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?

00:21:23.206 --> 00:21:24.935
Anything for McQueen's friend.

00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:28.375
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.

00:21:28.512 --> 00:21:31.504
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

00:21:31.615 --> 00:21:33.708
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.

00:21:33.817 --> 00:21:35.682
Hey, she has-a good taste.

00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:39.153
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.588
You're right. She's a huge fan!

00:21:41.725 --> 00:21:44.523
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:47.893
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

00:21:47.998 --> 00:21:51.559
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.

00:21:51.668 --> 00:21:53.727
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.

00:21:53.837 --> 00:21:55.327
Yeah, er...

00:21:55.472 --> 00:21:56.996
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.041
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.

00:22:00.177 --> 00:22:01.166
Oh. Sorry.

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:04.406
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.

00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:06.948
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.451
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.

00:22:10.587 --> 00:22:12.987
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.457
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

00:22:16.593 --> 00:22:20.586
I should probably go keep an eye
on him. See you at the race.

00:22:20.697 --> 00:22:24.599
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.

00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:28.330
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:29.962
Ha! That's cute.

00:22:30.073 --> 00:22:32.337
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:33.602
No.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.972
Okay.

00:22:35.078 --> 00:22:38.570
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!

00:22:38.682 --> 00:22:43.244
<i>Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.</i>

00:22:43.387 --> 00:22:47.050
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.286
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:54.027
From Brazil, Number 8...

00:23:15.148 --> 00:23:16.809
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:19.476
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:21.280
That's because it's air-cooled.

00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:25.084
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:27.216
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.

00:23:27.327 --> 00:23:29.227
Try the canapÃ©s on the mezzanine.

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:36.895
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?

00:23:37.036 --> 00:23:39.197
It appears to be
a standard television camera.

00:23:39.305 --> 00:23:42.399
They said if you could get closer
photos next time that would be great.

00:23:42.542 --> 00:23:43.804
This was London's message?

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.105
Oh, no. No, sir.

00:23:46.246 --> 00:23:47.873
The oil platforms you were on,

00:23:47.981 --> 00:23:50.916
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.244
How did we miss that?

00:23:52.352 --> 00:23:54.320
They've scrambled
everyone's satellites.

00:23:54.454 --> 00:23:56.649
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.

00:23:56.756 --> 00:23:59.657
They placed an agent on that platform
under deep cover.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:02.887
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

00:24:02.996 --> 00:24:03.963
Great.

00:24:04.097 --> 00:24:06.429
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?

00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:07.931
Nope, not yet.

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:10.729
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.360
He'll signal you when he's ready.

00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:14.029
Good, good.

00:24:14.874 --> 00:24:16.171
Oh, no.

00:24:18.077 --> 00:24:19.942
- What is it?
- Change of plan.

00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:21.944
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?

00:24:22.081 --> 00:24:24.276
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.

00:24:24.384 --> 00:24:26.375
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.

00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:31.547
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.

00:24:31.658 --> 00:24:32.647
You are now.

00:24:36.963 --> 00:24:38.692
I'll take one of them. Thank you.

00:24:38.798 --> 00:24:41.323
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.

00:24:44.304 --> 00:24:48.297
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

00:24:49.609 --> 00:24:51.975
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.

00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:54.773
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.885
Er... little more, please.
It is free, right?

00:25:01.988 --> 00:25:04.081
Keep it coming. A little more.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.817
Come on, let's go. It's free.

00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.755
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.454
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

00:25:11.664 --> 00:25:13.393
My condolences.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.633
And now our last competitor.

00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:20.364
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

00:25:20.473 --> 00:25:21.701
Ka-chow!

00:25:21.808 --> 00:25:24.402
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.

00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:27.980
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.

00:25:28.081 --> 00:25:30.413
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.644
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism

00:25:33.753 --> 00:25:34.845
to this competition.

00:25:38.891 --> 00:25:41.018
Somebody get me water! Aah!

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.424
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.

00:25:51.104 --> 00:25:56.940
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.

00:25:57.443 --> 00:25:59.377
It has turned.

00:25:59.479 --> 00:26:01.743
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.

00:26:01.848 --> 00:26:04.544
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.

00:26:04.684 --> 00:26:07.209
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.050
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.

00:26:10.189 --> 00:26:11.816
This trip's been amazin'.

00:26:11.924 --> 00:26:14.290
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?

00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:17.760
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.

00:26:17.864 --> 00:26:20.059
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?

00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:22.667
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

00:26:22.802 --> 00:26:27.239
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.209
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.

00:26:35.047 --> 00:26:37.277
I gotta go. Oh, er...

00:26:40.086 --> 00:26:41.075
Er...

00:26:41.187 --> 00:26:43.178
Sorry, ladies.

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:46.156
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:48.955
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

00:26:49.061 --> 00:26:51.894
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!

00:26:52.031 --> 00:26:54.022
I never leak, I never leak, never...

00:26:54.133 --> 00:26:56.067
Wow-wee!

00:27:01.808 --> 00:27:03.776
What in the?

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.282
Hey, that tickles!

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:21.183
Waaargh!

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:32.635
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:39.745
OK, so, the American has activated
his tracking beacon.

00:27:39.879 --> 00:27:41.403
Roger that. Move in.

00:27:56.095 --> 00:27:57.153
Stop! Hey!

00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:18.115
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?

00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:19.980
<i>- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!</i>

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:22.747
<i>- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.</i>

00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:24.857
All right.

00:28:31.297 --> 00:28:36.257
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!

00:28:37.904 --> 00:28:40.464
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

00:28:40.573 --> 00:28:42.131
No offense to your makes and models,

00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:44.903
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy

00:28:45.011 --> 00:28:46.876
after she got left at the altar!

00:28:46.979 --> 00:28:49.209
What the? Whoa. Are you OK?

00:28:49.348 --> 00:28:51.373
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!

00:28:51.517 --> 00:28:54.953
We'd like to get to our private business
here, if you don't mind.

00:28:55.054 --> 00:28:56.521
Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:28:56.622 --> 00:28:59.113
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.

00:28:59.225 --> 00:29:02.956
Oh, a little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,

00:29:03.062 --> 00:29:04.927
you best press that green button.

00:29:05.031 --> 00:29:07.158
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.

00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:09.826
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

00:29:09.969 --> 00:29:11.368
Get out of here!

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.531
All right, then. And when she starts
gigglin', prepare to be squirted.

00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:18.307
'Scuse me, ma'am.

00:29:18.411 --> 00:29:20.311
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

00:29:20.413 --> 00:29:24.008
<i>- This cannot be him.
Is he American?</i>

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.448
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.

00:29:26.586 --> 00:29:28.918
<i>- Extremely.
- Then it's him.</i>

00:29:29.555 --> 00:29:31.022
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

00:29:31.157 --> 00:29:33.785
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

00:29:33.893 --> 00:29:36.453
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:39.326
Perfect.
Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.

00:29:39.432 --> 00:29:42.128
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.

00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:46.000
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:48.403
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them

00:29:48.507 --> 00:29:50.202
there's the Type 2 buses.

00:29:50.309 --> 00:29:52.436
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!

00:29:52.578 --> 00:29:54.273
Erm... We should find somewhere
more private.

00:29:55.247 --> 00:29:57.147
Gee, don't you think that's a little?

00:29:57.249 --> 00:30:00.275
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:02.580
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.

00:30:02.688 --> 00:30:05.452
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.

00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:06.990
We'll rendezvous then.

00:30:08.127 --> 00:30:10.891
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.793
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?

00:30:12.898 --> 00:30:14.297
Mater, what's going on?

00:30:14.433 --> 00:30:17.163
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:19.169
Guido don't believe you.

00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:22.297
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.

00:30:22.441 --> 00:30:25.410
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:27.376
See you tomorrow!

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.914
Guido still don't believe you.

00:30:32.018 --> 00:30:35.852
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.

00:30:35.955 --> 00:30:37.786
What's so funny?

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.986
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.

00:30:44.563 --> 00:30:48.090
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.

00:30:48.234 --> 00:30:49.997
So you think.

00:30:50.102 --> 00:30:52.593
Allinol by itself is good for you.

00:30:56.709 --> 00:30:59.041
But after microscopic examination

00:30:59.145 --> 00:31:01.807
I have found
that it has one small weakness.

00:31:01.914 --> 00:31:04.712
When hit with
an electromagnetic pulse,

00:31:04.817 --> 00:31:07.809
it becomes extremely dangerous.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.717
Smile for the camera.

00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:11.880
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.

00:31:11.991 --> 00:31:15.483
You were very interested in this camera
on the oil platform.

00:31:15.594 --> 00:31:19.530
Now, you will witness
what it really does.

00:31:19.665 --> 00:31:23.260
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.

00:31:23.369 --> 00:31:25.564
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.

00:31:25.705 --> 00:31:29.232
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.

00:31:29.341 --> 00:31:31.104
Could I start it now, Professor Z?

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.235
Go 50Â°% power.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.144
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:41.185
What about her? Did you give it to her?

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.585
The allinol is now heating to a boil,

00:31:44.724 --> 00:31:49.559
dramatically expanding, causing the
engine block to crack under the stress,

00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:52.129
forcing oil
into the combustion chamber.

00:31:52.231 --> 00:31:54.096
How about him? Did you talk to him?

00:31:55.568 --> 00:31:57.763
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.

00:31:57.937 --> 00:32:01.202
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse...

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.776
unfortunately...
there will be nothing to replace.

00:32:05.444 --> 00:32:07.912
How about him?
Does he have it?

00:32:11.984 --> 00:32:13.952
That's him. He's the one.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.285
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!

00:32:16.388 --> 00:32:17.412
Yes, sir.

00:32:17.556 --> 00:32:21.424
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.

00:32:21.927 --> 00:32:24.725
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.

00:32:26.232 --> 00:32:27.790
The project is still on schedule.

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:31.368
You will find the second agent
and kill him.

00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:45.107
<i>Japan, land of the rising sun,</i>

00:32:45.217 --> 00:32:47.742
<i>where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.</i>

00:32:47.853 --> 00:32:49.748
<i>Welcome to the inaugural running

<i>Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.</i>

00:32:51.754 --> 00:32:53.847
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends

00:32:53.956 --> 00:32:55.981
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

00:32:56.092 --> 00:32:57.353
There's never been a competition
like this before.

00:32:57.388 --> 00:32:58.615
There's never been a competition
like this before.

00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:00.990
First, allinol, making its debut tonight

00:33:01.095 --> 00:33:04.121
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

00:33:04.231 --> 00:33:06.062
Second, the course itself.

00:33:06.167 --> 00:33:07.345
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.524
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

00:33:08.634 --> 00:33:11.102
<i>David, how exactly
does this competition work?</i>

00:33:11.204 --> 00:33:15.436
<i>All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.</i>

00:33:15.575 --> 00:33:17.440
<i>This means that the LMP
and formula cars</i>

00:33:17.577 --> 00:33:19.977
<i>should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.</i>

00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:22.843
<i>Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.</i>

00:33:23.015 --> 00:33:25.950
<i>And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,</i>

00:33:26.052 --> 00:33:28.452
<i>like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground</i>

00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:30.556
<i>but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco</i>

00:33:30.656 --> 00:33:33.454
from absolutely running away with it.

00:33:33.593 --> 00:33:35.083
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

00:33:35.228 --> 00:33:37.059
You forget the most important factor -

00:33:37.163 --> 00:33:39.028
that early dirt track section
of the course.

00:33:39.131 --> 00:33:42.066
<i>The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.</i>

00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:44.362
<i>French rally car Raoul ÃaRoule</i>

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.563
<i>is counting on a big boost
through there.</i>

00:33:46.672 --> 00:33:48.606
<i>And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.</i>

00:33:48.708 --> 00:33:50.300
<i>His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,</i>

00:33:50.443 --> 00:33:53.037
<i>was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.</i>

00:33:53.145 --> 00:33:56.842
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

00:33:57.016 --> 00:33:59.314
Really, Darrell, you need
to clean your windshield.

00:33:59.452 --> 00:34:03.115
You're clearly not seeing this
for what it is: Francesco's race to lose.

00:34:03.256 --> 00:34:06.453
<i>It's time to find out.
The racers are locking into the grid.</i>

00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:15.678
McQUEEN: Speed. I am speed.

00:34:15.713 --> 00:34:17.691
McQUEEN: Speed. I am speed.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.201
Really? You are speed?

00:34:20.304 --> 00:34:23.239
Then Francesco is triple speed.

00:34:23.341 --> 00:34:27.038
Francesco is triple speed.

00:34:27.145 --> 00:34:28.475
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.806
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

00:34:29.914 --> 00:34:32.815
It's-a really getting him into the zone.

00:34:32.917 --> 00:34:35.852
He is so getting beat today.

00:35:05.614 --> 00:35:08.447
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!

00:35:08.551 --> 00:35:10.079
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

00:35:10.114 --> 00:35:11.608
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

00:35:19.994 --> 00:35:23.452
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.

00:35:23.564 --> 00:35:26.590
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.

00:35:26.734 --> 00:35:28.099
It must have cost him a fortune.

00:35:28.202 --> 00:35:31.296
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.

00:35:31.405 --> 00:35:33.305
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.

00:35:33.407 --> 00:35:36.570
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.

00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:41.148
<i>As they head into the palace
hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.</i>

00:35:41.248 --> 00:35:43.739
<i>Hang on, boys.
Here comes the dirt.</i>

00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:45.375
<i>Slipping and sliding, baby.</i>

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:47.111
McQueen,
it's time to make your move!

00:35:48.488 --> 00:35:50.615
Get on the outside
and show 'im what Doc taught you.

00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:53.185
10-4, Mater.

00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:57.228
<i>Oh, boy! Francesco's brought
to a screeching halt!</i>

00:35:57.364 --> 00:36:00.561
<i>Lightning McQueen
is the first to take advantage.</i>

00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:04.299
<i>And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.</i>

00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:07.602
McQUEEN: Nice call, Mater.
Keep it up.

00:36:07.637 --> 00:36:08.998
McQUEEN: Nice call, Mater.
Keep it up.

00:36:09.108 --> 00:36:10.575
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

00:36:10.677 --> 00:36:13.737
<i>McQueen looks happier than a roll bar
at a demolition derby!</i>

00:36:15.448 --> 00:36:18.576
<i>Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.</i>

00:36:18.685 --> 00:36:21.210
<i>Francesco lost a lot of momentum
in the dirt.</i>

00:36:26.626 --> 00:36:30.528
<i>He's got serious work ahead of
him if he wants to get back in this race.</i>

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.623
<i>The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.</i>

00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:49.574
<i>It is time.
- Roger that.</i>

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.590
<i>Oh!
Miguel Camino has blown an engine!</i>

00:36:59.692 --> 00:37:02.957
<i>Very unusual, Darrell.
He's been so consistent all year.</i>

00:37:04.697 --> 00:37:06.392
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

00:37:06.499 --> 00:37:08.763
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?

00:37:08.868 --> 00:37:11.029
The one the American agent
passed the device to.

00:37:11.204 --> 00:37:13.468
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!

00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:15.301
Not for long.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.642
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?

00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:20.425
The Pacer from the party last night.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.104
The Pacer from the party last night.

00:37:21.847 --> 00:37:24.907
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.677
Yep. His VIN numbers match.

00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:28.685
Anyone with him?
He won't be alone.

00:37:29.621 --> 00:37:32.613
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.

00:37:32.724 --> 00:37:36.524
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...

00:37:36.962 --> 00:37:38.896
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?

00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:40.623
<i>Get him out of the pits. Now!</i>

00:37:40.732 --> 00:37:43.530
Wow! Some of them fellers
is really loud!

00:37:43.668 --> 00:37:46.034
<i>Can you hear me? Over.
- What?</i>

00:37:46.138 --> 00:37:48.800
<i>Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?</i>

00:37:48.907 --> 00:37:52.343
Hey. I know you! You're that girl
from the party last night.

00:37:52.477 --> 00:37:54.206
You wanna do our date now?

00:37:54.312 --> 00:37:57.247
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:59.283
<i>Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!</i>

00:37:59.384 --> 00:38:00.510
Ha-ha-ha!

00:38:00.652 --> 00:38:03.712
<i>There's no time for
messing about! Get out of the pits!</i>

00:38:03.855 --> 00:38:07.291
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?

00:38:07.392 --> 00:38:10.520
<i>You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!</i>

00:38:10.662 --> 00:38:12.926
I'm trying. Get out now.

00:38:13.065 --> 00:38:17.126
I usually like to have a proper detailin'
done before I meet a lady friend.

00:38:21.106 --> 00:38:22.073
Huh?

00:38:24.543 --> 00:38:27.512
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.

00:38:40.158 --> 00:38:41.557
Miss Shiftwell?

00:38:41.693 --> 00:38:43.957
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.

00:38:44.095 --> 00:38:46.393
Multiple assailants
are closing in quickly.

00:38:46.531 --> 00:38:48.499
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

00:38:50.835 --> 00:38:52.860
Hey, new lady friend,
you like flowers?

00:38:52.971 --> 00:38:53.938
What?

00:38:54.038 --> 00:38:56.506
No! Don't go in anywhere.
Just keep moving.

00:38:56.608 --> 00:38:58.576
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?

00:38:59.777 --> 00:39:01.904
<i>Whoa! McQueen
suddenly moves to the outside.</i>

00:39:04.382 --> 00:39:06.077
<i>I cannot believe what I saw.</i>

00:39:06.184 --> 00:39:09.017
<i>That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!</i>

00:39:09.153 --> 00:39:11.018
<i>That might have cost McQueen
the victory!</i>

00:39:30.174 --> 00:39:32.802
This time, I'm going to make sure
you stay dead!

00:39:34.012 --> 00:39:36.378
<i>You're doing brilliantly.
Now just stay focused.</i>

00:39:36.481 --> 00:39:38.949
What's that? You want me
to head toward that ruckus?

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.018
<i>No! Don't go down that street.</i>

00:39:46.357 --> 00:39:47.324
Ohh!

00:39:51.863 --> 00:39:52.852
Hi-yah!

00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:55.361
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:57.764
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

00:40:00.505 --> 00:40:01.870
Aaargh!

00:40:04.976 --> 00:40:06.739
<i>And here they come,
the two leaders.</i>

00:40:06.844 --> 00:40:09.142
<i>Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!</i>

00:40:15.253 --> 00:40:17.380
<i>- It's close!
Francesco's the winner!</i>

00:40:17.488 --> 00:40:19.080
<i>McQueen's number two.</i>

00:40:21.426 --> 00:40:24.486
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?

00:40:30.868 --> 00:40:32.267
Where'd he go?

00:40:32.437 --> 00:40:35.372
<i>Our rendezvous has been
jeopardized. Keep the device safe.</i>

00:40:35.473 --> 00:40:38.840
<i>- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?</i>

00:40:44.248 --> 00:40:45.875
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.

00:40:46.017 --> 00:40:47.484
What was your strategy today?

00:40:47.618 --> 00:40:50.382
<i>Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.</i>

00:40:50.488 --> 00:40:51.614
It's-a very simple.

00:40:51.723 --> 00:40:55.716
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.124
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.

00:40:58.262 --> 00:41:00.492
You were in trouble
for a while.

00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:02.531
That dirt track section
had you crawling.

00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:05.379
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

00:41:05.414 --> 00:41:08.092
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

00:41:09.237 --> 00:41:12.070
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?

00:41:12.174 --> 00:41:14.199
Is the race over? You won, right?

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:16.675
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?

00:41:16.778 --> 00:41:20.646
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:23.047
No, that's 'cause I seen
these two fellers doing

00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:25.210
some karate street performance.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.754
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.

00:41:27.889 --> 00:41:30.289
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?

00:41:30.459 --> 00:41:33.155
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.

00:41:33.295 --> 00:41:34.819
Your date?

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.956
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.159
- What?
- Wait a minute.

00:41:40.302 --> 00:41:43.897
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!

00:41:44.005 --> 00:41:46.473
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

00:41:46.575 --> 00:41:49.567
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?

00:41:49.711 --> 00:41:52.942
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things.

00:41:53.081 --> 00:41:55.140
Maybe if I, I don't know,

00:41:55.283 --> 00:41:58.480
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.

00:41:58.587 --> 00:42:02.045
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!

00:42:03.158 --> 00:42:04.955
Hey, there he is!

00:42:06.727 --> 00:42:09.491
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?

00:42:09.597 --> 00:42:11.155
I made a mistake.

00:42:11.332 --> 00:42:13.131
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:14.930
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:21.097
<i>Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.</i>

00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:26.206
<i>Lightning McQueen loses
in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli</i>

00:42:26.345 --> 00:42:28.779
<i>in the first race of the World Grand Prix.</i>

00:42:28.914 --> 00:42:31.712
<i>And three - count 'em -
three cars flamed out</i>

00:42:31.817 --> 00:42:35.378
<i>leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.</i>

00:42:35.554 --> 00:42:38.955
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.

00:42:39.058 --> 00:42:42.494
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.

00:42:42.595 --> 00:42:45.996
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,

00:42:46.132 --> 00:42:47.394
but one thing's for sure,

00:42:47.566 --> 00:42:50.000
<i>Lightning McQueen blew this race.</i>

00:42:50.136 --> 00:42:52.696
<i>Team McQueen
can't be happy right now.</i>

00:43:01.613 --> 00:43:05.208
<i>Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.</i>

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:26.668
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.

00:43:26.805 --> 00:43:29.569
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.

00:43:29.674 --> 00:43:31.539
This is about my hook, ain't it?

00:43:31.643 --> 00:43:34.544
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.

00:43:34.646 --> 00:43:37.080
Look. It's attached to me.

00:43:37.215 --> 00:43:40.548
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

00:43:40.652 --> 00:43:42.882
I never properly introduced myself.

00:43:43.021 --> 00:43:45.387
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.357
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.054
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?

00:43:51.196 --> 00:43:54.188
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.

00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:56.460
I know some karate.

00:43:56.635 --> 00:44:00.093
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.

00:44:00.238 --> 00:44:03.173
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.

00:44:03.275 --> 00:44:06.108
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood

00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:08.974
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.210
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once. "

00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:15.013
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.088
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!

00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:19.924
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:23.622
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.

00:44:23.728 --> 00:44:25.923
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!

00:44:26.064 --> 00:44:27.725
Hang on!

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.061
Whoa-hah-hah!

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.330
This is first-class service.

00:44:33.471 --> 00:44:36.065
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!

00:44:37.642 --> 00:44:39.735
Your karate partners is back there.

00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:42.005
They look like
they tryin' to catch up!

00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:44.604
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:49.515
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:01.299
Whoa...

00:45:07.806 --> 00:45:09.273
Is everything okay back there?

00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:11.433
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.

00:45:11.543 --> 00:45:13.238
<i>Roger that.</i>

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.308
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?

00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:24.954
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.081
Thanks, old boy.

00:45:27.192 --> 00:45:29.387
- You got it, mate.
Hey, doggonit!

00:45:29.527 --> 00:45:31.392
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!

00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:33.053
Come on! Get in here!

00:45:33.164 --> 00:45:36.861
I tell you what, you really do
want this first date, don't ya?

00:45:36.968 --> 00:45:38.993
That's a no-quit attitude right there.

00:45:39.137 --> 00:45:40.468
What the?

00:45:43.375 --> 00:45:45.468
- Aargh!
Hold on, Sid.

00:45:55.153 --> 00:45:56.120
Aargh!

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.286
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.735
Hold on!

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:16.338
<i>By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.</i>

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:18.238
<i>By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.</i>

00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:20.335
<i>I'm so sorry for what I did.</i>

00:46:20.443 --> 00:46:23.503
McQUEEN: "I don't want to be
the cause of you losing any more races.

00:46:23.613 --> 00:46:27.140
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.583
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world.

00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:33.154
"Your best friend, Mater. "

00:46:33.256 --> 00:46:35.224
I didn't really want him to leave.

00:46:35.358 --> 00:46:37.622
Wait, there's more here.

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:40.456
"PS. Please tell the hotel

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.792
"I didn't mean to order that movie.

00:46:42.899 --> 00:46:47.529
"I thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize I was paying for it.

00:46:47.637 --> 00:46:50.629
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:52.169
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

00:46:52.204 --> 00:46:53.564
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

00:46:53.675 --> 00:46:57.202
Well, at least I know
if he's at home, he'll be safe.

00:46:59.414 --> 00:47:01.314
That's how I like to start the day.

00:47:01.416 --> 00:47:04.044
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.

00:47:04.186 --> 00:47:06.177
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.

00:47:06.288 --> 00:47:07.516
Whoa!

00:47:07.622 --> 00:47:10.250
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.

00:47:10.392 --> 00:47:11.238
That was... Oh!

00:47:11.273 --> 00:47:12.084
That was... Oh!

00:47:12.693 --> 00:47:15.821
- Still in one piece? Great.
I've got to go to a doctor.

00:47:15.996 --> 00:47:18.328
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.

00:47:18.432 --> 00:47:21.595
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.

00:47:21.702 --> 00:47:23.670
This here is Finn McSomethin'
or other.

00:47:23.804 --> 00:47:26.637
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.

00:47:27.374 --> 00:47:30.002
And, Finn, this here is my date.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.771
I never did get your name.

00:47:31.878 --> 00:47:33.440
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

00:47:33.475 --> 00:47:35.003
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

00:47:35.113 --> 00:47:36.478
It's Shiftwell. Holley...

00:47:37.983 --> 00:47:40.747
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.

00:47:41.453 --> 00:47:43.250
What is this?

00:47:43.388 --> 00:47:46.050
That's one of the worst engines
ever made.

00:47:46.191 --> 00:47:48.504
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:50.818
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

00:47:50.995 --> 00:47:54.158
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what.

00:47:54.265 --> 00:47:56.028
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

00:47:56.133 --> 00:47:58.795
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?

00:47:58.903 --> 00:48:01.428
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture,
ain't it?

00:48:01.539 --> 00:48:03.063
- But you took it.
- Holley.

00:48:03.207 --> 00:48:05.175
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.

00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:08.370
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.

00:48:08.479 --> 00:48:11.573
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...

00:48:11.682 --> 00:48:16.016
<i>Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!</i>

00:48:16.287 --> 00:48:19.279
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!

00:48:19.423 --> 00:48:22.483
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?

00:48:22.626 --> 00:48:26.118
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.

00:48:26.263 --> 00:48:29.630
At least 35,000 cars were made
with this engine.

00:48:29.733 --> 00:48:31.894
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.

00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:35.197
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:37.707
This seems like a dead end.

00:48:38.642 --> 00:48:42.408
If there was something in the photo that
could narrow this down, I'd be happier.

00:48:42.513 --> 00:48:45.277
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.

00:48:45.382 --> 00:48:47.680
See how he's had most of his parts
replaced?

00:48:47.785 --> 00:48:49.650
And see all them boxes over there?

00:48:49.753 --> 00:48:52.586
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.

00:48:52.756 --> 00:48:54.169
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

00:48:54.204 --> 00:48:55.582
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

00:48:55.859 --> 00:48:57.417
Exactly.

00:48:57.528 --> 00:49:00.326
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.

00:49:00.464 --> 00:49:04.127
I know of a black-market parts dealer
in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,

00:49:04.268 --> 00:49:07.829
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.

00:49:07.938 --> 00:49:11.567
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?

00:49:11.708 --> 00:49:12.732
Wait. What?

00:49:12.876 --> 00:49:15.037
You obviously have experience
in the field.

00:49:15.145 --> 00:49:17.375
Yeah, I live right next to one.

00:49:17.948 --> 00:49:19.506
I don't know.

00:49:19.616 --> 00:49:22.449
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.

00:49:22.553 --> 00:49:24.646
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.

00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:26.881
Well... Okay.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.117
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?

00:49:29.226 --> 00:49:32.491
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.

00:49:32.696 --> 00:49:34.288
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?

00:49:34.398 --> 00:49:35.865
<i>Paris. Tout de suite.</i>

00:49:35.966 --> 00:49:38.526
Yeah, two of them sweets for me,
too, Sid.

00:49:38.635 --> 00:49:40.569
I always wanted to be a spy.

00:49:40.704 --> 00:49:42.296
Really? Me, too.

00:49:42.406 --> 00:49:45.398
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?

00:50:06.029 --> 00:50:07.326
Ha ha ha!

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.005
Once we're inside, stay close.

00:50:18.175 --> 00:50:21.440
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.

00:50:21.578 --> 00:50:22.806
Got it.

00:50:22.946 --> 00:50:24.846
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,

00:50:24.982 --> 00:50:27.815
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?

00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:29.748
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

00:50:30.654 --> 00:50:32.519
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?

00:50:32.623 --> 00:50:35.786
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?

00:50:35.893 --> 00:50:37.758
Why would I...

00:50:37.861 --> 00:50:39.351
Dad-gum.

00:50:39.463 --> 00:50:42.432
<i>- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.</i>

00:50:42.566 --> 00:50:44.466
They got everything here. No!

00:50:44.601 --> 00:50:46.967
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.731
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!

00:50:50.908 --> 00:50:53.672
Wow. Whoa. He-he!

00:50:54.311 --> 00:50:56.279
Do what?

00:50:57.314 --> 00:51:00.010
Excuse me. What are you selling?

00:51:00.184 --> 00:51:01.879
<i>Headlights, monsieur, headlights?</i>

00:51:02.019 --> 00:51:03.748
- What in the?
- Two for one.

00:51:03.854 --> 00:51:05.412
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!

00:51:10.327 --> 00:51:13.558
There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.

00:51:13.664 --> 00:51:15.632
<i>- Mater, get back!
- ImbÃ©cile!</i>

00:51:22.906 --> 00:51:24.237
Hey, wait for me!

00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:42.415
Ahhhhhh!

00:51:47.497 --> 00:51:48.987
Ag-g-g-h!

00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:51.294
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...

00:51:51.435 --> 00:51:53.426
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.

00:51:53.537 --> 00:51:55.505
Sure thing.

00:51:56.139 --> 00:51:59.006
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!

00:52:07.551 --> 00:52:09.485
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

00:52:09.586 --> 00:52:13.420
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.

00:52:13.523 --> 00:52:15.491
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?

00:52:15.859 --> 00:52:17.417
I never liked new car smell.

00:52:18.462 --> 00:52:21.295
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound

00:52:21.398 --> 00:52:24.299
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.

00:52:24.401 --> 00:52:28.030
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up
there in mileage, aren't you?

00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:31.107
All right, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old.

00:52:31.275 --> 00:52:33.436
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:37.370
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.

00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:41.780
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.

00:52:41.917 --> 00:52:43.942
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

00:52:44.086 --> 00:52:46.054
They should. I sold them.

00:52:46.155 --> 00:52:47.645
To whom?
- No idea.

00:52:47.757 --> 00:52:51.158
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.654
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.

00:52:54.764 --> 00:52:55.625
Now I know.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.487
Now I know.

00:52:56.598 --> 00:52:58.725
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.

00:52:58.834 --> 00:53:01.860
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.029
Lemons is a tow truck's
bread and butter.

00:53:04.172 --> 00:53:06.970
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party

00:53:07.075 --> 00:53:08.599
and the race and the airport.

00:53:08.743 --> 00:53:10.734
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.

00:53:10.846 --> 00:53:13.212
I want to know what other type of cars
were out there.

00:53:13.348 --> 00:53:17.011
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:18.813
Are these cars considered lemons?

00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:20.852
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

00:53:20.956 --> 00:53:24.892
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.

00:53:25.026 --> 00:53:28.052
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

00:53:28.563 --> 00:53:31.054
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?

00:53:31.233 --> 00:53:34.691
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo
and Trunkov never get together,

00:53:34.836 --> 00:53:37.396
but they are having a secret meeting
in two days.

00:53:37.506 --> 00:53:40.634
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.

00:53:40.742 --> 00:53:42.403
That's where the next race is!

00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:45.207
There's a good chance
our mystery engine will be there, too.

00:53:45.313 --> 00:53:47.281
Your chances are more than good.

00:53:47.382 --> 00:53:50.943
I just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday. To Porto Corsa.

00:53:51.586 --> 00:53:54.612
Contact Stevenson
and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.

00:53:54.723 --> 00:53:56.122
Good work.

00:54:00.996 --> 00:54:04.898
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.436
You never see this many lemons
in one town.

00:54:09.104 --> 00:54:10.901
'Less there's a swap meet.

00:54:11.006 --> 00:54:12.769
How'd you get all them pictures?

00:54:12.874 --> 00:54:16.503
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.

00:54:17.112 --> 00:54:21.640
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.650
Thank you... I think.

00:54:23.752 --> 00:54:27.279
That's a familiar sight.
A Hugo being towed.

00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:29.152
But he looks absolutely perfect!

00:54:29.324 --> 00:54:32.316
Of course! They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

00:54:32.427 --> 00:54:35.328
Makes sense. If I was rich
and broke down every day,

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.728
I'd hire me to tow me
around all the time, too!

00:54:37.832 --> 00:54:41.734
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.

00:54:41.836 --> 00:54:44.304
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!

00:54:50.612 --> 00:54:52.580
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

00:54:52.781 --> 00:54:53.975
Thank you, Finn.

00:54:54.115 --> 00:54:55.912
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.

00:55:02.422 --> 00:55:04.788
LUIGl: Guido,
your eyes do not deceive you.

00:55:04.925 --> 00:55:07.917
We are in Italy. We are home.

00:55:08.361 --> 00:55:11.194
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?

00:55:11.364 --> 00:55:15.528
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

00:55:15.635 --> 00:55:19.401
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!

00:55:19.573 --> 00:55:22.303
Luigi! Guido!

00:55:32.619 --> 00:55:34.450
How do they do it?

00:55:34.588 --> 00:55:37.853
These are the same ingredients
as back home, but it tastes so good.

00:55:37.991 --> 00:55:40.789
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.661
Hey, race car.

00:55:45.799 --> 00:55:47.733
You look so down, so low.

00:55:47.834 --> 00:55:49.734
Is like you have flat tires.

00:55:54.274 --> 00:55:56.037
She said you look like you are starving,

00:55:56.142 --> 00:55:58.576
that she's gonna make you a big meal
and fatten you up.

00:55:58.712 --> 00:55:59.872
Oh, no.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.949
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.

00:56:03.516 --> 00:56:05.177
<i>Capisco. I understand.</i>

00:56:05.318 --> 00:56:08.082
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?

00:56:08.521 --> 00:56:09.647
How did you know that?

00:56:09.756 --> 00:56:12.919
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.

00:56:14.494 --> 00:56:15.518
That, and Luigi told me.

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.758
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.

00:56:19.899 --> 00:56:22.231
I brought my friend Mater along
on the trip

00:56:22.335 --> 00:56:24.565
and I told him he needed
to act different,

00:56:24.671 --> 00:56:26.195
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

00:56:26.339 --> 00:56:28.307
This Mater is a close friend?

00:56:28.742 --> 00:56:30.471
He's my best friend.

00:56:30.577 --> 00:56:33.011
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

00:56:37.817 --> 00:56:39.409
What did I do?

00:56:39.519 --> 00:56:41.419
I said some things during our fight.

00:56:41.554 --> 00:56:44.580
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me,

00:56:44.691 --> 00:56:47.524
they would fight over everything.

00:56:48.028 --> 00:56:51.361
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,

00:56:51.631 --> 00:56:54.327
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.

00:56:54.434 --> 00:56:56.834
There were even
some non-Ferrari fights.

00:56:57.804 --> 00:57:00.398
<i>So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight.</i>

00:57:01.007 --> 00:57:04.738
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends.

00:57:05.645 --> 00:57:07.374
"But you got to make up fast.

00:57:07.547 --> 00:57:10.038
"No fight more important
than friendship. "

00:57:19.059 --> 00:57:23.428
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

00:57:23.596 --> 00:57:25.530
<i>Now, mangia. Eat!</i>

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.269
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

00:57:39.412 --> 00:57:41.141
Thank you, Stevenson.

00:57:41.247 --> 00:57:43.545
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:46.278
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

00:57:46.419 --> 00:57:49.183
But everything's voice-activated
these days.

00:57:49.289 --> 00:57:52.588
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.

00:57:52.692 --> 00:57:55.422
<i>Voice recognized.
Disguise program initiated.</i>

00:57:56.062 --> 00:57:57.154
Cool!

00:57:57.263 --> 00:57:59.231
Computer, make me a German truck.

00:57:59.432 --> 00:58:02.424
<i>- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.</i>

00:58:02.602 --> 00:58:03.660
Make me a monster truck!

00:58:03.803 --> 00:58:05.668
<i>- Request acknowledged.
- What the?</i>

00:58:05.805 --> 00:58:08.035
I vant to siphon your gas!

00:58:08.908 --> 00:58:11.172
<i>- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.</i>

00:58:13.313 --> 00:58:15.713
<i>- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.</i>

00:58:18.017 --> 00:58:21.043
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.

00:58:21.154 --> 00:58:23.418
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.

00:58:23.523 --> 00:58:26.287
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.

00:58:26.426 --> 00:58:27.422
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

00:58:27.457 --> 00:58:28.419
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:34.398
That's no good. Hm.

00:58:37.435 --> 00:58:38.925
Hey. What are you doin'?

00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:42.903
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.907
For a second there, I thought
you was tryin' to fix my dents.

00:58:46.043 --> 00:58:48.409
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.

00:58:48.512 --> 00:58:52.346
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

00:58:52.483 --> 00:58:55.884
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?

00:58:55.986 --> 00:59:00.013
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

00:59:00.124 --> 00:59:03.685
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.

00:59:03.794 --> 00:59:09.130
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

00:59:09.266 --> 00:59:12.235
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.

00:59:12.336 --> 00:59:14.327
But my line of work
is towin' and salvage.

00:59:14.472 --> 00:59:17.498
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.

00:59:17.675 --> 00:59:20.974
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.

00:59:21.111 --> 00:59:23.511
- Oh...
- In the meantime...

00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:27.384
<i>...you look a little light on weapons.</i>

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.690
<i>You are looking live
at beautiful</i>

00:59:38.796 --> 00:59:41.128
<i>Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.</i>

00:59:41.232 --> 00:59:46.220
<i>What a magnificent setting for the
second race of the World Grand Prix!</i>

00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:49.294
<i>Well Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"</i>

00:59:49.397 --> 00:59:51.024
<i>and it's easy to see why.</i>

00:59:51.132 --> 00:59:53.828
<i>With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,</i>

00:59:53.935 --> 00:59:56.768
<i>Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.</i>

00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:59.101
<i>And everyone who's anyone
is here today,</i>

00:59:59.941 --> 01:00:01.966
<i>from the ultra-rich and super-famous</i>

01:00:02.077 --> 01:00:04.443
<i>to world leaders
and important dignitaries.</i>

01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:06.275
<i>You aren't kidding, David.</i>

01:00:06.414 --> 01:00:09.679
<i>You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.</i>

01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:11.516
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,

01:00:11.551 --> 01:00:13.214
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,

01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:15.787
where the big news
continues to be allinol.

01:00:15.888 --> 01:00:18.686
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press
earlier today

01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:21.020
to answer questions about its safety.

01:00:21.127 --> 01:00:23.823
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:25.921
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

01:00:26.065 --> 01:00:27.532
Safe. There it is.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.292
So the race will go on, folks.

01:00:29.435 --> 01:00:31.130
But the question everyone is asking:

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:33.898
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.032
<i>He'd better.
Talk about a home track advantage.</i>

01:00:37.143 --> 01:00:40.044
<i>Francesco Bernoulli
grew up racing on this course.</i>

01:00:40.146 --> 01:00:45.015
<i>Signore e signori, in the
pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!</i>

01:00:45.117 --> 01:00:48.245
<i>Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!</i>

01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:49.599
And your big mistake, McQueen!

01:00:49.634 --> 01:00:50.845
And your big mistake, McQueen!

01:00:50.956 --> 01:00:52.947
<i>In secondo position,</i>

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:55.921
<i>numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!</i>

01:00:55.956 --> 01:00:58.385
<i>Numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!</i>

01:00:58.496 --> 01:01:00.157
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?

01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:04.064
If you're worried about your fuel, man,
don't. It's perfectly safe.

01:01:04.836 --> 01:01:06.248
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

01:01:06.283 --> 01:01:07.660
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

01:01:07.771 --> 01:01:09.705
Francesco understands, McQueen.

01:01:09.806 --> 01:01:11.740
Oh, great, here it comes.

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:13.775
What do you got, Francesco?

01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:17.176
For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,

01:01:17.314 --> 01:01:20.249
to be far away from home is not easy.

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:23.478
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.

01:01:23.587 --> 01:01:25.111
Is-a no insult.

01:01:25.222 --> 01:01:28.157
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,

01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:29.687
<i>just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.</i>

01:01:29.722 --> 01:01:31.083
<i>Just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.</i>

01:01:31.193 --> 01:01:34.185
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:38.494
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.

01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:40.466
Mama!

01:01:40.569 --> 01:01:44.596
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.

01:01:44.774 --> 01:01:47.140
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

01:01:47.243 --> 01:01:50.235
And there's the insult we were missing.

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.896
<i>Darrell, the racers
are settling in as they head</i>

01:02:09.997 --> 01:02:11.294
<i>to the Italian countryside.</i>

01:02:11.399 --> 01:02:13.333
<i>Whoo, boy!</i>

01:02:13.434 --> 01:02:15.959
<i>This is gonna be a great race.</i>

01:02:28.249 --> 01:02:31.184
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.

01:02:31.285 --> 01:02:33.344
Look like someone stole their trunks.

01:02:38.259 --> 01:02:40.557
My grand-a father has-a broken down.

01:02:40.661 --> 01:02:44.461
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.

01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:47.591
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.

01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:49.932
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.

01:02:50.037 --> 01:02:51.971
Don't-a fight over me.

01:02:52.073 --> 01:02:54.940
<i>Signore Tow Truck, per favore.</i>

01:02:55.042 --> 01:02:57.943
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.

01:02:59.447 --> 01:03:02.177
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?

01:03:02.283 --> 01:03:03.807
<i>Impossible.</i>

01:03:03.918 --> 01:03:05.943
<i>Just apply the same level of dedication</i>

01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:09.489
<i>you've been using to play
the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.</i>

01:03:09.624 --> 01:03:13.890
It's just that them guys look purty tough
and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?

01:03:14.028 --> 01:03:17.020
<i>- Is that how you see me?
That's how everyone sees you.</i>

01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:18.564
<i>Isn't that the idea?</i>

01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:20.600
<i>I tell you, that's the genius of it.</i>

01:03:20.701 --> 01:03:22.692
<i>No one realizes they're being fooled</i>

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:25.430
<i>because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.</i>

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.030
<i>Brilliant!</i>

01:03:30.144 --> 01:03:32.237
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...

01:03:32.346 --> 01:03:35.179
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.312
<i>- Computer, disguise!
Request acknowledged.</i>

01:03:43.624 --> 01:03:46.388
It's the boss. He's coming.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.324
Ivan.

01:03:54.335 --> 01:03:55.927
Oh, er...

01:03:56.070 --> 01:04:00.507
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:10.315
He's in.

01:04:12.887 --> 01:04:15.515
<i>The racers are now
making their way around the hairpin</i>

01:04:15.656 --> 01:04:18.318
<i>and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge.</i>

01:04:34.775 --> 01:04:36.333
No more bets, please.

01:04:36.477 --> 01:04:37.967
Come on, fuzzy dice!

01:04:38.112 --> 01:04:40.046
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!

01:04:40.147 --> 01:04:42.081
Air freshener. Antenna balls.

01:04:42.183 --> 01:04:43.946
Spark-a plugs.

01:04:44.085 --> 01:04:46.451
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!

01:04:46.554 --> 01:04:49.785
<i>That's because it is.
Now, be careful what you say.</i>

01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:51.891
Why is that?

01:04:51.993 --> 01:04:53.927
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

01:04:54.028 --> 01:04:56.394
You want me to stop talkin' to ya
right now?

01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.929
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

01:04:59.299 --> 01:05:02.132
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:05.467
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex. "

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:07.506
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.

01:05:07.608 --> 01:05:11.601
But that makes sense, seein's how
you's wanted in France, Germany...

01:05:11.745 --> 01:05:12.708
Mater, stop it!

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:13.671
Mater, stop it!

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.111
OK, OK, keep your voice down!

01:05:15.214 --> 01:05:17.148
You gonna make me arrested!

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.741
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.

01:05:19.852 --> 01:05:21.547
He's so good!

01:05:23.122 --> 01:05:23.984
Victor!

01:05:24.019 --> 01:05:24.847
Victor!

01:05:25.491 --> 01:05:26.458
Hey, Victor!

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.327
- There you are!
- Come in!

01:05:29.428 --> 01:05:33.558
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.

01:05:33.666 --> 01:05:35.395
It's good to see you.

01:05:35.535 --> 01:05:37.366
Is the big boss here yet?

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:40.564
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.

01:05:44.477 --> 01:05:46.445
Here we go.

01:05:48.781 --> 01:05:50.146
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

01:05:50.249 --> 01:05:52.217
It's just the professor.

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:53.943
ZÃ¼ndapp! When is he coming?

01:05:54.053 --> 01:05:56.021
He's already here.

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:00.257
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:00.458
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:03.655
<i>I wish I could be with you
on this very special day,</i>

01:06:03.795 --> 01:06:05.786
<i>but my clutch assembly broke.</i>

01:06:05.897 --> 01:06:07.990
<i>- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.</i>

01:06:08.099 --> 01:06:09.726
We know how you feel.

01:06:09.834 --> 01:06:11.995
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.

01:06:12.103 --> 01:06:14.196
Oh, it's too sophisticated.

01:06:14.306 --> 01:06:16.274
<i>We are here to celebrate.</i>

01:06:16.841 --> 01:06:18.809
<i>Today, all your hard work pays off.</i>

01:06:19.911 --> 01:06:22.607
<i>The world turned their backs
on cars like us.</i>

01:06:22.714 --> 01:06:26.150
<i>They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.</i>

01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:30.688
<i>The only thing they haven't stopped
doing is laughing at us.</i>

01:06:31.456 --> 01:06:35.756
<i>They've called us terrible names:
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap,</i>

01:06:36.328 --> 01:06:40.025
<i>clunker, junker, beater,
wreck, rattletrap,</i>

01:06:41.399 --> 01:06:42.661
<i>lemon.</i>

01:06:42.801 --> 01:06:45.065
<i>But their insults just give us strength.</i>

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:51.397
<i>Because today, my friends,
that all ends!</i>

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.669
<i>There's smoke
on the casino bridge!</i>

01:06:54.812 --> 01:06:55.801
Oh, no!

01:06:55.913 --> 01:06:57.471
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.385
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.

01:07:06.557 --> 01:07:08.388
<i>They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.</i>

01:07:08.423 --> 01:07:10.219
<i>They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.</i>

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:15.487
<i>Another crash!
It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.</i>

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:17.861
<i>Embrace your inner lemon.</i>

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.594
<i>Let it drive you.</i>

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:23.103
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

01:07:27.077 --> 01:07:28.908
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:30.808
On the tower!

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:37.276
<i>This was meant to
be alternative fuel's greatest moment.</i>

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:41.221
<i>But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.</i>

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.804
<i>And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve</i>

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:46.284
<i>And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve</i>

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.590
<i>will become the most powerful cars
in the world!</i>

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.621
Get out of the way!

01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:27.949
<i>They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.</i>

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:30.032
<i>They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.</i>

01:08:37.245 --> 01:08:38.576
Huh? Whoa!

01:08:39.447 --> 01:08:41.415
We figured you might stop by!

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:46.780
<i>And they will finally respect us!</i>

01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:48.890
<i>So hold your hoods high!</i>

01:08:49.224 --> 01:08:52.216
<i>After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!</i>

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:54.507
No!

01:08:54.542 --> 01:08:55.352
No!

01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:56.891
<i>Long live lemons!</i>

01:08:56.926 --> 01:08:58.321
<i>Long live lemons!</i>

01:08:58.432 --> 01:09:00.764
<i>Number 7 is loose!
Shu Todoroki!</i>

01:09:24.758 --> 01:09:25.986
Finn?

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.420
<i>Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!</i>

01:09:29.563 --> 01:09:31.463
<i>McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!</i>

01:09:31.565 --> 01:09:32.778
<i>They have no idea
what happened behind them.</i>

01:09:32.813 --> 01:09:33.992
<i>They have no idea
what happened behind them.</i>

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.567
This is impossible!

01:09:35.668 --> 01:09:37.568
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.433
What happened?

01:09:39.572 --> 01:09:42.234
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:44.235
Oh, no!

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:53.845
<i>Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?</i>

01:09:53.987 --> 01:09:55.887
<i>I suppose that...</i>

01:09:56.022 --> 01:09:59.253
<i>The show must go on,
as they say.</i>

01:09:59.392 --> 01:10:01.417
I can't believe this is really happening!

01:10:01.527 --> 01:10:02.619
Quiet!

01:10:02.729 --> 01:10:05.789
<i>Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?</i>

01:10:05.899 --> 01:10:10.700
<i>I cannot, in good conscience, continue
to risk the lives of any more race cars.</i>

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:13.233
<i>The final race will not be run on allinol.</i>

01:10:13.268 --> 01:10:15.130
<i>The final race will not be run on allinol.</i>

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.902
<i>There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod</i>

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:22.106
<i>announcing that he will not require
the cars to use allinol for the final race.</i>

01:10:22.281 --> 01:10:23.578
A toast!

01:10:23.682 --> 01:10:27.311
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

01:10:27.453 --> 01:10:30.286
Mater, abort the mission.

01:10:30.422 --> 01:10:33.789
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.255
How is your grandfather?

01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:38.295
Long live lemons!

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.728
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?

01:10:40.866 --> 01:10:42.629
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.

01:10:42.734 --> 01:10:44.793
You are not leaving, are you?

01:10:44.903 --> 01:10:46.837
Uh... of course I ain't leaving.

01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:47.801
<i>- McQUEEN ON TV: I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?</i>

01:10:47.836 --> 01:10:48.664
<i>- McQUEEN ON TV: I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?</i>

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.474
<i>Crashes are a part of racing, I know,</i>

01:10:51.576 --> 01:10:53.171
<i>but something like that
should never happen.</i>

01:10:53.206 --> 01:10:54.767
<i>But something like that
should never happen.</i>

01:10:54.878 --> 01:10:58.370
<i>You can choose your fuel
for the final race. What it'll be?</i>

01:10:58.482 --> 01:10:59.949
<i>Allinol.</i>

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.311
<i>After today?</i>

01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:04.352
<i>My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.</i>

01:11:04.488 --> 01:11:06.854
<i>I didn't stand by a friend of mine
recently.</i>

01:11:06.957 --> 01:11:09.118
<i>I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.</i>

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:12.159
<i>So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.</i>

01:11:12.329 --> 01:11:15.924
<i>He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.</i>

01:11:16.066 --> 01:11:18.728
<i>...till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.</i>

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.933
Allinol must be finished for good.

01:11:23.607 --> 01:11:25.973
McQueen cannot win the last race.

01:11:26.743 --> 01:11:28.973
Lightning McQueen must be killed!

01:11:29.112 --> 01:11:30.340
No!

01:11:37.487 --> 01:11:39.352
It's the American spy!

01:11:40.824 --> 01:11:41.916
Dad-gum!

01:11:42.025 --> 01:11:44.084
<i>Gatling gun.

01:12:05.816 --> 01:12:07.340
Whoa!

01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:13.378
McQueen!

01:12:17.994 --> 01:12:19.052
Whoa! What's this?

01:12:19.429 --> 01:12:20.487
Whoa!

01:12:24.734 --> 01:12:26.429
McQueen! McQueen!

01:12:29.539 --> 01:12:30.506
Waagh!

01:12:33.076 --> 01:12:34.907
Let me through! Let me through!

01:12:35.044 --> 01:12:37.410
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!

01:12:37.513 --> 01:12:39.447
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.

01:12:39.615 --> 01:12:41.014
We have a lunatic at gate 9.

01:12:41.117 --> 01:12:44.883
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting

01:12:45.021 --> 01:12:48.013
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!

01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:50.786
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!

01:12:50.893 --> 01:12:53.054
<i>- You are the champion!
- This way, signore.</i>

01:12:53.162 --> 01:12:55.096
McQueen!

01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:57.631
McQueen.
- Give us a pose!

01:12:57.734 --> 01:13:00.032
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!

01:13:00.136 --> 01:13:01.281
Where you going?

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:02.426
Where you going?

01:13:02.537 --> 01:13:03.504
Stop!

01:13:03.772 --> 01:13:06.138
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...

01:13:06.274 --> 01:13:07.434
Mater!

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:09.066
<i>- Mater?

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:11.236
McQueen!
They're gonna kill you!

01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:12.711
McQUEEN: Mater!

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.109
Excuse me.

01:13:14.249 --> 01:13:16.012
No, where are you going?

01:13:16.117 --> 01:13:17.846
<i>Scusi. Mater!</i>

01:13:17.952 --> 01:13:19.476
<i>- McQueen!
- Scusi.</i>

01:13:19.654 --> 01:13:22.054
Mater! Mater!

01:13:22.157 --> 01:13:24.091
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.

01:13:24.192 --> 01:13:27.252
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.

01:13:27.362 --> 01:13:28.954
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...

01:13:29.097 --> 01:13:33.056
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best. "

01:13:33.168 --> 01:13:35.898
<i>- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.</i>

01:13:36.004 --> 01:13:37.972
I really thought I heard my friend.

01:13:39.808 --> 01:13:43.141
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:46.476
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.

01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:48.071
Come-a with me, please.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.651
Let me go!

01:13:53.755 --> 01:13:55.848
You actually care about that race car.

01:13:56.357 --> 01:13:58.325
A pity you didn't warn him in time.

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:08.067
<i>"Idiot"?
Is that how you see me?</i>

01:14:08.169 --> 01:14:11.195
<i>That's how everyone sees you.
I tell you, that's the genius of it.</i>

01:14:11.339 --> 01:14:13.330
<i>No one realizes they're being fooled</i>

01:14:13.441 --> 01:14:16.171
<i>because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.</i>

01:14:16.311 --> 01:14:18.279
<i>At the fool...</i>

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.543
Excuse me!

01:14:20.715 --> 01:14:22.580
<i>Domo arigato!</i>

01:14:22.684 --> 01:14:23.345
Yeah!

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.006
Yeah!

01:14:26.386 --> 01:14:28.183
You done good. You got all the leaves.

01:14:28.321 --> 01:14:30.789
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.

01:14:30.924 --> 01:14:32.420
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

01:14:32.455 --> 01:14:33.917
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

01:14:34.326 --> 01:14:36.556
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

01:14:39.965 --> 01:14:41.364
Aargh!

01:14:43.168 --> 01:14:46.399
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.

01:14:46.538 --> 01:14:47.835
Mater!

01:14:52.778 --> 01:14:54.609
But I never leak oil. Never.

01:14:54.713 --> 01:14:55.909
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

01:14:55.944 --> 01:14:57.106
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

01:14:57.415 --> 01:14:59.576
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?

01:14:59.751 --> 01:15:02.986
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...

01:15:03.086 --> 01:15:04.747
I don't need your help!

01:15:04.854 --> 01:15:06.788
I don't want your help.

01:15:06.889 --> 01:15:08.857
Your help...

01:15:09.492 --> 01:15:11.426
Bang the gong. Get it on!

01:15:11.561 --> 01:15:13.586
<i>McQUEEN: Listen,
this isn't Radiator Springs.</i>

01:15:13.763 --> 01:15:17.028
This is exactly why I don't bring
you along to these things!

01:15:28.011 --> 01:15:30.605
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.977
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.

01:15:39.655 --> 01:15:41.384
Whoa!

01:15:41.657 --> 01:15:42.783
Whoa!

01:15:50.066 --> 01:15:52.000
Oh, this... This is all my fault.

01:15:52.101 --> 01:15:54.035
Don't be a fool, Mater.

01:15:54.137 --> 01:15:56.071
But I am, remember? You said so.

01:15:56.205 --> 01:15:58.105
When did I... Oh.

01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:02.200
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.

01:16:02.311 --> 01:16:04.108
I'm not a spy!

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.650
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time.

01:16:09.819 --> 01:16:11.878
I really am just a tow truck.

01:16:12.021 --> 01:16:13.852
Finn, he's not joking.

01:16:13.956 --> 01:16:17.824
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

01:16:17.927 --> 01:16:21.260
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.

01:16:22.065 --> 01:16:24.033
This is all my fault.

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:29.900
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.

01:16:30.039 --> 01:16:32.667
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,

01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:34.707
for the death of Lightning McQueen.

01:16:34.877 --> 01:16:37.903
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.

01:16:42.418 --> 01:16:43.385
Whoa!

01:16:43.886 --> 01:16:44.944
Huh?

01:16:50.859 --> 01:16:53.726
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.

01:16:53.895 --> 01:16:56.090
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.

01:16:56.197 --> 01:16:58.290
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

01:16:58.399 --> 01:17:01.368
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.

01:17:01.503 --> 01:17:03.130
You just need
to focus on the race.

01:17:03.271 --> 01:17:05.831
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...

01:17:07.075 --> 01:17:09.373
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:17:09.511 --> 01:17:12.639
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.

01:17:12.747 --> 01:17:17.684
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.

01:17:17.786 --> 01:17:18.775
Listen...

01:17:18.887 --> 01:17:22.254
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.

01:17:22.357 --> 01:17:25.588
You show the world
that they've been wrong about allinol.

01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:27.523
Mater would want you to race.

01:17:27.558 --> 01:17:28.685
Mater would want you to race.

01:17:29.529 --> 01:17:31.463
All right. For Mater.

01:18:05.799 --> 01:18:07.232
Here he comes.

01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:27.547
<i>What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.</i>

01:18:27.654 --> 01:18:29.781
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.

01:18:29.956 --> 01:18:33.050
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?

01:18:33.193 --> 01:18:34.660
- You broke it!
- Quiet!

01:18:34.795 --> 01:18:37.161
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?

01:18:37.264 --> 01:18:40.165
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?

01:18:40.267 --> 01:18:42.235
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

01:18:42.602 --> 01:18:45.969
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"...

01:18:46.073 --> 01:18:48.041
he's going to go "ka-boom"!

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:52.444
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.

01:18:52.579 --> 01:18:54.740
Oh, wait, you could have!

01:18:54.848 --> 01:18:57.248
<i>- Dad-gum lemons!
Request acknowledged.</i>

01:18:57.984 --> 01:19:00.475
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?

01:19:03.724 --> 01:19:05.817
That's right! You got nothing!

01:19:06.893 --> 01:19:08.827
Who's the lemon now, huh?

01:19:11.798 --> 01:19:13.390
Nice try, Mater.

01:19:14.201 --> 01:19:17.602
<i>- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...</i>

01:19:18.405 --> 01:19:19.838
Mater!

01:19:25.078 --> 01:19:26.807
I got to get y'all out of there.

01:19:26.913 --> 01:19:29.279
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.

01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:31.680
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

01:19:31.818 --> 01:19:34.218
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.

01:19:34.321 --> 01:19:36.812
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?

01:19:36.923 --> 01:19:40.324
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.

01:19:49.069 --> 01:19:51.003
So, we'll be OK? Really?

01:19:51.104 --> 01:19:53.664
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.

01:19:53.774 --> 01:19:55.139
Argh!

01:19:55.275 --> 01:19:56.833
Being killed by a clock.

01:19:56.943 --> 01:19:59.673
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come. "

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:01.748
Time? That's it!

01:20:09.923 --> 01:20:12.551
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.

01:20:16.096 --> 01:20:19.122
If I can just reverse the polarity.

01:20:22.803 --> 01:20:24.737
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.

01:20:31.812 --> 01:20:34.679
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?

01:20:36.716 --> 01:20:38.445
Oh, no!

01:20:38.552 --> 01:20:40.520
Drive! Burn rubber!

01:20:47.294 --> 01:20:49.262
We've got to get to the course.

01:20:49.996 --> 01:20:52.089
Calculate the fastest way to...

01:20:53.633 --> 01:20:54.657
Done.

01:20:54.768 --> 01:20:56.463
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.

01:20:56.570 --> 01:21:00.301
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.

01:21:02.241 --> 01:21:03.654
Oh, no, that's Mater's.

01:21:03.689 --> 01:21:05.067
Oh, no, that's Mater's.

01:21:05.177 --> 01:21:06.144
I knew his escape was too easy.

01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:18.320
Come back here! Stop!

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.371
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

01:21:23.406 --> 01:21:24.682
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

01:21:24.794 --> 01:21:26.256
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

01:21:26.291 --> 01:21:27.719
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:30.094
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?

01:21:30.199 --> 01:21:32.793
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.

01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:34.835
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?

01:21:36.472 --> 01:21:38.540
<i>Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.</i>

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.538
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

01:21:40.573 --> 01:21:42.437
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

01:21:42.609 --> 01:21:45.976
<i>When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.</i>

01:21:48.415 --> 01:21:50.975
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!

01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:53.949
Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.

01:21:54.054 --> 01:21:55.715
Don't come any closer!
McQUEEN: Are you OK?

01:21:55.823 --> 01:21:57.791
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!

01:21:58.592 --> 01:21:59.991
McQUEEN: No, wait! Wait!

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.960
<i>A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!</i>

01:22:04.665 --> 01:22:05.757
Mater, wait!

01:22:07.133 --> 01:22:09.966
Normally an emergency vehicle on the
track means there's been an accident.

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:12.732
<i>- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!</i>

01:22:12.839 --> 01:22:16.605
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!

01:22:16.776 --> 01:22:20.610
McQUEEN: I know I made you feel that
way before, but none of that matters!

01:22:20.713 --> 01:22:22.203
We're best friends!

01:22:24.217 --> 01:22:25.878
<i>And McQueen
seems to be having</i>

01:22:25.985 --> 01:22:27.782
<i>a conversation with the tow truck.</i>

01:22:27.887 --> 01:22:30.583
<i>I don't know who
that truck is, Brent, but tell you what,</i>

01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:33.022
<i>he's got to be the world's best
backwards driver.</i>

01:22:33.993 --> 01:22:36.962
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!

01:22:37.063 --> 01:22:40.590
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:44.158
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.704
- Stay away!
- No! Never!

01:22:49.008 --> 01:22:50.566
Almost there.

01:22:50.677 --> 01:22:54.443
I'm not letting you get away again!

01:22:55.248 --> 01:22:58.445
<i>- Got to keep away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged.</i>

01:22:58.551 --> 01:23:00.382
Oh, my gosh.

01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:15.433
What is happening? It's a bad dream!

01:23:16.968 --> 01:23:19.436
<i>And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,</i>

01:23:19.538 --> 01:23:21.938
<i>hooked to the now rocket-propelled
tow truck.</i>

01:23:24.142 --> 01:23:25.473
Gargh!

01:23:30.115 --> 01:23:30.993
Aagh!

01:23:31.028 --> 01:23:31.871
Aagh!

01:23:35.718 --> 01:23:37.242
The Professor's on the run!

01:23:37.353 --> 01:23:39.878
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!

01:23:41.357 --> 01:23:44.019
- Holley, I'll get ZÃ¼ndapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!

01:23:47.864 --> 01:23:49.832
What is happening?

01:24:03.913 --> 01:24:05.312
Hurry, Professor.

01:24:17.093 --> 01:24:19.891
You really think I'm going to let you
float away, Professor?

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:49.391
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!

01:24:51.861 --> 01:24:53.954
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:03.503
Give it up, McMissile.

01:25:19.856 --> 01:25:23.314
Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.

01:25:29.265 --> 01:25:30.596
Oh, no.

01:25:51.888 --> 01:25:53.266
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

01:25:53.301 --> 01:25:54.645
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

01:25:54.756 --> 01:25:55.723
Bomb?

01:25:55.824 --> 01:25:57.792
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.

01:25:57.892 --> 01:25:59.388
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

01:25:59.423 --> 01:26:00.885
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:04.197
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?

01:26:04.299 --> 01:26:05.596
Death ray?

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.997
Turn off the bomb, ZÃ¼ndapp!

01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:09.592
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.

01:26:09.704 --> 01:26:11.797
Everything is voice-activated
these days.

01:26:11.906 --> 01:26:13.070
Deactivate! Deactivate!

01:26:13.105 --> 01:26:14.235
Deactivate! Deactivate!

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:15.968
<i>Voice denied.</i>

01:26:17.745 --> 01:26:19.235
- Huh!
- Oops.

01:26:19.413 --> 01:26:21.847
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed

01:26:21.949 --> 01:26:23.644
by the one who activated it?

01:26:23.984 --> 01:26:25.884
- Say it.
- Deactivate.

01:26:26.887 --> 01:26:28.320
<i>Voice denied.</i>

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:34.818
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?

01:26:35.762 --> 01:26:38.060
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.

01:26:38.164 --> 01:26:41.691
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.

01:26:42.135 --> 01:26:45.866
I'm going out on a limb here. These are
the guys that want me dead, correct?

01:26:45.972 --> 01:26:48.440
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.

01:26:48.542 --> 01:26:52.501
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.

01:26:53.747 --> 01:26:56.875
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams

01:26:56.983 --> 01:26:59.417
ain't gonna make you feel better.

01:27:00.287 --> 01:27:02.255
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

01:27:11.598 --> 01:27:12.724
Pit stop.

01:27:17.003 --> 01:27:18.971
Not today, boys.

01:27:28.615 --> 01:27:29.582
Retreat!

01:27:32.552 --> 01:27:34.247
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

01:27:34.354 --> 01:27:36.686
Anything for one of Pop's mates.

01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:44.763
What's he saying? What's wrong?

01:27:44.898 --> 01:27:46.866
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

01:27:49.202 --> 01:27:51.136
I get it. I get it!

01:27:51.237 --> 01:27:53.535
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.767
What? No. I can't do it.

01:27:55.909 --> 01:27:57.809
Nobody takes me seriously.

01:27:57.944 --> 01:28:01.004
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.

01:28:01.147 --> 01:28:02.808
Yes, it is.

01:28:03.116 --> 01:28:05.710
Look, you're yourself
in Radiator Springs.

01:28:05.819 --> 01:28:07.753
Be yourself here.

01:28:07.854 --> 01:28:09.822
And if people aren't taking you
seriously,

01:28:09.923 --> 01:28:12.517
then they need to change, not you.

01:28:12.626 --> 01:28:14.719
I know that
because I was wrong before.

01:28:15.395 --> 01:28:17.386
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.

01:28:17.564 --> 01:28:19.156
Thanks, buddy.

01:28:19.265 --> 01:28:21.733
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!

01:28:21.835 --> 01:28:23.803
Oh, right. Hang on!

01:28:25.538 --> 01:28:27.506
Where's he going?

01:28:29.175 --> 01:28:31.109
<i>- Computer!
Yes, Agent Mater?</i>

01:28:31.211 --> 01:28:34.044
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.374
<i>Request acknowledged.</i>

01:28:38.952 --> 01:28:41.113
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!

01:28:41.221 --> 01:28:43.155
The second kind, not the first!

01:28:43.256 --> 01:28:45.053
<i>Deploying chute.</i>

01:29:08.848 --> 01:29:10.406
Who's winning the race?

01:29:14.788 --> 01:29:17.222
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!

01:29:17.323 --> 01:29:19.450
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.

01:29:19.626 --> 01:29:21.093
Okay.

01:29:21.227 --> 01:29:22.694
Somebody's been sabotaging

01:29:22.796 --> 01:29:25.060
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.

01:29:25.198 --> 01:29:26.893
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.

01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:29.001
Bomb! It's a bomb!

01:29:29.736 --> 01:29:32.204
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!

01:29:34.441 --> 01:29:36.375
Get off the stage! Move it!

01:29:36.476 --> 01:29:39.445
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

01:29:39.612 --> 01:29:42.911
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

01:29:43.049 --> 01:29:45.779
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

01:29:45.885 --> 01:29:47.819
Mater, just cut to the chase.

01:29:47.921 --> 01:29:49.855
Okay. It's him.

01:29:49.956 --> 01:29:52.982
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

01:29:53.093 --> 01:29:55.027
I figured it out when I realized

01:29:55.128 --> 01:29:58.586
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts -

01:29:58.698 --> 01:30:02.065
the same bolts that hold together that
old British engine from the photograph.

01:30:03.434 --> 01:30:04.662
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.

01:30:05.136 --> 01:30:07.730
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:

01:30:07.872 --> 01:30:10.466
If there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.

01:30:10.641 --> 01:30:12.506
What is he talking about?

01:30:12.677 --> 01:30:15.202
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

01:30:15.313 --> 01:30:16.940
You just blamed it on me.

01:30:17.081 --> 01:30:19.606
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

01:30:19.717 --> 01:30:22.948
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

01:30:24.122 --> 01:30:26.955
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

01:30:27.358 --> 01:30:28.854
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

01:30:28.889 --> 01:30:30.351
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:32.687
Stay away!

01:30:32.796 --> 01:30:36.664
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

01:30:36.767 --> 01:30:40.259
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:42.895
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

01:30:43.006 --> 01:30:47.033
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!

01:30:47.144 --> 01:30:49.977
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

01:30:50.247 --> 01:30:52.579
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.

01:30:53.717 --> 01:30:55.514
Mater, he created allinol.

01:30:55.685 --> 01:30:57.346
But what if he found that huge oil field

01:30:57.487 --> 01:30:59.955
just as the world was trying to find
something else?

01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:03.890
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

01:31:03.994 --> 01:31:06.792
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?

01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:08.989
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.

01:31:09.132 --> 01:31:12.192
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

01:31:12.335 --> 01:31:14.132
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!

01:31:15.005 --> 01:31:17.496
- Mater!
- Someone do something!

01:31:20.177 --> 01:31:21.390
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

01:31:21.425 --> 01:31:22.603
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

01:31:24.313 --> 01:31:28.340
<i>Bomb deactivated.
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.</i>

01:31:36.191 --> 01:31:39.024
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:40.406
How did the tow truck figure it out?

01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:41.652
How did the tow truck figure it out?

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:45.062
It's official. You're coming to
all my races from now on.

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.134
Now you're talkin'!

01:31:50.472 --> 01:31:52.372
Hyeeugh!

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:57.807
Mater, let's go. You're on.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.514
Your Majesty, may I present

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:08.578
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm...

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:12.158
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.228
Go get 'em, buddy.

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:26.636
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:31.541
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:33.876
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir"
business.

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.006
By the way, have y'all met each other?

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.846
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:39.886
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.

01:32:45.858 --> 01:32:48.850
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,

01:32:48.961 --> 01:32:50.895
McQueen hanging on for dear life

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:54.932
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.795
We was goners.

01:32:56.902 --> 01:33:00.065
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car

01:33:00.172 --> 01:33:02.140
swoops in from the sky to save us!

01:33:02.274 --> 01:33:05.209
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

01:33:05.311 --> 01:33:07.245
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!

01:33:07.346 --> 01:33:11.146
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

01:33:11.283 --> 01:33:14.741
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.

01:33:14.887 --> 01:33:16.684
Holley! What are you doin' here?

01:33:16.789 --> 01:33:19.690
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.

01:33:19.792 --> 01:33:20.759
Finn!

01:33:20.859 --> 01:33:22.952
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communiquÃ©.

01:33:23.128 --> 01:33:24.823
So you got-a my email.

01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:27.330
Y'all is going to have a great time!

01:33:27.466 --> 01:33:31.300
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.

01:33:31.403 --> 01:33:32.529
Don't tell nobody.

01:33:32.671 --> 01:33:34.639
And this is Holley Shiftwell.

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.708
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.

01:33:36.809 --> 01:33:38.743
It's so nice to meet you all.

01:33:38.877 --> 01:33:41.038
Guido believe you now.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:43.740
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.

01:33:43.882 --> 01:33:45.679
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in

01:33:45.784 --> 01:33:47.581
and you saved them in London?

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.688
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!

01:33:49.788 --> 01:33:54.452
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.586
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.

01:33:57.730 --> 01:34:00.494
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

01:34:01.767 --> 01:34:05.931
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.

01:34:06.038 --> 01:34:07.801
Those two are perfect for each other.

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:10.408
There's one thing I still don't get.

01:34:10.542 --> 01:34:13.340
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?

01:34:13.445 --> 01:34:17.074
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?

01:34:17.216 --> 01:34:19.309
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.

01:34:19.418 --> 01:34:22.410
Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline

01:34:22.554 --> 01:34:25.819
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:29.985
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!

01:34:32.531 --> 01:34:37.594
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

01:34:37.736 --> 01:34:41.570
with my all-natural, sustainable,
organic biofuel

01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:47.010
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!

01:34:47.146 --> 01:34:49.171
It was him!

01:34:49.281 --> 01:34:53.308
Once big oil, always big oil, man.

01:34:53.419 --> 01:34:54.818
Tree-hugger.

01:34:55.754 --> 01:34:59.246
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.

01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:01.655
All spectators, clear the starting line.

01:35:04.563 --> 01:35:07.031
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!

01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:08.758
We should do this every year.

01:35:08.867 --> 01:35:11.961
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.

01:35:12.071 --> 01:35:14.596
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

01:35:14.707 --> 01:35:18.268
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.

01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.971
<i>- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- Signorina Sally.</i>

01:35:22.081 --> 01:35:23.412
It is official.

01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:26.040
Lightning McQueen
is the luckiest car in the world.

01:35:26.185 --> 01:35:28.244
Why, thank you.

01:35:28.387 --> 01:35:31.447
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:34.616
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.192
Just something I had made up
for the occasion.

01:35:37.596 --> 01:35:39.564
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.

01:35:39.665 --> 01:35:42.463
Was-a funnier when I did it,
but it's-a very funny.

01:35:42.601 --> 01:35:45.798
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?

01:35:45.904 --> 01:35:47.599
Try it. You'll like it.

01:35:47.706 --> 01:35:49.867
So, he's not so good-looking.

01:35:50.008 --> 01:35:52.306
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!

01:35:52.444 --> 01:35:54.639
That's why I love you, Sally.

01:35:54.747 --> 01:35:57.511
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!

01:35:57.649 --> 01:36:01.449
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!

01:36:01.553 --> 01:36:03.077
And those open wheels.

01:36:03.222 --> 01:36:06.191
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

01:36:17.636 --> 01:36:18.796
Go, Lightning!

01:36:37.322 --> 01:36:38.949
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!

01:36:39.091 --> 01:36:41.025
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!

01:36:41.126 --> 01:36:44.459
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!

01:36:44.563 --> 01:36:46.963
Finn? Time to go.

01:36:47.099 --> 01:36:49.329
Siddeley's gassed, geared
and ready to fly.

01:36:50.202 --> 01:36:53.330
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.

01:36:53.472 --> 01:36:55.770
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.

01:36:56.909 --> 01:37:00.572
Somethin' tells me you're not
talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.

01:37:00.712 --> 01:37:03.044
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.

01:37:03.148 --> 01:37:06.481
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.

01:37:06.585 --> 01:37:10.248
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.

01:37:10.389 --> 01:37:13.722
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.

01:37:13.826 --> 01:37:16.920
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...

01:37:17.029 --> 01:37:19.691
This is home.

01:37:19.798 --> 01:37:22.665
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.

01:37:22.768 --> 01:37:24.599
You still owe me that first date.

01:37:24.736 --> 01:37:27.705
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

01:37:27.806 --> 01:37:30.001
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

01:37:31.376 --> 01:37:34.106
Actually, there is one thing.

01:37:34.646 --> 01:37:36.944
Whoo-hoo!

01:37:37.049 --> 01:37:38.983
Whoo! I'll be doggone!

01:37:43.789 --> 01:37:45.188
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.750
Thanks, Mater!

01:37:57.269 --> 01:37:59.237
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:02.837
Impossible!

01:38:03.408 --> 01:38:04.841
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!

01:38:04.977 --> 01:38:07.537
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.

01:38:07.646 --> 01:38:09.739
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!

01:38:09.848 --> 01:38:11.782
Not if I see you first!

01:38:11.884 --> 01:38:13.852
Yippee!
