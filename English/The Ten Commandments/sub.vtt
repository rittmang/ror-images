WEBVTT

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:01.464
Ladies and gentlemen, young and old,

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.967
this may seem an unusual procedure,

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.174
speaking to you
before the picture begins,

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:10.806
but we have an unusual subject:

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.717
the story of the birth of freedom.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.227
The story of Moses.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.604
As many of you know,

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:23.065
the Holy Bible omits
some 30 years of Moses' life,

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.480
from the time he was
a three-month-old baby

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:30.026
and was found in the bulrushes
by Bithiah,

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:31.785
the daughter of Pharaoh,

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.412
and adopted into the court of Egypt

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.292
until he learned that he was Hebrew

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.078
and killed the Egyptian.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.417
To fill in those missing years,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.459
we turned to ancient historians

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.549
such as Philo and Josephus.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.433
Philo wrote at the time that
Jesus of Nazareth walked the Earth,

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.141
and Josephus wrote some 50 years later

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.900
and watched the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Romans.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:06.107
These historians had access
to documents

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.819
long since destroyed,
or perhaps lost,

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.609
like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.036
The theme of this picture

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.950
is whether men are
to be ruled by God's law,

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:23.838
or whether they are to be ruled by
the whims of a dictator like Rameses.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.249
Are men the property of the state,

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:30.260
or are they free souls under God?

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.767
This same battle continues
throughout the world today.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:40.145
Our intention was not to create a story,

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:45.480
but to be worthy
of the divinely inspired story

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.987
created 3,000 years ago:

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.319
the five books of Moses.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.657
The story takes three hours
and 39 minutes to unfold.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.322
There will be an intermission.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.661
Thank you for your attention.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:26.632
And God said, "Let there be light. "

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.267
And there was light.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:35.683
And from this light,
God created life upon Earth.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.860
And man was given dominion

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.863
over all things upon this Earth,

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:47.119
and the power to choose
between good and evil,

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.951
but each sought to do his own will

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.617
because he knew not
the light of God's law.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.286
Man took dominion over man.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.048
The conquered
were made to serve the conqueror

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.961
The weak were made to serve the strong.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.848
And freedom was gone from the world.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:11.556
So did the Egyptians
cause the children of Israel

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.096
to serve with rigor;

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:18.233
and their lives were made bitter
with hard bondage,

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:23.022
and their cry came up unto God
and God heard them.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.236
And cast into Egypt,

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.948
into the lowly hut
of Amram and Yochabel,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.158
the seed of a man

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.495
upon whose mind and heart
would be written

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.661
God's law and God's commandments.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:42.549
One man to stand alone
against an empire.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.084
Divine One,

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.630
last night our astrologers
saw an evil star

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.846
- enter into the house of Egypt.
- Meaning war?

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:55.683
From the frontiers of Sinai and Libya
to the cataracts of the Nile.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.223
What nation would dare
draw the sword against us?

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.733
The enemy to fear
is in the heart of Egypt.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:01.859
What?

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.067
The Hebrew slaves
in the land of Goshen.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.860
I number my enemies by their swords,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.323
not by their chains, High Priest.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:14.956
Chains have been forged
into swords before now, Divine One.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.994
Among these slaves,
there is a prophecy of a deliverer

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.629
who will lead them out of bondage.
The star proclaims his birth.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.211
Then let the Hebrews die.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.502
Slaves are wealth, Commander.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.387
The more slaves we have,
the more bricks we make.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.892
I would still see fewer bricks made
and fewer Hebrews in Goshen.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.849
It is our eastern gate.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.810
Since this deliverer
is among their newborn,

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.943
only their newborn need die.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:50.409
Every newborn Hebrew man-child
shall die.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:54.322
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.036
So speaks Rameses I.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.458
No!

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.086
Oh, no!

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:14.262
Please! Please! No!

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.544
God of Abraham,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.463
take my child into thy hands,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.053
that he may live to thy service.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:08.236
But Mother,
we have not even given him a name.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.897
God will give him a name.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.043
Follow it, Miriam.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.330
Watch it from the reeds.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.755
- See where the Lord will lead him.
- Yes, Mother.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.788
- Why didn't you say no?
- She didn't think of it.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.408
Here! Throw!

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.871
- You're getting fat.
- Too many sesame cakes!

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.333
Catch a lotus and you catch a wish.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.088
What will you wish for,
Tuya, gold or a man?

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.380
Gold, of course.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:21.677
- Then I could have any man!
- Gold will never fill an empty heart.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.892
Quiet, you chattering geese.

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.933
Memnet, you're only happy
when you're miserable.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:33.572
You fools! Talk of empty hearts
before the Pharaoh's daughter.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.405
What is there in her heart,
but the memory of a dead husband?

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:40.070
We meant no harm, Memnet.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.702
Look, there's something here!

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.792
Be sure it's not a crocodile!

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.083
Bithiah can charm tears
from a crocodile.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.613
What is it, Bithiah?
What did you End?

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.991
Only a drifting basket.

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:25.082
- Shall we come and help you get it?
- Memnet, send the girls away.

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.037
I'd rather be alone now.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.959
Now see what you've done.
Back to the palace, all of you.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:36.376
- Go on. All of you. Musicians, too.
- We wouldn't hurt Bithiah.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.466
Bithiah's tired of you and so am I.
Off you go.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.508
- You're tired of everything.
- Go on. Off you go.

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:47.929
Go on. Hurry up!
You've hurt her enough.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.531
- What have you found?
- The answer to my prayers.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:05.071
You prayed for a basket?

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:09.459
No. I prayed for a son.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.670
Your husband
is in the house of the dead.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.754
And he has asked the Nile god
to bring me this beautiful boy.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.224
Do you know the pattern
of this cloth?

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.977
If my son is covered in it...

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.192
...it is a royal robe.

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:38.855
Royal? It is the Levite cloth
of a Hebrew slave.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:41.194
This child was put upon the water

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.451
to save its life
from your father's edict.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:47.864
I am the Pharaoh's daughter,
and this is my son.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.207
He shall be reared in my house
as the Prince of the Two Lands.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.253
My mother and her mother before her

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.589
were branded to the Pharaoh's service.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:04.176
I will not see you make this son
of slaves a prince of Egypt.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.761
You will see it, Memnet.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:10.224
You will see him walk
with his head among the eagles.

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:14.357
And you will serve him as you serve me.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:19.021
Fill the ark with water.
Sink it into silence.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.846
Raise your hands, Memnet.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.931
What you have buried in the Nile
shall remain buried in your heart.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.643
- Swear it.
- I will be silent.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:58.776
The day you break that oath will be
the last your eyes shall ever see.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:09.617
You will be the glory of Egypt, my son.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.703
Mighty in words and deeds.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.334
Kings shall bow before you.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:19.373
Your name will live
when the pyramids are dust.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.416
And...

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:27.006
...because I drew you from the water,
you shall be called Moses.

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.471
Moses! Moses!

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:31.976
Moses...

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:51.071
He proclaims his coming from afar,
does he not, my son?

00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:56.083
Such favor with the people
can be dangerous, Great Sethi.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.621
To whom, Rameses? To me or to you?

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:05.169
It would not be the first time that fame
has turned a prince against his Pharaoh.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:08.383
Or that envy has turned a brother
against his brother.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.889
Envy is for the weak.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:12.425
And beauty is for the strong.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.594
That is what you have in mind.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.810
If you mean Nefretiri, yes, my father.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.734
Is it the princess'
beauty that attracts you, Rameses,

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:26.363
or the fact that she must marry the man
I choose to follow me on the throne?

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:30.152
I am the son of your body.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.195
Who else could be your heir?

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:36.457
The man best able to rule Egypt
will follow me.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.796
I owe that to my fathers,
not to my sons.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.959
- Then I shall follow you.
- Shall you?

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.755
Do not let ambition
shave your prince's lock.

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:54.175
I sent Moses to destroy a city.
He returns in triumph.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.765
I sent you to build a city.

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.305
Where is it?

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.600
It will rise when I have put fear

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.861
into the stiff-necked
Hebrew slaves who build it.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.693
But this I know, my father:

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:14.745
no pretended brother

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.123
will ever have your crown...

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.167
...or Nefretiri.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.454
Indeed?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.749
Whoever I choose shall have my crown...

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.052
...and Nefretiri.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.437
I think I see him, Memnet.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.312
Moses...

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:48.191
Yes, I can see him!

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:52.450
Moses!

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.119
Listen, Memnet. Listen.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:07.131
The trumpets tell all the world
he's come back to me.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.916
Hear them.

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:13.296
And all those shouts are drowned
by the beating of my heart.

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.464
- Moses!
- Do you hear, Memnet?

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:20.808
- The whole city calls his name.
- I hear them, Nefretiri.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.808
The Lord Moses, Prince of Egypt,

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:28.103
son of the Pharaoh's sister,

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:33.025
beloved of the Nile god,
commander of the Southern Host.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.915
Welcome home!

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.668
- Prince Moses!
- The blessings of the god Amun-Ra

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:51.004
be upon you, Great Prince.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.670
He has brought down
the pride of Ethiopia.

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.840
- Yes, that is...
- The old windbag.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.969
- I agree with him.
- May your name be exalted on Earth,

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:06.187
o' conqueror, even as the sun
is exalted in the heavens.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:14.904
Welcome to my sister's son.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.443
We have heard how you took
ibis from the Nile

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.454
to destroy the venomous serpents
used against you

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.957
when you laid siege
to the city of Saba.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:26.915
May my arms stay strong
in your service, Great Sethi.

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:34.837
Who is this fair young god
come into the house of Pharaoh?

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:38.973
No need to tell you
how I share her joy at your return-

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.384
No need, my brother.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.430
Great one, I bring you Ethiopia!

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.531
Command them to kneel before Pharaoh.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:02.037
Command what you have conquered,
my brother.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:06.584
I bring the Ethiopian king
and his sister in friendship,

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:09.370
as an ally to guard our southern gates.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:15.419
My son has dealt wisely with you,
Ethiopia. Welcome as a friend.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:22.808
Great king, I will ask
but one favor of your friendship.

00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:27.889
This green stone from our mountains,

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:31.559
that I may give it to your
Prince of Egypt,

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:35.821
for he is kind, as well as wise.

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:40.944
It is pleasing to the gods to see
a man honored by his enemies.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.989
And such a beautiful enemy!

00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:47.791
See to their comfort.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:02.549
Divine One, here is the full count
of Ethiopia's tribute.

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.138
Bearers!

00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:40.637
I am sending down the Nile 20 full
barges of such wealth as you see here.

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:43.798
Logs of ebony and trees of myrrh,

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:46.058
all for your new treasure city.

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:49.846
A handsome tribute indeed, Moses.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:52.561
Unfortunately,
I have no new treasure city.

00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:54.851
And you will have none.

00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:57.190
The stiff-necked slaves
die more willingly

00:23:57.353 --> 00:24:01.358
-than bend their backs in your service.
- Why?

00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:04.902
They believe a deliverer has come
to lead them from their bondage.

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:07.913
Deliverer? Deliverer?!

00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:11.576
He has been foretold by every falling
star since my father's time.

00:24:11.742 --> 00:24:14.370
Now, you make him an excuse
for your failure to build my city.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:16.914
I am not one to make excuses-

00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:21.085
If you doubt me,

00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:23.253
let Moses build a city.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.718
No! No.

00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:28.760
He's just trying
to keep Moses away from you, Sethi.

00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:30.803
Or you, perhaps.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.691
I think our roosters would crow
more softly on another roof.

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.186
Stand before me, both of you.

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.073
Would you please your Pharaoh, Moses?

00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:51.116
- Your wish is my will.
- Then you build my city.

00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:54.080
A wise decision.

00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.665
A noble task.

00:24:55.828 --> 00:25:00.459
Rameses, do you believe
this slave deliverer is a myth?

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:03.218
What I believe is of no account.

00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:06.301
What matters is
the slaves believe in him.

00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:08.636
Of course, of course.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.474
Then you, too, shall go to Goshen-

00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:15.480
Learn if this deliverer
be a myth or a man.

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:19.485
If a myth, bring him to me in a bottle.
If a man,

00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:22.112
bring him to me in chains.

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:27.402
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.390
Your fragrance
is like the wine of Babylon.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.691
I could...

00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:03.695
But you are the throne princess,

00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:07.700
and by the Pharaoh's law,
you can marry only a Pharaoh.

00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:11.161
I shall marry a Pharaoh...

00:26:12.613 --> 00:26:14.536
...you.

00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:16.621
Rameses might not agree
with that idea.

00:26:16.784 --> 00:26:17.876
But Sethi might.

00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:20.333
While you were gone,
I kept your name on his lips,

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:23.500
your praises in his ears.
But now, unless you can succeed,

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:25.383
you'll be the prince
of some desert province

00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:28.386
and I'll be Rameses' wife. Oh, Moses!

00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:32.721
Build a city for him,
and Sethi will deny you nothing.

00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:35.557
I will build the city for love of Sethi,

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:37.813
not for the throne of Egypt.

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.224
But I am Egypt.

00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:48.240
Now, the flame you lighted
burns close to the throne.

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:51.903
Your tongue would dig
your grave, Memnet.

00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:57.916
A conqueror already conquered?

00:26:58.075 --> 00:27:02.171
The first face I looked for
and the last I find. Mother.

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:05.424
I was thanking the gods
for your safe return.

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:12.506
But I find you in grave danger here.

00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:16.434
In intoxicating danger, Mother.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:20.598
Marry her if you can, my son,
but never fall in love with her.

00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:24.234
I'll be less trouble to him
than the Hebrew slaves of Goshen.

00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:26.145
Goshen?

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:05.860
You've guzzled enough.
Bring those bricks up and get on.

00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:08.987
You, there's other swine to water.

00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:10.819
Water girl! Water!

00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:12.983
Get those bricks back on.

00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:16.412
Here! Water lily!

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.072
My name is Lilia.

00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:21.663
To me you are a lily,
and I want water.

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:32.677
Joshua...

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:36.511
Joshua, I thought
you'd never come down.

00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:39.176
Water before love, my girl.

00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:46.688
Does it take the whole Nile
to quench your thirst?

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.603
No, just your lips.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.491
Be careful, my love.
Dathan's eyes can see through stone.

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:57.529
Dathan is a vulture feeding
on the flesh of his own people.

00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:01.073
When he looks at me, I'm afraid.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.493
If he touches you,
I'll strangle him with his own whip.

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:06.378
And bring death to 1,000 others?

00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:10.006
Is life in bondage better than death?

00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:16.096
Joshua, we must have hope.

00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:18.724
God will send us the deliverer.

00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:23.353
Hope? On the heels
of every hope walks Dathan.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.584
You're Dathan, the Hebrew overseer.

00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:59.177
Chief Hebrew overseer, mighty one.

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:03.845
Baka, the master builder,
has told me that I can rely on you.

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:07.356
I am warmed by his favor.

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.943
Rely on you to sell
your own mother for a price.

00:30:13.437 --> 00:30:17.283
And who am I to deny the word
of the master builder?

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:22.571
Where is this would-be deliverer
who would set the Hebrews free?

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.908
Who can say, immortal prince?

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:28.076
They do not confide in me.

00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:33.416
- But it is possible to learn.
- No doubt.

00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.506
You have rat's ears and a ferret's nose.

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:40.263
To use in your service, son of Pharaoh.

00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:44.472
Add to them the eyes of a weasel
and find me this deliverer.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.788
Lean your backs into it!

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.174
Old woman! Old woman!

00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:21.839
More grease under the center stone.

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:45.446
- Yochabel!
- Help me!

00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:48.289
Stop the stone!

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:53.211
Keep pulling up there.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.544
Yochabel is caught. Stop the stone!

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.882
Come on, pull!

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:08.718
Pull!

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.721
Pull!

00:32:17.394 --> 00:32:21.149
- Pull!
- You'll kill her! Stop the stone!

00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:24.193
We don't stop a moving block
for an old woman.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:27.408
Lay on the lash! Keep it moving!

00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:32.038
Stop the stone! Stop the stone!

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:46.761
Hold the ropes!

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:55.182
Water! Water!

00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:01.775
- Cut the old woman loose.
- She'll stay where she is,

00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:03.440
and you'll die in the lion pits.

00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:07.828
- Joshua!
- Run to the prince and beg mercy.

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:09.909
- Mercy from Rameses?!
- No, no.

00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:12.790
The Prince Moses,
there on the pavilion.

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.463
- After her! After her!
- Hold him!

00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:21.838
Stop her!

00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:26.004
Stop that girl!

00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:29.845
The water girl, stop her!

00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:33.937
Stop that girl! Stop her!

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:37.315
Mercy, Prince Moses!

00:33:37.474 --> 00:33:39.818
- Mercy, Prince Moses!
- Come here.

00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:48.073
- Mercy? What have you done?
- Not for myself, Lord Prince.

00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:52.331
For a slave who saved old Yochabel
and me from death

00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:54.742
between the granite blocks.

00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:58.162
A delicate flower
to be pressed between walls of stone.

00:33:58.328 --> 00:33:59.329
How were you saved?

00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.169
A stonecutter struck the overseer.

00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:04.710
There can be only one punishment
for the stonecutter.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:08.597
Blood makes poor mortar. Come.

00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:15.395
Prince Moses!

00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:25.654
Get away, you!

00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:29.034
Would you bury the old woman alive
in a tomb of rock?

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.911
My noble one, it caught.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.546
I had not the strength to free myself.

00:34:41.705 --> 00:34:44.754
Your shoulder should not
bear a burden, old woman.

00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:50.138
The Lord has renewed my strength
and lightened my burdens.

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:55.226
He would have done better
to remove them.

00:34:57.053 --> 00:35:01.149
They use the old ones to do the work
of greasing the stones, Lord Prince.

00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:03.561
If they are killed, it is no loss.

00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:07.027
Are you a master builder
or a master butcher?

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:10.488
If we stopped moving stones
for every grease woman who falls,

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.323
the city would never rise.

00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:14.863
If the slaves are not driven
they will not work.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.374
If their work lags,
it is because they are not fed.

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:18.749
You seem strong enough.

00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:22.208
I am a stonecutter.
The Pharaohs like their images cut deep.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.622
Hold your whip!

00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:31.346
You know it is death
to strike an Egyptian?

00:35:31.504 --> 00:35:33.427
I know it.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.311
- Yet you struck him? Why?
- To save the old woman.

00:35:38.053 --> 00:35:40.897
- What is she to you?
- An old woman.

00:35:41.056 --> 00:35:43.229
Lord Prince, send him to his death.

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:45.268
The man has courage.

00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:47.403
You do not speak like a slave.

00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:50.532
God made men.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.115
- Men made slaves.
- Which god?

00:35:54.277 --> 00:35:57.281
The God of Abraham, the Almighty God.

00:35:57.447 --> 00:36:01.452
If your god is almighty,
why does he leave you in bondage?

00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:04.963
He will choose the hour
of our freedom

00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.964
and the man who will deliver us.

00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:11.503
- Lord Prince, this man speaks treason.
- It is not treason to want freedom.

00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.764
Release him.

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.769
Difficulty with the slaves, my brother?

00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:31.486
None that could not be cured by
a ration of grain and a day of rest.

00:36:32.482 --> 00:36:34.155
A day of rest?

00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.695
When your horses tire, they're rested.

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.829
When they hunger, they're fed.

00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:44.165
Slaves draw stone and brick.
My horses draw the next Pharaoh.

00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:46.671
Is there any grain
stored here in Goshen?

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.674
None that you would
dare take, my brother.

00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:52.211
The temple granaries are full.

00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.514
Bring the push-pole men
and some women with baskets.

00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:59.847
I will... great prince.

00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:04.098
I warn you, Moses,
the temple grain belongs to the gods.

00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:08.440
What the gods can digest will
not sour in the belly of a slave.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.738
- Push-pole men!
- You, back where you belong!

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.867
I have the prince's orders.
One and two poles, up!

00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:19.450
- Bring 100 women with baskets.
- Elisheba, bring your basket.

00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.250
Push-polers, follow me.

00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:34.677
Out of the way!

00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:36.804
Break open the bins.

00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:40.092
Out of the way. Stand back.

00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:21.758
Well, well.

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.020
Divine One.

00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:29.433
There!

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:32.944
My jackals have your hounds at bay-

00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:36.698
Dogs at bay are dangerous.

00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:39.735
When they walk upright
and feed on temple grain.

00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:43.531
Of course. You've been bringing
petitions against Moses for months.

00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:46.245
Well, the city's being built
and I'm winning this game,

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:48.205
so don't interrupt us with trifles.

00:38:48.368 --> 00:38:52.623
Before your city is finished,
these trifles will surprise you.

00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:55.042
Life is full of surprises.

00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:00.846
And today I have one for you, my kitten.

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:04.263
Moses!

00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:07.144
And Rameses.

00:39:07.303 --> 00:39:09.726
You crocodile!

00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:17.485
Triples. You've lost.
I'll never let you win again.

00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:23.029
You thought that by losing to me
you would win for Moses.

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:27.199
Well, you know, crowns are sometimes
lost by smiles and dimples.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:30.244
- And so is patience.
- Yours?

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.504
Are the plans for my jubilee complete?

00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:37.168
All but your proclamation for the
marriage of Prince Rameses to Nefretiri.

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:38.676
No.

00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:41.258
Are you quite sure it will be Rameses?

00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.674
Who else could be your successor?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.968
Moses, of course.

00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:49.980
Because of Moses there is no wheat
in the temple granaries.

00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:54.518
You don't look any leaner. You're both
very generous with your advice.

00:39:54.684 --> 00:39:55.936
Will you take mine?

00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:58.275
No, I will choose my own successor-

00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.963
Did you lose your head, my sweet?

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:21.423
I sent you to Goshen
to bring me the head of the jackal

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:24.840
who would free the slaves.
Where is it?

00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:27.759
The slaves do not need a deliverer now.

00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:31.226
- They have Moses.
- Is that a riddle?

00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:35.563
He gives them the priests' grain
and one day in seven to rest.

00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:39.195
They call it the day of Moses.

00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:43.575
- This man makes himself a god.
- I prefer him as a man.

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:46.077
You would prefer him as Pharaoh.

00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:49.364
- Are you afraid of Moses?
- Yes.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.749
'Cause now he holds Ethiopia
in his left hand,

00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:55.162
Goshen in his right, and you,
my Pharaoh, are in between them.

00:40:55.328 --> 00:40:58.958
Do you imply that he
would raise the slaves against me?

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:02.844
- I've been his father.
- Ambition knows no father.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:06.302
Moses could no more betray you
than I could, Sethi.

00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:09.680
He can tell me that when he arrives.

00:41:09.842 --> 00:41:14.473
- He will not be here, my father.
- What?

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:16.770
I sent for both of you.

00:41:16.933 --> 00:41:20.904
His word is that he cannot attend you,
being pressed by...

00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:22.905
...other matters.

00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:27.114
Did you hear that? Other matters?

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.624
My escort.

00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:39.084
I will ride with you, my son,

00:41:39.247 --> 00:41:43.297
to see what rears itself in Goshen,
a city or treason.

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:51.051
You lying adder! You'll destroy
yourself with your own venom

00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:53.015
if you try to turn Sethi against Moses.

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:56.021
You would turn Sethi against me.

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:04.322
Remember, my sweet, that you must
be wife to the next Pharaoh,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.484
that you're going to be mine,
all mine,

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.368
like my dog or my horse or my falcon.

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:13.873
Only I will love you more,
and trust you less.

00:42:15.158 --> 00:42:18.662
You will never do the things to me
you would have done to Moses.

00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:42.732
I know you, my sweet.

00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:47.194
You're a sharp-clawed,
treacherous little peacock.

00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:51.365
But you're food for the gods,

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:54.030
and I'm going to have all of you.

00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:56.541
None of me.

00:42:56.699 --> 00:43:00.420
Did you think my kiss
was a promise of what you'll have?

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:03.172
No, my pompous one,

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:06.505
it was to let you know
what you will not have.

00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:10.096
I could never love you.

00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:13.265
Does that matter?

00:43:15.218 --> 00:43:17.186
You will be my wife.

00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:21.316
You will come to me whenever I call you.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.815
And I will enjoy that very much.

00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:29.065
Whether you enjoy it or not
is your own affair.

00:43:31.234 --> 00:43:33.532
But I think you will.

00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:52.589
That drop puts too much strain
on the stone. We need more sand.

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:56.847
I'm going to risk it, Baka.

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.387
There's little time
till the day of jubilee.

00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:02.558
If the stone cracks,
you may crack with it.

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:04.976
Ready blue signal.

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:06.816
Blue pennant.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.817
Blue pennant!

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.244
- The snubber is ready.
- Green pennant.

00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:32.344
Mallet men, ready!

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:36.508
Mallet men, ready, stand by!

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.426
Clear the main hawser!

00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:40.516
Mallet men ready.

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:52.152
You are not pleased to see me here.

00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:56.161
I am, Great Pharaoh, but now
I have important things to do.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.287
Red pennant, stand by.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.909
So Rameses tells me.

00:45:02.074 --> 00:45:04.793
More important things
than obeying my orders?

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:08.126
You ordered me to finish this city-
The strain in that stone is too great-

00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:10.667
We cannot wait. Red pennant.

00:45:13.502 --> 00:45:16.972
Red pennant... strike!

00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:28.769
- The stone will break.
- There are 2,000 slaves on the ropes.

00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.850
There is the obelisk of your jubilee.

00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:03.727
Baka, put 1,000 slaves
to removing the sand

00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:06.309
until the stone settles to its base.

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:14.526
- Pharaoh is pleased?
- With the obelisk, yes,

00:46:14.689 --> 00:46:18.068
but not with certain accusations
made against you.

00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:20.111
By whom?

00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:23.452
- You raided the temple granaries?
- Yes.

00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:29.037
- You gave the grain to the slaves?
- Yes.

00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:32.423
You gave them one day in seven to rest.

00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:34.174
Yes-

00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:39.635
Did you do all of this
to gain their favor?

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:43.768
A city is built of brick, Pharaoh.

00:46:43.926 --> 00:46:46.645
The strong make many.
The starving make few.

00:46:49.557 --> 00:46:52.527
The dead make none.

00:46:52.685 --> 00:46:55.063
So much for accusations.

00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:57.357
Now, judge the results.

00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:07.826
The pylons commemorate your victory
at Kadesh,

00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:10.370
where you broke the Amorites.

00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:15.463
- Are there any higher in Egypt?
- There are none higher in the world.

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:21.343
With so many slaves,
you could build... an army.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.303
But I have built a city.

00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:27.312
Sixteen of these lions of Pharaoh
will guard its gates.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.019
And it shall be the city
of Sethi's glory.

00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:36.024
Are these slaves loyal
to Sethi's glory,

00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:38.110
or to you, Moses?

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.067
The slaves worship their god...

00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:44.321
...and I serve only you.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:59.381
Let your own image proclaim
my loyalty for a thousand years.

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.431
Superb!

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:07.181
Rameses.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.525
And this you call treason?

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:18.984
Who would take a throne by force
that he has earned by deeds?

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:23.192
With this and Ethiopia,

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:27.409
your name shall be carved
beside mine on every pylon.

00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:30.955
Yours, Rameses, will be nowhere.

00:48:31.117 --> 00:48:35.668
In my judgment book, you have
accused your brother falsely.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:36.797
Come.

00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:39.584
Great Pharaoh,
he is the son of your body.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.220
I need no help, Moses,
to hold what is mine.

00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.554
I decide what is yours.

00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:50.014
Come with me, Moses.

00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:03.950
Will you lose the throne
because Moses builds a city?

00:49:06.402 --> 00:49:09.872
The city that he builds
shall bear my name.

00:49:11.073 --> 00:49:15.624
The woman that he loves
shall bear my child.

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:18.923
So it shall be written.

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:21.300
So it shall be done.

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:40.107
Yes. This is for the temple ceremony.

00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:42.856
This...

00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:50.408
This...

00:49:53.032 --> 00:49:55.581
...is for my wedding night.

00:49:56.368 --> 00:49:58.462
You will never wear it.

00:50:00.289 --> 00:50:02.132
Why not?

00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:07.718
I have brought you a cloth
more revealing. Send them away.

00:50:08.797 --> 00:50:13.223
Go, then, while I hear what this
puckered old persimmon has to say.

00:50:17.389 --> 00:50:22.395
Well? What croakings
of doom have you today?

00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:25.155
You prepare for a marriage
that will never be.

00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:27.658
You've been drinking honey wine!

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:32.579
I shall not let the Pharaoh
and Rameses be betrayed.

00:50:32.738 --> 00:50:37.335
Why should a slave care
which Pharaoh rules?

00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.746
For 30 years, I have been silent.

00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:43.837
Now, all the kings of Egypt
cry out to me from their tombs,

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:47.424
"Let no Hebrew sit upon our throne."

00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:52.174
What are you saying?

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:54.844
Rameses has the blood of many kings.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.514
- And Moses?
- He is lower than the dust.

00:50:58.681 --> 00:51:03.187
Not one drop of royal blood
flows through his veins.

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:06.026
He is the son of Hebrew slaves.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:11.660
I'll have you torn into so many pieces,

00:51:11.819 --> 00:51:14.572
even the vultures won't find them.

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.615
Who hatched this lie? Rameses?

00:51:16.782 --> 00:51:19.535
Rameses does not know... yet.

00:51:22.121 --> 00:51:23.919
You will repeat this to Bithiah!

00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.709
It was Bithiah who drew a slave child
from the Nile,

00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.253
called him son and Prince of Egypt,

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.343
blinding herself to the truth

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:34.634
and the pain of an empty womb.

00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:37.511
Were you alone with Bithiah?

00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:41.399
A little girl led me
to the Hebrew woman Yochabel,

00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:44.902
that the child might
be suckled by his true mother.

00:51:46.353 --> 00:51:48.731
Take care, old frog.

00:51:49.732 --> 00:51:52.485
You croak too much against Moses.

00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:56.246
Would you mingle the blood
of slaves with your own?

00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:59.784
He will be my husband.
I shall have no other.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.580
Then use this to wrap your first-born.

00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:07.216
Torn from a Levite's robe.

00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:09.718
It was Moses' swaddling cloth.

00:52:13.339 --> 00:52:15.842
And your shroud!

00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:20.888
You think I care whose son he is?

00:52:21.055 --> 00:52:24.559
- Rameses cares.
- You won't live to tell him.

00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:43.539
Nefretiri?

00:52:44.453 --> 00:52:49.710
Nefretiri! Have you closed your doors
to make a beggar of a prince?

00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:58.635
I'm the beggar, Moses, begging you
to hold me in your arms. Kiss me.

00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:00.474
Just kiss me.

00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:07.309
You're no beggar, my love.

00:53:07.476 --> 00:53:11.322
You're a conqueror,
and I am your captive for life.

00:53:11.814 --> 00:53:16.069
One lifetime will not be half enough.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.159
You will be King of Egypt.

00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:23.493
And I will be your footstool.

00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:26.629
A man stupid enough
to use you for a footstool

00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:29.165
would not be wise enough to rule Egypt.

00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:30.708
Princess!

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:34.469
Princess, the raven has dropped
a black feather at your door.

00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:38.098
- Who can...?
- No, Moses, leave the world outside.

00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:40.760
Pardon, pardon, royal one.

00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:44.055
- The old nurse, Memnet...
- Go away.

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.600
- I don't want to hear anything.
- What about Memnet?

00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:51.270
She's dead. She must
have fallen from the balcony.

00:53:51.437 --> 00:53:55.317
I will not hear unhappy things tonight.
Go away!

00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:02.494
Old Memnet must have walked
that balcony a thousand times.

00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:05.409
What is the death of one slave to us?

00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:08.204
She was a faithful servant to you.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:12.466
Can one so rich in love
be so poor in pity?

00:54:12.624 --> 00:54:15.969
What kind of a woman
holds me captive?

00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:19.507
One who loves you
and will not lose you.

00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:24.053
One who will be your wife. Nothing in
the world can change that. Nothing.

00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:28.065
Neither Rameses' princely plots
nor Memnet's evil lies.

00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.567
You've heard Memnet grumbling
all your life.

00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:33.696
Why should it upset you now?

00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:36.778
Because she grumbled against you.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.739
Oh, let her threats be buried with her.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.575
Look, the night's a crown of stars,

00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:48.085
and the darkness a robe
of forgetfulness.

00:54:48.243 --> 00:54:51.747
Come, love. Let's share them.
We'll use the moon for a scepter.

00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:56.510
- A piece of Hebrew cloth!
- Memnet may have dropped it.

00:54:56.668 --> 00:55:00.093
Memnet was not Hebrew.
Why would she bring this here?

00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:03.384
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

00:55:04.218 --> 00:55:07.597
- Tell me.
- She was taking it to Rameses...

00:55:09.097 --> 00:55:11.350
- ...to destroy you.
- To de...?

00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:14.566
How could Rameses destroy me
with a piece of cloth?

00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:19.734
Moses, Moses, why do you question
me? Why do you care? Yes!

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.994
I killed her.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:25.747
What does it matter?
A hundred slaves die every day.

00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:28.625
- What's done is forgotten.
- It is not forgotten.

00:55:28.784 --> 00:55:31.128
What is this cloth
to do with me? Tell me.

00:55:31.286 --> 00:55:33.209
It will make no difference between us?

00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:36.879
How could it make a difference?

00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:41.468
A child was wrapped in it.

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:45.430
- What child?
- Bithiah took him from the river.

00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.594
Memnet was with her.

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.476
Who was this child?

00:55:50.639 --> 00:55:54.985
Memnet is dead. No one need know
who you are. I love you.

00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:56.486
I killed for you.

00:55:56.645 --> 00:55:58.864
I'll kill anyone that comes between us.

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:01.070
Why did you kill for me, Nefretiri?

00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:04.703
If you love me, do not lie.
Who was the child?

00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:08.619
Hold me in your arms.

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:11.456
Hold me... close.

00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:17.751
You were not born
Prince of Egypt, Moses...

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.429
...but the son of Hebrew slaves.

00:56:29.094 --> 00:56:31.062
You believe that?

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.316
I'll believe anything
you want me to believe.

00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:37.944
Say you are not,
I'll believe you are not.

00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:42.654
Love cannot drown truth, Nefretiri.

00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:49.661
You do believe it,
or you would not have killed Memnet.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:56.297
I love you.
That's the only truth I know.

00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:03.386
Did this child of the Nile
have a mother?

00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:10.770
Memnet called her Yochabel.

00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:15.061
I will ask Bithiah.

00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:22.031
How could you doubt me?

00:57:22.189 --> 00:57:26.535
You did not doubt me when I held you
as you took your first step.

00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:29.913
It's a wicked lie spun by Rameses.

00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:32.746
Mother, did Rameses spin this?

00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:38.418
The word of your mother against
a piece of cloth found by Memnet?

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.207
How did you know it was Memnet?

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:44.925
Who else? Memnet nursed Rameses.

00:57:45.087 --> 00:57:47.761
She shall pay for spreading his lies.

00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:51.097
- She has paid.
- She's dead?

00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:53.432
At the hand of Nefretiri.

00:57:59.434 --> 00:58:04.531
Put away any fears or suspicions
that may remain with you, my son.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.443
Why, your will will be law in Egypt
when you are crowned

00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:09.907
and sceptered as her king.

00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:21.715
Memnet spoke of a Hebrew woman
named Yochabel.

00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:24.001
Did you ever know her?

00:58:27.796 --> 00:58:29.548
No.

00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:44.238
Yours was the face
I saw above my cradle,

00:58:44.396 --> 00:58:46.899
the only mother I've ever known.

00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:53.322
Wherever I am led
or whatever I must do,

00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:56.162
I will always love you.

00:59:20.015 --> 00:59:23.019
My chariot. I will drive to Goshen.

00:59:32.694 --> 00:59:35.197
A chariot here in Goshen?

00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:53.800
- You know who I am?
- It has been many years, great one.

00:59:55.008 --> 00:59:58.729
- Who are they?
- All that remain of my children.

00:59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.935
I will speak to you alone.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:09.360
Why have you...?

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:18.574
- Why have you come here?
- Because Moses will come here.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.040
- My son?
- No, my son.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.421
And that's all that he must know.

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:27.753
My lips might deny him, great one,

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.759
but my eyes never could.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:33.422
You shall leave Goshen,
you and your family, tonight.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.307
We are Levites,
appointed shepherds of Israel.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.934
We cannot leave our people.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.393
Would you take from Moses
all that I have given him?

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.604
Would you undo all
that I have done for him?

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:47.690
I have put the throne of Egypt
within his reach.

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:51.949
- What can you give him in its place?
- I gave him life.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:56.704
I gave him love!
Was it your hand that dried his tears?

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:59.285
And when he was troubled,
was it your heart that ached for him?

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.666
Yes-

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:05.125
My heart ached for him.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:08.837
And my arms ached to hold him,

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:13.004
but I dared not even touch
the hem of his garment.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.054
His heritage from me
could only have been misery,

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:21.891
poverty and the lash.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:27.359
No, I will not take from him the
glory and riches you have given him.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:33.111
For this you shall be well cared for.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.568
You and your family shall be taken
from Goshen tonight.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:41.081
No matter where you send me,

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:45.164
if the God of Abraham
has a purpose for my son,

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:49.332
he will come to know it and fulfill it.

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:54.089
Come, gather your things, quickly.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.596
Quickly.
I shall see you want for nothing.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.554
You and your children
shall be given freedom.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:04.096
Has my mother forgotten?
Only the Pharaoh can free a slave.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.983
Moses! Do not enter.
There is only sorrow here.

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:10.439
Are you comforting it, my mother?

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:14.152
I followed you here
to find this woman, Yochabel...

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.543
You were the woman
who was caught between the stones.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:29.671
- Until you came.
- My son, if you love me...

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:33.675
I love you, my mother,
but am I your son?

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.300
Or yours?

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.592
No, you are not my son.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:49.142
If you believe that men and women
are cattle to be driven under the lash,

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:52.732
if you can bow before idols of stone

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:56.148
and golden images of beasts...

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:59.155
...you are not my son.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:06.538
My son would be a slave.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.462
His hands would be gnarled

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.794
and broken from the brick pits,

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:18.383
his back scarred
from the taskmaster's whip,

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:22.300
but in his heart would burn
the spirit of the living God.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.560
Does this god demand
a scarred back and broken hands

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.266
as the price of his favor?

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.399
This desert god
is the hope of the hopeless.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.855
Your place is in the palace halls.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.771
You have mounted
to the sun on golden wings.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:40.613
You belong to me, to Nefretiri,
to Sethi, to all those who love you.

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:43.494
Do they love less who have no hope?

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.916
Will you swear in the name of this god
that you are not my mother?

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.875
We do not even know his name.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:03.765
Then look into my eyes
and tell me you are not my mother.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:12.437
Oh, Moses, Moses! I cannot, I cannot.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.037
I am your brother Aaron.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:31.126
I am Miriam, your sister.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:43.672
- I am your brother Moses.
- No! Get ready to leave. Hurry!

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:46.512
They're going away, Moses.
The secret's going with them.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:48.722
No one need ever know
the shame I brought upon you.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.057
Shame?

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:57.644
What change is there in me?

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:03.200
Egyptian or Hebrew, I am still Moses.

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:08.868
These are the same hands,
the same arms,

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.580
the same face
that were mine a moment ago.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:17.999
A moment ago, you were her son,
the strength of Egypt.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:21.634
Now, you are mine, a slave of Egypt.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:25.047
You find no shame in this?

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:30.219
There is no shame in me. How can I
feel shame for the woman who bore me?

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:36.058
- Or the race that bred me?
- God of my fathers.

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:39.569
Moses, what will you do?

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:52.244
This is the binding tie...

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.539
...and here I will stay.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:58.672
- Moses...
- To find the meaning of what I am.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:06.013
Why a Hebrew, or any man,
must be a slave.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.767
Put back your things.
You are not leaving.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.187
Moses?

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:22.195
Has she done more for you than I?

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:28.618
Will the life she gave you be more
useful in the black pits of slavery?

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:35.709
Cannot justice and truth
be served better upon a throne

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:40.668
where all men may benefit
from your goodness

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.333
and strength?

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:53.514
I do not know
what power shapes my way,

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:57.306
but my feet are set upon a road
that I must follow.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:02.902
Forgive me, Bithiah.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:07.566
God of our fathers,

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:11.987
who has appointed
an end to the bondage of Israel,

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:17.205
blessed am I
among all mothers in the land,

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:22.749
for my eyes have beheld thy deliverer.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:34.013
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
that treadeth out the com,

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:37.179
making straw for the bricks of Egypt,

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:42.192
nor spare the arms that endlessly
winnow the grain in the wind

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.479
to separate the wheat from the chaff

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:50.196
wheat borne stolidly
on the backs of countless slaves

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:54.704
from the heavy-laden Nile boats
to the teeming shore.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:58.207
Endlessly they plod
beneath the sheaves of wheat

01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:00.744
and endlessly return for more.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:04.707
A golden harvest to the threshers,

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:07.967
a grain safe to feed the masters,

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.255
bitterness to feed the slaves,

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.391
and to feed the brick pits, straw,

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.177
carried on the bowed backs of women

01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:21.849
down into the never-ending valley
of toil and agony,

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.518
stretching mile after mile.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:27.984
An inferno of mud-soaked bodies,

01:08:28.146 --> 01:08:31.992
where the treaders' feet
churn clay and straw

01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.154
into the mixture
for the Pharaoh 's bricks.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.416
And everywhere the lash
of watchful taskmasters

01:08:39.574 --> 01:08:41.918
ready to sting the backs of the weary.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.123
Blades chopping straw.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.510
Mattocks chopping clay.

01:08:50.668 --> 01:08:54.218
A ceaseless cycle of unending drudgery.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.803
From the mixing feet of treaders

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.765
to the pouring hands of brick molders

01:08:59.927 --> 01:09:03.056
moves the constant stream of mud,

01:09:03.222 --> 01:09:06.442
the lowly seed of tall cities,

01:09:06.601 --> 01:09:10.026
day after day, year after year;

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.940
century after century.

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.783
Bondage without rest,

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.286
toil without reward.

01:09:17.445 --> 01:09:19.743
These are the children of misery,

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:23.786
the afflicted,
the hopeless, the oppressed.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:27.380
And he went out unto his brethren

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.916
and looked on their burdens.

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:32.051
Water girl!

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.762
Here, here's water.

01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:50.395
That's a hard dance you do, old man.

01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:53.906
We've been dancing it for 400 years...

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.243
...to grim music.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:10:00.622
And the only deliverer
that has come to us is death.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.247
Back to work, you braying mules.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:14.506
You're strange to the pits.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.763
Your back is unscarred.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:22.094
You bring a warm smile
with your cool water.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.888
My smile is for a stonecutter.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.183
- The water is for you.
- I thank you.

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.228
Your voice is not strange.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.147
- You are...?
- One of many who thirst.

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.156
You there!

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.192
Come here.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:41.154
That is Baka, the master builder.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.542
- Does he call me or you?
- You! Water girl! I'm thirsty.

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.921
He does not thirst for water.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:57.713
Beauty is but a curse to our women.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:06.977
- Water, noble one?
- No, wine... the wine of beauty.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:10.983
What beauty can my lord find
in these mud pits?

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:14.737
The lotus flower blooms
in the Nile's gray mud.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:17.240
Dathan, she will do well
as a house slave.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:20.072
Do not take me from my people!

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:24.072
There would be danger.

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.661
Danger from such lovely hands?

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:30.624
There are other hands,
strong enough to kill.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:33.672
Our mud flower has a thorn.

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:37.085
Oh, please, Lord Baka, I beg you.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.094
Tears..-

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:41.881
When you have been bathed
in scented water,

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:46.428
when your limbs have
been caressed by sweet oils

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:50.224
and your hair combed with sandalwood,

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:53.393
there will be no time for tears.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.733
She is not worthy of your magnificence.
Let my eyes...

01:11:56.896 --> 01:12:00.366
Your eyes had best find the deliverer,
Dathan, or you will have no eyes.

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.277
Bring the girl.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:10.956
May the hand of God strike him.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:15.965
Dance, you mud turtles, dance!

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:20.629
You rot our bodies,
steal hope from our souls.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:24.220
Must you also
shame and defile our women?

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.680
Dance, you squealing goat!

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:34.442
We are not animals, we are men,

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.898
made in the image of God.

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:39.484
This will change your image.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.325
Dance, you.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.037
Get that straw cutter.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:55.004
Leave him,
or you'll be murdered with him.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:58.086
I'll not leave a man
to die in the mud.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.940
Thank you, my son.

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:18.152
But death is better than bondage,

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.281
for my days are ended

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:24.693
and my prayer unanswered.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.408
What prayer, old man?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.870
That before death closed my eyes

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:33.876
I might behold the deliverer

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:38.916
who will lead all men to freedom.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:43.173
What deliverer could
break the power of Pharaoh?

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:48.058
You, mud-carriers,
throw this carrion to the vultures.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:50.889
You, take his place.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.474
And dance the straw
into the mud, you dogs.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:14.208
Clear a path there!
Clear a path!

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:18.588
Stand aside, you. Make way.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.003
Clear a path.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:24.339
Come on, get back. Out of the way!

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.049
Keep your eyes on the ground.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:44.322
I need another oarsman
for my barge, a strong slave.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.030
- Your word is our will, great lady.
- The large one there.

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:51.321
- You, come up here.
- No, not that one.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.411
The very dirty one there.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:59.670
Yes, that one.
He may serve my purpose.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.876
You!

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:04.717
You! Out of the pit!

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:11.799
Out of the way!

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:13.434
Back to work!

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.469
Clear a path!

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.306
Stand aside, you.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.101
Back to work!

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:23.815
Clear a path!

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.983
First friend of the Pharaoh,

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.778
keeper of the royal seal,

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.663
Prince of On, Prince of Memphis,

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.999
Prince of Thebes,

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:39.377
beloved of the Nile god,

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.004
conqueror of Ethiopia,

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:44.586
general of generals,

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:48.504
commander of the Egyptian Host...

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:51.047
...a man of mud!

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:56.602
Is that what you want? To be a slave?

01:15:57.261 --> 01:16:00.982
Then why aren't you kneeling
at the feet of a princess?

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:04.815
I'm afraid the mud pits have
stiffened my knees, royal one.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:08.530
Shall I call back the guards?

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:13.490
- Do you think they could bend them?
- Oh, Moses! Moses!

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:17.873
You stubborn, splendid, adorable fool.

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.465
I'm not kneeling to a princess.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:29.719
No. You are kneeling to a woman

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:33.882
who's been worried about you
day and night since you disappeared.

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:36.551
What is there in the mud
of these slave pits

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:41.188
-that could keep you from my arms?
- My people.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:44.692
They may be your people,
but do you have to wallow with them?

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.397
Smell like them?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.905
If they are stained,
it's with the mud of slavery.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:53.568
If they reek,
it's with the stench of injustice.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:57.705
If you want to help your people,
come back to the palace.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:03.085
And hide the truth from Sethi?
That I am Hebrew and a slave?

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.372
The truth would break his dear old heart

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:09.259
and send Bithiah into exile or death.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:12.260
Think of us and stop hearing
the cries of your people.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:15.593
Their god does not hear their cry.

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:19.886
Will Rameses hear it if he is Pharaoh?

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:23.647
No. He would grind them
into the clay they mold,

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.774
double their labors.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:31.489
What about me?
Think of me as his wife.

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:36.786
Do you want to see me
in Rameses' arms?

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:40.574
- No.
- Then come back with me.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:45.958
Oh, Moses! The gods have
fashioned you for greatness.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.341
The splendor of your name
will last beyond the pyramids.

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:52.968
When you are Pharaoh,
you can free your people,

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:56.301
worship whatever gods you please,

01:17:56.463 --> 01:18:00.468
so long as I can worship you.

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:16.697
I will come to you at the palace
on the day of Sethi's jubilee.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.953
Come with me now.

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.916
No, my love.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:28.671
First I have a call to make
on the master builder.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.815
No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.692
Not red with the sammur gown.

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:02.496
My eyes can best be used elsewhere,
Lord Baka.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:04.453
Before you go,

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:08.119
let them look upon
what you thought unworthy.

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:12.006
You would let beauty
such as this go unseen?

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:16.044
You would let such a flower
go ungathered?

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:19.714
Dathan, you can see only mud,

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.680
so pick up her muddy clothes and go.

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:25.515
Go, all of you.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:31.020
Did you know, my dear,
that this golden web

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:34.232
was spun from the beards of shellfish?

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:39.943
- Please let me go to my home.
- You are at home.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:43.158
Here, taste this.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.574
The blood of Thracian grapes,
the wine of love.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.243
No wine can change my love.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.957
Then your love shall be my wine.

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:57.718
There's fire in the chariot house!

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.341
The chariot house.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:04.509
Guards! Guards!
You women take water to the roof.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:07.770
Dathan, take charge. Guards, after him.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:10.981
Pull it out of the shed.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.767
Take it clear of the house.

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:20.074
No, no, your wings
must not be singed, my dove,

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.610
at least not by that fire.

01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:26.197
- Joshua!
- Run, Lilia, run! The way is clear.

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.741
The master builder will not follow.

01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:32.119
Neither will you, stonecutter.

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:46.016
Bind him between the columns.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.650
See that his arms
are tightly stretched.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:58.358
You will die on your feet, stonecutter.

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:08.534
He'll cut him to pieces.

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:11.534
Now, go after the girl!

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.794
- Don't come back without her.
- We'll find her.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:21.502
You foolish, stupid man!

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.349
I would have kept her
only a short while.

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:30.512
She would have returned to you,
shall we say, more worthy.

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:34.436
Now, to whom shall I return Lilia?

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:37.351
You will not be there, Joshua.

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:40.688
You've seen me drive my chariot.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.442
I can flick a fly from my horse's ear

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:47.782
without breaking
the rhythm of his stride.

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:50.573
You've seen me use my whip.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.750
You make no outcry, Joshua.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.085
But you will.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:02.377
You will cry for the mercy of death.

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:07.886
One day you will listen
to the cry of slaves.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:10.471
This is not that day, Joshua.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:22.397
You hold your tongue almost
as well as I hold my temper.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:26.238
It's a pity to kill
so strong a stonecutter.

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:31.364
- Death will bring death, Baka.
- Who are you?

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:34.500
One who asks
what right you have to kill a slave.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:37.286
The right of a master to kill you
or any slave.

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:42.959
- Then kill me, master butcher!
- Moses!

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:02.023
Why have you done this?

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:04.780
- Where is the girl, Lilia?
- Gone.

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:07.658
Why are you dressed as a slave?

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.779
Why does a prince of Egypt kill
the Pharaoh's master builder

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:13.447
to save a Hebrew?

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.039
I am Hebrew.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.168
God of Abraham.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.302
Four hundred years we've waited.

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:30.180
The Pharaoh's soldiers
won't wait so long.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:33.513
The Almighty has heard our cries
from bondage.

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:36.478
You are the chosen one.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:41.066
- I know nothing of your god.
- He knows you, Moses.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:45.856
He has brought you to us.
You cannot turn your back upon us.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:50.948
You will deliver us. The finger
of God points the way to you.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.665
- Where was his body found?
- Buried in the sand, royal one.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:05.003
This is Baka’s knife.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.293
But there was no wound on the body.

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:13.174
Baka was a powerful man. It would
take strong hands to break him.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.968
The slave, Joshua, is a stonecutter.

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:19.347
Go find me this Joshua.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:25.611
Joshua's strength didn't kill
the master builder.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:29.524
Now speaks the rat
that would be my ears.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:32.159
Too many ears tie a rat's tongue.

01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:38.040
Go. All of you.

01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:45.335
Well? Who killed him?

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:48.046
I am poor man, generous one.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.381
What I bring is worth much.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:53.388
I have paid you much
and you have brought me nothing.

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:58.474
Now I bring you the world...
true son of Pharaoh.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:03.232
You offer me the world when you
cannot even bring me the deliverer.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:08.024
Who killed Baka?

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:12.066
- The deliverer.
- Would you play at words with me?

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:14.735
No, lord prince.

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:18.326
This murderer has now fled
to some distant land?

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:21.082
No, lord prince.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:23.209
Name him!

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:26.167
One who made himself
a prince and judge over us.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.925
If he knew I were here, he would
kill me as he killed the Egyptian.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:34.088
I will hang you myself
if you tire me further.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:40.761
There are those who would pay much

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:42.895
for what my eyes have seen.

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:46.605
You haggle with me like a seller
of melons in the marketplace?

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:51.648
No, I will not haggle, great prince.
Here's your money.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:57.616
But for ten talents of fine gold,

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.827
I'll give you the wealth of Egypt.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.163
Give me my freedom
and I'll give you the scepter.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:05.794
Give me the water girl, Lilia,

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:08.296
and I'll give you the princess
of your heart's desire.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:12.676
Give me this house of Baka,
and I'll give you the throne.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:15.971
Give me all that I ask...

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:19.633
...or give me leave to go.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.849
I will give you more than leave to go.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.309
I will send you where you belong.

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:30.152
I belong in your service, glorious one.

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.147
Very well.

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:36.617
I will bargain with you.

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:42.615
If what you say pleases me,
I will give you your price, all of it.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.710
If not, I will give you the point of
this blade through your lying throat.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:50.168
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:53.629
The deliverer...

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.260
...is Moses.

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:02.810
Draw one more breath to tell me
why Moses or any other Egyptian

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:05.471
would deliver the Hebrews.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:08.641
Moses is not Egyptian.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.024
He's Hebrew.

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:13.153
The son of slaves.

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:27.455
I will pay your price.

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.214
Imagine poor Nefretiri,

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:35.216
not knowing in which bed
she will sleep.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:38.595
- I'd be happy in either.
- But where is Prince Moses?

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:40.631
No Moses, no jubilee.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:28:00.985
I am told, my tiger lily,
they're wagering against me.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.153
Two golden debens to one.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:06.656
Yes. I wagered five myself!

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:09.872
You'll lose your debens if Moses
keeps me waiting any longer.

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:14.461
I double the wager. I'll watch
for Moses, you watch the dance!

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:42.617
While you wait to honor Moses,

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:45.495
I will honor Sethi's jubilee...

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.120
...with a gift.

01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:52.369
Strange gift.

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:57.792
You said if the deliverer were a myth,

01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:02.259
-to bring him in a bottle.
- The bottle is empty.

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:06.099
Yes. It is empty
because he is not a myth.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:09.888
- You have found such a man?
- Yes, my father.

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:13.523
I have found him in the midst
of treachery and treason,

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:16.811
with the blood of your
master builder red upon his hands.

01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:20.488
Shall I summon him
to Pharaoh's justice?

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.194
Summon him!

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:32.371
- Bring the Hebrew in.
- Bring the Hebrew in.

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:40.834
Moses.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:12.874
Great Pharaoh...

01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:17.830
...I stand in the shadow
of your justice.

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:21.374
Whose work is this?

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.010
I warned you of his treason, my father.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:29.050
- Treason?
- Judge now if I spoke truly.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:33.562
The evil star foretold him
as the destroyer of Egypt

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.722
and deliverer of slaves.

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:40.565
It is not possible. A prince of Egypt?

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:43.480
He is not a prince of Egypt.

01:30:43.647 --> 01:30:46.901
He is not the son of your sister.

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:50.571
He is the son of Hebrew slaves.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:59.664
Speak... my son.

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:06.511
I am the son of Amram and Yochabel.

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:08.388
Hebrew slaves.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:21.981
My brother, it was I
who deceived you, not Moses.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.818
- He was only a child.
- Leave me.

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:28.404
I shall not see your face again.

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:44.458
Moses, come to me.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:57.721
I do not care who you are or what you
are or what they may say about you,

01:31:57.887 --> 01:32:02.358
but I want to hear from your own lips

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:05.145
that you are not a traitor,

01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:09.361
that you would not lead these people
in revolt against me.

01:32:11.818 --> 01:32:13.946
Tell me, Moses. I will believe you.

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:21.169
I am not this deliverer you fear.

01:32:21.327 --> 01:32:26.174
It would take more than a man
to lead the slaves from bondage.

01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:28.551
It would take a god.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:32.839
But if I could free them,

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:34.758
I would.

01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:40.355
What has turned you against me?

01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:44.522
From the time my sister brought you
to the court, I loved you,

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:47.654
reared you, set you before my own son,

01:32:47.812 --> 01:32:50.691
because I saw in you

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:53.906
a worth and a greatness

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:55.537
above other men.

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:59.040
No son could have
more love for you than I.

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:02.874
Then why are you forcing me
to destroy you?

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.589
What evil has done this to you?

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:12.387
The evil that men should turn their
brothers into beasts of burden,

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:17.684
to slave and suffer in dumb anguish,

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:22.268
to be stripped of spirit
and hope and faith,

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:25.604
only because they're
of another race,

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:28.395
another creed.

01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:30.689
If there is a God,

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:33.734
he did not mean this to be so.

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:42.917
What I have done,
I was compelled to do.

01:33:48.414 --> 01:33:49.961
So be it.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.420
What I do now,

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:56.089
I am compelled to do.

01:33:57.924 --> 01:34:01.269
No! No!

01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:09.356
Rameses,

01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:11.942
Egypt shall be yours.

01:34:18.027 --> 01:34:19.995
Hear what I say, Rameses.

01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:26.629
When I cross the river of death,
you will be Pharaoh in Egypt.

01:34:28.705 --> 01:34:31.709
Harden yourself against subordinates.

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:35.215
Put no faith in a brother.

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:38.552
Have no friend.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:41.968
Trust no woman.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:50.314
I protected the helpless,

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:52.945
I nourished the orphan.

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.482
Great one!

01:34:58.651 --> 01:35:03.031
He who ate my bread
and called me father

01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:07.168
would make rebellion against me.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:11.127
What manner of death
do you decree for him?

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.928
I cannot speak it.

01:35:19.005 --> 01:35:21.007
Let it be as you will.

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:26.938
I will not live if you must die!

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:35.355
The feet of a Hebrew slave
is not the right place

01:35:35.521 --> 01:35:37.364
for the next queen of Egypt.

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:44.118
Take him away.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:53.794
- Do not look upon him.
- Traitor to Pharaoh.

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:04.388
Let the name of Moses

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:08.100
be stricken
from every book and tablet.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:15.900
Stricken from all pylons and obelisks.

01:36:16.062 --> 01:36:19.908
Stricken from every monument of Egypt.

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:28.412
Let the name of... Moses...

01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:33.922
...be unheard and unspoken,

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.378
erased from the memory of men

01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:40.424
for all time.

01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:58.612
No, Moses.

01:36:59.605 --> 01:37:02.279
It is I who will possess all of her.

01:37:03.776 --> 01:37:08.247
You think when you are in my arms it
will be his face you will see, not mine?

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:12.127
Yes. Only his face.

01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:14.504
I defeated you in life.

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.960
You shall not defeat me by your death.

01:37:17.123 --> 01:37:22.004
The dead are not scorched
in the desert of desire.

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.470
They do not suffer
from the thirst of passion

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:29.386
or stagger blindly towards
some mirage of lost love.

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:34.808
But you, Hebrew,
will suffer all these things...

01:37:36.142 --> 01:37:38.816
- ...by living.
- You will let him live!

01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:41.401
I will not make him a martyr
for you to cherish.

01:37:41.564 --> 01:37:45.319
No phantom will come between
you and me in the night.

01:37:46.569 --> 01:37:51.075
Yes, my sweet. I will let him live.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.493
Dead...

01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:56.003
...you alone would possess him.

01:37:57.288 --> 01:38:00.508
From where I send him
there is no returning.

01:38:02.001 --> 01:38:04.845
And you will never know

01:38:05.004 --> 01:38:09.384
if he has found forgetfulness
within another woman's arms.

01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:17.354
Now, look upon each other
for the last time.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:58.441
Now, look for the first time,
Abiram, upon the governor of Goshen.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:04.482
Dathan, my brother,
you have the favor of the Lord.

01:39:05.731 --> 01:39:08.610
I prefer the gratitude of the prince.

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:27.796
Nearer.

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:33.597
Yes. Very lovely.

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:36.558
Not that purplish flower.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.392
The purity of white

01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:43.937
will cool the blush of your cheek.

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:52.237
Leave us. All of you.
Yes, you, too, my brother.

01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:56.124
Continue your playing,
but in the house.

01:39:59.035 --> 01:40:00.878
Yes. That's better.

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:07.968
A flower behind a flower.

01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:13.349
Dathan, if you fear God, let me go.

01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:16.227
I'm here, girl, because I put no trust

01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:20.106
in a desert god
and his mud-pit prophet.

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:23.359
I prospered because I bowed lower than
my brothers before the Egyptians.

01:40:23.518 --> 01:40:26.488
Now, the Egyptians bow low before me.

01:40:28.314 --> 01:40:30.237
Joshua wanted you.

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:35.200
Baka wanted you.

01:40:36.322 --> 01:40:38.700
But you belong to me.

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.790
A gift from Rameses to His Excellency.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:50.882
I will bow before you, Dathan.

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:54.015
I will work my hands raw for you.

01:40:55.508 --> 01:40:57.852
But please...

01:40:58.010 --> 01:41:01.731
Please do not shame me
before my Lord.

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:04.392
Your Lord is the governor of Goshen.

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:07.403
What difference to my shame?

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:11.032
No difference to you,
my dove of Canaan.

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:15.696
But to a condemned slave like Joshua,

01:41:15.861 --> 01:41:19.491
it could make the difference
between death on the spikes

01:41:19.657 --> 01:41:24.254
and life in the copper mines of Sinai.

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:30.218
What would you do to influence
His Excellency's clemency?

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:36.974
Anything, Dathan.

01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:41.145
Anything.

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:46.105
Joshua will always
be grateful to you,

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:48.895
my little mud flower.

01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:55.485
His fate is better
than the one that waits for Moses.

01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:10.083
The slave who would be king.

01:42:11.167 --> 01:42:14.296
Captain. Robe of state.

01:42:15.588 --> 01:42:18.933
His Hebrew mother brought it
to the prison before she died.

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:27.775
I'd rather this for your armor.

01:42:27.933 --> 01:42:29.935
You will have need of a scepter.

01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:34.398
Give me this binding pole.

01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:42.665
Here is your king's scepter

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:45.451
and here is your kingdom,

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:50.419
with the scorpion, the cobra
and the lizard for subjects.

01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:54.802
Free them, if you will.
Leave the Hebrews to me.

01:42:56.796 --> 01:42:59.800
Give this prince of Israel
one day's ration of bread and water.

01:42:59.965 --> 01:43:01.342
One day's ration?

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:05.980
It will take many days to cross this
wilderness, if he can cross at all.

01:43:12.478 --> 01:43:17.405
I commend you to your Hebrew god
who has no name.

01:43:18.317 --> 01:43:22.697
If you die, it will be
by his hand, not by mine.

01:43:53.352 --> 01:43:56.526
Farewell, my one-time brother.

01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:13.839
Into the blistering wilderness of Shun

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:18.674
the man who walked with kings
now walks alone.

01:44:19.462 --> 01:44:22.636
Torn from the pinnacle of royal power;

01:44:22.798 --> 01:44:26.052
stripped of all rank and earthly wealth,

01:44:26.218 --> 01:44:29.392
a forsaken man without a country,

01:44:29.555 --> 01:44:31.398
without a hope.

01:44:31.557 --> 01:44:37.235
His soul in turmoil,
like the hot winds and raging sands

01:44:37.396 --> 01:44:40.866
that lash him with the fury
of a taskmaster's whip.

01:44:42.568 --> 01:44:46.539
He is driven forward, always forward,

01:44:46.697 --> 01:44:48.791
by a god unknown

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:51.577
toward a land unseen.

01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:57.425
Into the molten wilderness of sin,

01:44:57.583 --> 01:45:01.929
where granite sentinels
stand as towers of living death

01:45:02.087 --> 01:45:04.385
to bar his way.

01:45:04.548 --> 01:45:09.600
Each night brings
the black embrace of loneliness.

01:45:09.762 --> 01:45:11.981
In the mocking whisper of the wind

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:15.109
he hears the echoing voices of the dark.

01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:17.274
Moses!

01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:20.276
- Moses!
- Moses!

01:45:31.242 --> 01:45:33.244
His tortured mind

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:37.540
wondering if they call
the memory of past triumphs

01:45:37.706 --> 01:45:41.961
or wail foreboding
of disasters yet to come

01:45:42.127 --> 01:45:44.755
or whether the desert's hot breath

01:45:44.922 --> 01:45:49.018
has melted his reason into madness.

01:45:50.553 --> 01:45:54.808
He cannot cool the burning kiss
of thirst upon his lips,

01:45:56.308 --> 01:45:59.312
nor shade the scorching fury of the sun.

01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:05.284
All about is desolation.

01:46:05.442 --> 01:46:09.663
He can neither bless nor curse
the power that moves him,

01:46:10.656 --> 01:46:13.910
for he does not know
from where it comes.

01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:22.176
Learning that it can be more
terrible to live than to die,

01:46:22.334 --> 01:46:27.135
he is driven onward through
the burning crucible of desert,

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:32.304
where holy men and prophets
are cleansed and purged

01:46:32.469 --> 01:46:35.222
for God's great purpose.

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:40.937
Until, at last,
at the end of human strength,

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:44.903
beaten into the dust
from which he came,

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:49.366
the metal is ready
for the Maker's hand.

01:47:08.422 --> 01:47:14.350
And he found strength
from a fruit-laden palm tree

01:47:14.511 --> 01:47:19.563
and life-giving water;
flowing from the well of Midian.

01:47:32.655 --> 01:47:35.659
- If only sheep were men!
- Unmarried men!

01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:38.873
- Can you think of nothing else?
- I don't know. I've never tried!

01:47:39.036 --> 01:47:41.038
I wish sheep
could learn to water themselves.

01:47:41.205 --> 01:47:43.048
You needn't have painted
your nails, Lulua.

01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:44.880
There isn't a man
from here to Horeb.

01:47:57.054 --> 01:48:00.103
- What do you see, Sephora?
- What are you looking at?

01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:03.523
- A man.
- What?

01:48:03.686 --> 01:48:05.154
A man?

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.780
What kind of a man?

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:09.283
- A young man?
- Only one?

01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:10.784
Is he handsome?

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:12.786
- Look at his sandals!
- Egyptian!

01:48:12.945 --> 01:48:16.074
- His robe is not Egyptian.
- Who cares? He's a man.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.583
Yes!

01:48:18.534 --> 01:48:21.913
- He's eaten a whole bunch of dates!
- Could he be dangerous?

01:48:22.079 --> 01:48:24.252
- Are you sure he's alive?
- I hope so!

01:48:24.415 --> 01:48:27.715
- Do you think he's married?
- Look. There's real trouble.

01:48:33.298 --> 01:48:35.346
- Amalekites.
- Amalekites!

01:48:39.596 --> 01:48:42.190
- I'll talk to them.
- Talk to them? Get stones!

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.397
- They'll scatter the flock!
- Desert thieves!

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:52.485
- We drew this water!
- Out of the way, girl!

01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:56.823
This is the well of Jethro, our father.
You have no right here!

01:48:56.989 --> 01:48:59.412
Our goats don't know your father!

01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:02.499
- Jethro's mark is on the well.
- They can't read either.

01:49:02.661 --> 01:49:04.379
Nor can we!

01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:08.042
- He's the Sheik of Midian!
- Then let him breed sons

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.961
-to guard it, not daughters.
- Get your hands off her!

01:49:12.504 --> 01:49:13.847
Drive them away!

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:28.361
Let them be first
whose hands have drawn the water.

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.696
The stranger is wise, and strong.

01:49:32.858 --> 01:49:36.158
Drive back your goats
until the sheep are watered.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.743
All right, all right.

01:49:53.545 --> 01:49:57.846
We should draw water for you
and wash the desert dust from your feet.

01:49:58.467 --> 01:50:00.720
- Of course we should!
- Here's fresh water.

01:50:00.886 --> 01:50:05.016
- I have soap weed.
- Let me first remove his sandals!

01:50:05.641 --> 01:50:08.941
Never did a lost sheep
have so many shepherds.

01:50:09.103 --> 01:50:11.231
- We have no towel.
- My veil will serve.

01:50:11.396 --> 01:50:13.865
- But I...
- Here, let me pour the water!

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:19.367
- Am I to be bathed or drowned?
- I'll hold it for you.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:22.374
Is it true that Egyptian girls
paint their eyes?

01:50:22.533 --> 01:50:26.879
Yes. But very few have eyes
as beautiful as yours.

01:50:29.581 --> 01:50:31.754
And who...?

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:35.171
Who is the brave one who
stood against the Amalekites?

01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:39.183
That's Sephora. She's the oldest.

01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:42.720
Since you have already
divided the stranger among you,

01:50:42.886 --> 01:50:46.356
I will ask a welcome for him
in our father's tent.

01:50:46.515 --> 01:50:49.439
- Our father is Jethro.
- He's Sheik of Midian.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.879
Strength to you, stranger.

01:51:17.045 --> 01:51:21.801
I am Moses,
son of Amram and Yochabel.

01:51:21.967 --> 01:51:26.097
Health, prosperity, life to you,
Jethro of Midian.

01:51:30.601 --> 01:51:33.445
Sephora has told me of your kindness.

01:51:33.604 --> 01:51:36.403
Let us break bread
while my daughter brings meat.

01:51:40.152 --> 01:51:41.825
You have come far.

01:51:43.488 --> 01:51:45.661
From Egypt.

01:51:45.824 --> 01:51:48.498
Across the desert? On foot?

01:51:49.411 --> 01:51:52.836
He who has no name
surely guided your steps.

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:58.341
No name? You Bedouins
know the god of Abraham?

01:51:58.503 --> 01:52:01.382
Abraham is the father of many nations.

01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:04.518
We are the children of Ishmael,
his first-born.

01:52:04.676 --> 01:52:06.974
We are the obedient of God.

01:52:08.847 --> 01:52:11.600
My people look to him for deliverance.

01:52:14.186 --> 01:52:16.530
But they are still in bondage.

01:52:19.024 --> 01:52:23.370
Tomorrow we leave for the high pastures
beneath God's holy mountain.

01:52:23.528 --> 01:52:26.247
My tent would be favored
if you joined us.

01:52:28.617 --> 01:52:31.587
I am a stranger in a strange land.

01:52:31.745 --> 01:52:35.670
I have no wealth,
no skill as a shepherd.

01:52:36.625 --> 01:52:41.381
And it is death to give
sanctuary to a runaway slave.

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:43.514
- Slave?
- Death?

01:52:43.674 --> 01:52:47.053
Not among our people.
You have wisdom.

01:52:47.219 --> 01:52:49.267
You need nothing more.

01:52:49.429 --> 01:52:52.558
And there are seven here to teach you
the tasks of a shepherd.

01:52:54.393 --> 01:52:56.816
Sephora is the eldest.

01:52:56.979 --> 01:52:59.232
You can learn best from her.

01:53:04.027 --> 01:53:06.746
I will dwell in this land.

01:53:27.342 --> 01:53:30.767
- Today he sleeps.
- Who sleeps?

01:53:31.847 --> 01:53:33.599
He who has no name.

01:53:35.809 --> 01:53:38.813
Does your God live on this mountain?

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:42.449
Sinai is his high place. His temple.

01:53:44.276 --> 01:53:46.654
If this god is God,

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:50.495
he would live on every mountain,
in every valley.

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:56.292
He would not be only the god
of Israel or of Ishmael alone,

01:53:56.455 --> 01:53:58.173
but of all men.

01:53:59.333 --> 01:54:02.177
It is said he created all men
in his image.

01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:07.391
And he would dwell in every heart,
in every mind...

01:54:08.633 --> 01:54:10.635
...in every soul.

01:54:14.973 --> 01:54:17.476
I do not know about such things.

01:54:18.977 --> 01:54:23.323
But I do know that the mountain
rumbles when God is there.

01:54:23.482 --> 01:54:25.951
And the earth trembles

01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:29.409
and the cloud is red with fire.

01:54:29.571 --> 01:54:31.994
At such a time,

01:54:32.157 --> 01:54:35.536
has any man ever gone
to see him face to face?

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:39.798
No man has ever set foot
on the forbidden slopes of Sinai.

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:42.964
Why do you want to see him, Moses?

01:54:43.835 --> 01:54:45.678
To know that he is.

01:54:46.838 --> 01:54:49.512
And if he is, to know why
he has not heard the cries

01:54:49.674 --> 01:54:51.972
of slaves in bondage.

01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:56.390
Moses, it would be death
to look upon his face.

01:54:57.682 --> 01:55:02.188
How many of my people have died
because he's turned away his face?

01:55:03.271 --> 01:55:06.241
Can a man judge God?

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.406
No, Moses.
We cannot see his whole purpose.

01:55:12.572 --> 01:55:16.543
Even Ishmael did not know that God
drove him into the desert

01:55:16.701 --> 01:55:18.999
to be the father of a nation.

01:55:20.163 --> 01:55:24.384
Is it not enough to know that he has
saved you from the Pharaoh's anger?

01:55:26.878 --> 01:55:28.801
How do you know that?

01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:34.766
You walk like a prince.
And you tight like a warrior.

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:38.561
There is word in the caravans
of a great one

01:55:38.723 --> 01:55:40.817
who was driven out of Egypt.

01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:46.732
This is not the scepter of a prince,

01:55:46.898 --> 01:55:49.401
but the staff of a wanderer.

01:55:50.402 --> 01:55:52.700
Then rest from wandering.

01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:56.450
My father has many flocks,

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.618
and no son to tend them.

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:02.998
There would be peace of spirit
for you, Moses,

01:56:03.165 --> 01:56:07.466
in our tents beneath the holy mountain.

01:56:08.587 --> 01:56:11.557
You have strong faith in this God,
Sephora.

01:56:14.176 --> 01:56:16.804
But, for me,
there is no peace of spirit

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:20.565
until I hear the word of God,

01:56:20.724 --> 01:56:22.943
from God himself.

01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:33.738
You haven't much time!

01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:38.579
I wish every day
was a shearing festival!

01:56:38.742 --> 01:56:42.747
I know. And all the men following you
like sheep to be sheared!

01:56:42.913 --> 01:56:46.417
- One would be enough for me!
- If he were Moses!

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:51.471
Never before, my brothers,
has our wool brought so rich a payment.

01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:54.133
Because Moses
has sold the whole shearing

01:56:54.299 --> 01:56:57.849
of all the tribes in one piece,
at one price, to Lugal here.

01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:00.730
His words are truth.
His trading is just.

01:57:00.889 --> 01:57:03.517
Peace be with you, sheiks of Sinai.

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:06.527
Why are you dressed like that?

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:08.859
Aren't you going to dance with us
before the sheiks?

01:57:09.022 --> 01:57:13.994
No, I am not going to dance
before the sheiks. Here.

01:57:15.153 --> 01:57:19.203
And I am not going to be displayed
like a caravan's wares

01:57:19.366 --> 01:57:22.620
before Moses or any other man.

01:57:23.495 --> 01:57:25.418
Tonight I tend the sheep.

01:57:26.831 --> 01:57:30.586
You needn't laugh.
Moses may not choose you either!

01:57:33.922 --> 01:57:36.425
Moses shall no longer
be a stranger among us.

01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:39.344
- We should give him of our flocks.
- And let him choose.

01:57:39.511 --> 01:57:42.640
I shall give him choice
of my seven daughters for wife.

01:57:42.806 --> 01:57:43.853
Seven to choose from.

01:57:44.015 --> 01:57:45.483
- A strong son.
- A happy union.

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:49.730
The shadow of my wisdom has fled.

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:53.366
Can a man choose
from among the stars of the sky?

01:57:53.525 --> 01:57:55.869
Consider them as they dance.

01:57:56.027 --> 01:57:58.200
Cohath, strike your bow.

01:58:19.843 --> 01:58:23.097
- A pleasant task.
- Indeed!

01:58:26.266 --> 01:58:29.486
A bride, a shawl.
Choose one, not all.

01:58:29.644 --> 01:58:33.740
One shawl, one wife.
Your choice for life.

01:58:46.494 --> 01:58:48.496
Pearls of great price.

01:59:08.266 --> 01:59:10.735
- Which, Moses?
- Which will it be?

01:59:10.894 --> 01:59:12.771
Make your choice, Moses.

01:59:12.937 --> 01:59:15.690
It is a garden of many flowers, Moses.

01:59:15.857 --> 01:59:20.112
I wish you had my years
and I had your choice.

01:59:21.237 --> 01:59:26.334
In the tent of Jethro
there is dignity, honor, freedom

01:59:27.285 --> 01:59:28.787
and beauty.

01:59:29.412 --> 01:59:31.631
All that a man could ask of life.

01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:34.634
But my heart is still
a prisoner of the past.

01:59:34.793 --> 01:59:38.388
I... I cannot choose now.

01:59:40.924 --> 01:59:45.475
- Strength to you, sheiks of Sinai.
- May God guide your heart.

01:59:45.637 --> 01:59:47.389
Moses!

01:59:56.690 --> 01:59:58.818
Tonight he is awake.

02:00:02.654 --> 02:00:05.077
Which of my sisters did you choose?

02:00:08.535 --> 02:00:10.958
I made no choice, Sephora.

02:00:17.502 --> 02:00:20.346
She was very beautiful, wasn't she?

02:00:20.505 --> 02:00:25.181
This woman of Egypt
who left her scar upon your heart.

02:00:30.223 --> 02:00:32.976
Her skin was white as curd.

02:00:34.227 --> 02:00:37.151
Her eyes,
green as the cedars of Lebanon.

02:00:38.189 --> 02:00:41.409
Her lips, tamarisk honey.

02:00:41.568 --> 02:00:44.868
Like the breast of a dove,
her arms were soft.

02:00:47.615 --> 02:00:50.744
And the wine of desire
was in her veins.

02:00:52.036 --> 02:00:55.381
Yes. She was beautiful...

02:00:57.125 --> 02:00:58.923
...as a jewel.

02:00:59.794 --> 02:01:04.766
A jewel has brilliant fire,
but gives no warmth.

02:01:08.553 --> 02:01:13.150
Our hands are not so soft,
but they can serve.

02:01:13.308 --> 02:01:18.155
Our bodies not so white,
but they are strong.

02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:21.449
Our lips are not perfumed...

02:01:23.318 --> 02:01:25.741
...but they speak the truth.

02:01:26.905 --> 02:01:29.328
Love is not an art to us.

02:01:30.366 --> 02:01:32.585
It's life to us.

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:38.800
We are not dressed
in gold and fine linen.

02:01:39.667 --> 02:01:42.796
Strength and honor are our clothing.

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:48.844
Our tents are not
the columned halls of Egypt,

02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:51.980
but our children
play happily before them.

02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:57.569
We can offer you little...

02:01:59.896 --> 02:02:02.900
...but we offer all we have.

02:02:03.066 --> 02:02:07.663
I have not little, Sephora.
I have nothing.

02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:10.370
Nothing from some

02:02:10.532 --> 02:02:13.126
is more than gold from others.

02:02:15.411 --> 02:02:18.756
You would fill
the emptiness of my heart?

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:24.796
I could never fill all of it, Moses.

02:02:26.297 --> 02:02:29.346
But I shall not be jealous of a memory.

02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:16.811
May the gods bless you

02:03:16.973 --> 02:03:19.692
as you go to join them

02:03:19.851 --> 02:03:22.695
in the land of the dead.

02:03:23.897 --> 02:03:25.899
The old windbag.

02:03:28.359 --> 02:03:30.657
What an infernal fuss.

02:03:32.196 --> 02:03:35.871
After all,
dying is only a part of living.

02:03:36.034 --> 02:03:38.662
You won't die, old crocodile.

02:03:38.828 --> 02:03:42.753
You'll cheat death the way
you cheat me at hounds and jackals.

02:03:44.042 --> 02:03:47.387
I'm afraid he won't let me cheat
the way you do.

02:03:51.841 --> 02:03:55.220
You'll be Pharaoh by sunset, Rameses.

02:03:57.472 --> 02:04:02.444
I hope you're content... at last.

02:04:02.602 --> 02:04:05.276
I am content to be your son.

02:04:06.522 --> 02:04:09.401
You have restored Egypt
to her greatness.

02:04:10.318 --> 02:04:14.744
I shall make her greatness
feared among nations.

02:04:14.906 --> 02:04:18.786
No doubt, no doubt.
You can overcome anything,

02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:21.751
but your own arrogance.

02:04:22.538 --> 02:04:24.882
Don't exhaust yourself, great one.

02:04:25.583 --> 02:04:30.635
- Dear great one.
- Why not, kitten?

02:04:30.797 --> 02:04:33.926
You are the only thing I regret leaving.

02:04:34.926 --> 02:04:37.099
You have been my joy.

02:04:38.096 --> 02:04:42.146
- And you, my only love.
- Uh-huh.

02:04:43.643 --> 02:04:45.737
Now you're cheating.

02:04:47.271 --> 02:04:50.491
- There was another.
- Yes.

02:04:54.195 --> 02:04:55.788
I know.

02:04:57.573 --> 02:04:59.701
I loved him, too.

02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:05.587
With my last breath,
I'll break my own law

02:05:05.748 --> 02:05:08.126
and speak the name of...

02:05:09.877 --> 02:05:11.800
...Moses.

02:05:13.965 --> 02:05:15.592
Moses.

02:05:26.644 --> 02:05:28.817
The royal falcon

02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:31.358
has flown into the sun.

02:05:55.339 --> 02:05:58.809
Did the little boy die in the desert,
my father?

02:05:58.968 --> 02:06:03.314
No. God brought Ishmael and
his mother, Hagar, into a good land.

02:06:03.473 --> 02:06:06.818
The same God who lives
on the mountain?

02:06:07.769 --> 02:06:12.866
- It may be, my son.
- Moses! Moses!

02:06:13.024 --> 02:06:15.197
Your mother is calling.

02:06:17.487 --> 02:06:18.534
Here!

02:06:21.532 --> 02:06:25.287
Moses! There is a man among the sheep!

02:06:25.453 --> 02:06:26.955
You stay...

02:06:28.998 --> 02:06:33.469
You keep sounding the alarm, Gershom.
But stay here till your mother comes.

02:06:38.883 --> 02:06:40.931
In the cleft, behind the rock.

02:06:41.094 --> 02:06:43.563
Your eyes are sharp
as they are beautiful.

02:07:00.196 --> 02:07:01.573
Turfa!

02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:04.742
Khataf! Back!

02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:07.378
Khataf! Back!

02:07:10.331 --> 02:07:13.084
Back, Khataf. Come down!

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.337
Moses.

02:07:18.256 --> 02:07:19.758
Down, Turfa!

02:07:24.011 --> 02:07:26.810
Praise God I have found you!

02:07:27.723 --> 02:07:29.976
Joshua?

02:07:30.143 --> 02:07:31.941
We thought you dead.

02:07:32.103 --> 02:07:36.233
In the copper mines of Geber,
the living are dead.

02:07:36.399 --> 02:07:39.653
Sephora! Bring water.

02:07:45.283 --> 02:07:47.456
How did you find me?

02:07:47.618 --> 02:07:49.541
A merchant buying copper

02:07:49.704 --> 02:07:52.127
saw you in the tent of Jethro.

02:07:54.792 --> 02:07:57.545
Here, you too will find peace.

02:07:58.838 --> 02:08:00.385
Peace?

02:08:01.966 --> 02:08:04.765
How can you find peace or want it,

02:08:04.927 --> 02:08:08.352
when Rameses builds cities mortared
with the blood of our people?

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:11.313
You must lead them out of Egypt!

02:08:11.475 --> 02:08:15.400
God made a covenant with Abraham
that he would deliver the people.

02:08:16.606 --> 02:08:18.825
Am I the hand of God?

02:08:19.567 --> 02:08:23.037
- Sephora, give him water.
- Water! Bless you!

02:08:23.196 --> 02:08:25.995
The desert sun has set fire to his mind.

02:08:26.699 --> 02:08:29.498
His name is Joshua.

02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:32.504
I once killed that he might live.

02:08:33.748 --> 02:08:36.092
They told me you were condemned,

02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:40.676
but I knew you were chosen to take
the sword of God into your hand!

02:08:40.838 --> 02:08:43.011
I am not the man.

02:08:44.675 --> 02:08:47.269
I am a shepherd with flocks...

02:08:48.930 --> 02:08:51.683
That light on the mountainside...

02:08:53.184 --> 02:08:56.108
Do you see that strange tire?

02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:59.365
- A bush that burns?
- No.

02:08:59.523 --> 02:09:02.743
It is on fire,
but the bush does not burn.

02:09:02.902 --> 02:09:07.203
Sephora, take him.
Serve him food in our tent.

02:09:07.365 --> 02:09:10.835
I will turn aside
and see this great sight.

02:10:35.828 --> 02:10:37.421
Moses.

02:10:40.916 --> 02:10:43.260
Moses.

02:10:47.006 --> 02:10:48.474
I am here.

02:10:49.425 --> 02:10:53.475
Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.

02:10:53.929 --> 02:10:58.901
For the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground.

02:11:04.815 --> 02:11:07.910
I am the God of thy father.

02:11:09.612 --> 02:11:12.206
The God of Abraham,

02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:14.242
the God of Isaac

02:11:14.408 --> 02:11:16.831
and the God of Jacob.

02:11:18.913 --> 02:11:20.506
Lord...

02:11:22.416 --> 02:11:25.636
Lord, why do you not hear the cries

02:11:25.795 --> 02:11:29.299
of their children
in the bondage of Egypt?

02:11:29.465 --> 02:11:34.517
I have surely seen the affliction
of my people which are in Egypt.

02:11:36.013 --> 02:11:41.520
And I have heard their cry
by reason of their taskmasters.

02:11:42.436 --> 02:11:45.280
For I know their sorrows.

02:11:45.439 --> 02:11:49.444
Therefore, I will send thee, Moses,

02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:52.159
unto Pharaoh,

02:11:52.321 --> 02:11:57.043
that thou mayest bring my people
out of Egypt.

02:11:57.201 --> 02:12:02.048
Who am I, Lord,
that you should send me?

02:12:04.041 --> 02:12:07.386
How can I lead this people
out of bondage?

02:12:09.004 --> 02:12:12.725
What words can I speak
that they will heed?

02:12:12.883 --> 02:12:18.105
I will teach thee what thou wilt say.

02:12:18.264 --> 02:12:21.484
When thou hast brought forth
the people,

02:12:21.642 --> 02:12:25.397
they shall serve me upon this mountain.

02:12:26.439 --> 02:12:30.694
I will put my laws into their hearts.

02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:34.490
And in their minds will I write them.

02:12:35.531 --> 02:12:38.375
Now, therefore, go.

02:12:39.076 --> 02:12:41.875
And I will be with thee.

02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:44.923
But if I say to your children

02:12:45.082 --> 02:12:48.586
that the God of their fathers
has sent me,

02:12:48.752 --> 02:12:51.596
they will ask, "What is his name?"

02:12:51.755 --> 02:12:54.133
And how shall I answer them?

02:12:55.217 --> 02:12:58.767
I am that I am.

02:13:00.181 --> 02:13:02.525
Thou shalt say,

02:13:02.683 --> 02:13:06.904
"l am hath sent me unto you."

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:22.207
Is the holy mountain
forbidden to men?

02:13:22.369 --> 02:13:25.623
Yes. And I am afraid for him.

02:13:25.789 --> 02:13:29.293
Then he is more than man, for look...

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.648
Look at his face.

02:13:47.645 --> 02:13:49.739
He has seen God.

02:14:08.165 --> 02:14:14.013
Moses... your hair... your sandals.

02:14:14.171 --> 02:14:16.674
I stood upon holy ground.

02:14:18.092 --> 02:14:20.686
Can you tell us, Moses?

02:14:20.844 --> 02:14:23.347
My eyes could not look upon him.

02:14:23.514 --> 02:14:25.232
Did he speak?

02:14:26.141 --> 02:14:29.361
He revealed his word to my mind.

02:14:31.146 --> 02:14:33.240
And the word was God.

02:14:33.399 --> 02:14:35.948
Did he speak as a man?

02:14:36.110 --> 02:14:39.455
He is not flesh but spirit.

02:14:39.613 --> 02:14:42.207
The light of eternal mind.

02:14:43.158 --> 02:14:46.833
And I know that his light
is in every man.

02:14:46.996 --> 02:14:49.215
Did he ask something of you?

02:14:52.001 --> 02:14:54.720
That I go to Egypt.

02:14:54.878 --> 02:14:59.475
You are God's messenger!
He has set the day of deliverance.

02:14:59.633 --> 02:15:02.352
I will get water and bread
that we may leave at once.

02:15:02.511 --> 02:15:04.889
But Egypt holds death for you.

02:15:05.055 --> 02:15:07.183
If it be his will.

02:15:08.851 --> 02:15:11.821
Where he sends you, I shall go.

02:15:11.979 --> 02:15:14.732
Your God is my God.

02:15:14.898 --> 02:15:18.448
I will lead men against the armory
at Migdol and get swords for the people!

02:15:18.611 --> 02:15:22.036
It is not by the sword
that he will deliver his people,

02:15:22.906 --> 02:15:25.409
but by the staff of a shepherd.

02:18:07.613 --> 02:18:10.287
And the Lord said unto Moses,

02:18:10.449 --> 02:18:13.999
"Go. Return into Egypt. "

02:18:14.161 --> 02:18:16.960
And Moses took his wife and his son

02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:20.217
and he returned to the land of Egypt.

02:18:20.375 --> 02:18:24.255
And Moses took the rod of God
in his hand.

02:18:25.923 --> 02:18:31.430
Let the ambassador from Priam,
king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.

02:18:37.643 --> 02:18:41.773
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy
is a fabulous fabric

02:18:41.939 --> 02:18:44.067
from the land of the five rivers.

02:18:49.655 --> 02:18:53.501
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.

02:18:53.659 --> 02:18:57.630
- It shimmers like the Nile. What is it?
- How is it made?

02:18:57.788 --> 02:19:02.089
No one knows, great Pharaoh.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.

02:19:02.251 --> 02:19:06.427
- They call it silk.
- The ambassador from Jericho.

02:19:10.425 --> 02:19:12.803
What kingdom has sent you?

02:19:12.970 --> 02:19:15.473
The kingdom of the Most High.

02:19:18.767 --> 02:19:21.896
These must be ambassadors from...

02:19:22.062 --> 02:19:23.655
Bedouins?

02:19:25.399 --> 02:19:30.496
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.

02:19:41.164 --> 02:19:42.290
What is this word?

02:19:42.457 --> 02:19:46.087
Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel,

02:19:46.253 --> 02:19:48.301
"Let my people go!"

02:19:48.463 --> 02:19:50.841
The slaves are mine.

02:19:51.008 --> 02:19:53.682
Their lives are mine.

02:19:53.844 --> 02:19:56.347
All that they own is mine.

02:19:58.015 --> 02:20:00.734
I do not know your God,

02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:02.987
nor will I let Israel go.

02:20:03.687 --> 02:20:07.442
Who are you to make their lives
bitter in hard bondage?

02:20:07.608 --> 02:20:11.863
Men shall be ruled by law,
not the will of other men.

02:20:13.697 --> 02:20:17.873
Who is this God
that I should let your people go?

02:20:18.035 --> 02:20:19.662
Aaron.

02:20:21.204 --> 02:20:24.299
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh

02:20:24.458 --> 02:20:27.962
that he may see the power of God.

02:20:29.796 --> 02:20:33.767
In this you shall know
that the Lord is God.

02:20:44.728 --> 02:20:46.605
Mother! Mother!

02:20:46.772 --> 02:20:49.150
He turned his staff into a cobra!

02:20:53.195 --> 02:20:55.539
Nothing of his will harm you, my son.

02:21:02.412 --> 02:21:06.258
The power of your God
is a cheap magician's trick.

02:21:06.416 --> 02:21:07.759
Jannes.

02:21:26.269 --> 02:21:27.816
Mother, look!

02:21:35.988 --> 02:21:39.083
Jannes, do you see?

02:21:39.616 --> 02:21:41.835
Moses' serpent swallows up the others.

02:21:51.837 --> 02:21:56.138
You gave me this staff
to rule over scorpions and serpents,

02:21:56.299 --> 02:22:00.224
but God made it a rod
to rule over kings.

02:22:00.929 --> 02:22:04.900
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.

02:22:07.019 --> 02:22:08.396
Obey?

02:22:09.271 --> 02:22:11.569
Moses, Moses.

02:22:12.691 --> 02:22:14.193
Are there no magicians in Egypt

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:17.829
that you have come back
to make serpents out of sticks?

02:22:17.988 --> 02:22:20.707
Or cause rabbits to appear?

02:22:28.665 --> 02:22:32.420
I will give your staff
a greater wonder to perform.

02:22:34.046 --> 02:22:37.220
Bear it before your idle people

02:22:37.382 --> 02:22:40.682
and bid them make bricks without straw.

02:22:40.844 --> 02:22:42.812
How can people make bricks
without straw?

02:22:42.971 --> 02:22:45.065
Let his staff provide them with it.

02:22:47.142 --> 02:22:50.362
Or let them glean straw in the fields
for themselves.

02:22:54.691 --> 02:22:57.945
But their tally of bricks
shall not diminish.

02:22:58.528 --> 02:23:00.530
So let it be written.

02:23:01.948 --> 02:23:03.291
So let it be done.

02:23:22.052 --> 02:23:23.770
We are free!

02:23:31.812 --> 02:23:36.113
Aaron! Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:38.697
We do not leave Egypt.

02:23:40.487 --> 02:23:42.740
But Moses promised us.

02:23:43.865 --> 02:23:46.118
But you said we'd be freed!

02:23:47.327 --> 02:23:50.251
I have brought more evil upon you.

02:23:51.331 --> 02:23:55.381
God forgive my weak use
of his strength.

02:23:55.544 --> 02:23:58.718
- Weak use?
- Moses, what have you done to us?

02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:03.386
It is Pharaoh's order
that you be given no straw

02:24:03.552 --> 02:24:07.227
-to make your tally of bricks.
- No straw?

02:24:09.391 --> 02:24:12.361
How can we make bricks without straw?

02:24:12.519 --> 02:24:16.695
You will glean the stubble
of the fields by night.

02:24:16.857 --> 02:24:18.734
And your women and children, too.

02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:20.952
Is this the deliverer?

02:24:21.111 --> 02:24:23.364
You've brought
the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!

02:24:23.530 --> 02:24:26.033
You put a sword in their hands
to kill us!

02:24:26.199 --> 02:24:28.918
Stone him! Stone him!

02:24:37.502 --> 02:24:40.346
Stand aside! Come!

02:24:42.799 --> 02:24:44.267
Follow!

02:24:50.849 --> 02:24:55.730
There goes your deliverer.
Now, go find your straw.

02:24:55.896 --> 02:25:00.151
Remember, the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.

02:25:28.678 --> 02:25:31.181
I cursed you.

02:25:31.348 --> 02:25:36.320
Each time Rameses took me
in his arms, I cursed you, not him,

02:25:36.478 --> 02:25:39.231
because I love you.

02:25:39.397 --> 02:25:42.571
The Moses who loved you
was another man.

02:25:42.734 --> 02:25:44.782
No, he was not.

02:25:45.946 --> 02:25:49.371
You believe you've changed,
but you haven't.

02:25:49.532 --> 02:25:53.287
You call yourself a prophet,
a man of God,

02:25:53.453 --> 02:25:55.876
but I know better.

02:25:56.039 --> 02:25:59.919
I don't believe that only the thunder
of a mountain stirs your heart,

02:26:00.085 --> 02:26:02.304
as you stir mine.

02:26:02.462 --> 02:26:07.639
Nefretiri, I have stood in the
burning light of God's own presence.

02:26:09.886 --> 02:26:12.514
It was not he who saved you just now.

02:26:12.681 --> 02:26:14.809
I did that.

02:26:14.975 --> 02:26:17.603
Oh, Moses, Moses.

02:26:18.561 --> 02:26:23.158
Why, of all men, did I fall in love
with the prince of fools?

02:26:25.318 --> 02:26:29.573
But I believe anything you tell me
when I'm in your arms.

02:26:30.824 --> 02:26:33.373
Why must you deny me and yourself?

02:26:33.535 --> 02:26:36.539
Because I am bound to a God

02:26:36.705 --> 02:26:39.709
and to a people
and to a shepherd girl.

02:26:42.544 --> 02:26:46.515
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?

02:26:47.507 --> 02:26:51.182
Unless the desert sun
has dulled your senses.

02:26:52.262 --> 02:26:56.859
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?

02:26:57.017 --> 02:27:01.022
Or is it soft as mine?

02:27:01.187 --> 02:27:04.236
Are her lips chafed and dry
as the desert sand?

02:27:04.399 --> 02:27:07.778
Or are they moist and red

02:27:07.944 --> 02:27:10.038
like a pomegranate?

02:27:12.282 --> 02:27:16.378
Is it the fragrance of myrrh
that scents her hair?

02:27:17.871 --> 02:27:20.249
Or is it the odor of sheep?

02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:25.470
There is a beauty
beyond the senses, Nefretiri.

02:27:26.421 --> 02:27:31.803
Beauty like the quiet
of green valleys and still waters.

02:27:32.886 --> 02:27:36.481
Beauty of the spirit
that you cannot understand.

02:27:39.142 --> 02:27:40.689
Perhaps not.

02:27:43.146 --> 02:27:46.650
But beauty of the spirit
will not free your people, Moses.

02:27:47.901 --> 02:27:53.579
You will come to me
or they will never leave Egypt.

02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:57.836
The fate of Israel
is not in your hands, Nefretiri.

02:27:57.994 --> 02:27:59.962
Oh, isn't it?

02:28:00.663 --> 02:28:03.462
Who else can soften Pharaoh's heart?

02:28:05.293 --> 02:28:07.341
Or harden it?

02:28:09.506 --> 02:28:10.849
Yes-

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:14.014
You may be the lovely dust

02:28:14.177 --> 02:28:17.397
through which God
will work his purpose.

02:28:24.938 --> 02:28:27.566
Fill every jar in your house with water-

02:28:27.732 --> 02:28:30.110
Tell the others that for seven days
there will be none to drink.

02:28:30.276 --> 02:28:33.246
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.

02:28:33.405 --> 02:28:34.622
What does it mean?

02:28:34.781 --> 02:28:38.502
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.

02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:41.004
So fill your jars or go thirsty.

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.428
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, I'm going back for more jars.

02:28:47.585 --> 02:28:49.258
No water for seven days.

02:28:50.213 --> 02:28:52.307
Yes, Joshua.

02:28:52.465 --> 02:28:54.513
She comes to the well every day.

02:28:55.343 --> 02:28:57.687
Wait, and you will see her.

02:29:06.229 --> 02:29:09.733
It is wise of Dathan
to send you to the well, Lilia,

02:29:09.899 --> 02:29:12.368
or he might find his water poisoned.

02:29:15.029 --> 02:29:17.077
They told me you were dead.

02:29:19.659 --> 02:29:23.004
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.

02:29:25.915 --> 02:29:30.887
- Dathan?
- Yes. Dathan.

02:29:31.421 --> 02:29:34.300
Of your own free will?

02:29:34.466 --> 02:29:36.719
Of my own free will.

02:29:38.428 --> 02:29:42.274
You are no man's slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.

02:29:42.432 --> 02:29:44.776
Not for me, Joshua.

02:29:49.689 --> 02:29:52.363
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!

02:29:52.525 --> 02:29:55.278
Thy life-giving waters
are the blood of Egypt.

02:29:56.446 --> 02:29:59.290
Hail to thee, maker of barley,

02:29:59.449 --> 02:30:03.295
feeder of cattle, carrier of ships,

02:30:03.453 --> 02:30:06.081
greatest of all the gods.

02:30:06.247 --> 02:30:10.969
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.

02:30:11.127 --> 02:30:13.926
Let my people go!

02:30:15.006 --> 02:30:17.008
- The point of the sword...
- Let him rave on,

02:30:17.175 --> 02:30:19.598
that men shall know him mad.

02:30:22.388 --> 02:30:24.311
Obey the Lord,

02:30:24.474 --> 02:30:27.978
or he will raise his hand
against the waters of the river.

02:30:28.144 --> 02:30:32.365
I have come to bless the waters,
you have come to curse them.

02:30:32.524 --> 02:30:36.870
We will learn if a god of shepherds
is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.

02:30:37.987 --> 02:30:41.617
Water of life,
give drink to the desert

02:30:41.783 --> 02:30:45.162
- and make green the meadow.
- Aaron.

02:30:46.996 --> 02:30:50.170
Stretch out my staff
against the waters.

02:31:00.093 --> 02:31:02.391
- Look!
- There!

02:31:02.554 --> 02:31:04.727
Where he struck the river,
it bleeds.

02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:06.891
The water turns to blood!

02:31:17.151 --> 02:31:19.199
Blood flows from the god!

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:22.953
See how it spreads.

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:27.711
It is blood!

02:31:35.003 --> 02:31:38.382
That you may know
the power of the Lord,

02:31:38.548 --> 02:31:42.052
for seven days, Egypt will thirst.

02:31:42.218 --> 02:31:45.062
Seven days without water!
Fill every jug and jar!

02:31:45.221 --> 02:31:49.271
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
- Were it seven times seven days,

02:31:49.434 --> 02:31:53.234
no magician's trick
will set your people free.

02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:59.698
Sacred water,

02:31:59.861 --> 02:32:04.287
make pure the flood
from which you came.

02:32:13.625 --> 02:32:18.131
And God smote the land
with all manner of plagues,

02:32:18.296 --> 02:32:21.266
but still Pharaoh 's heart
was hardened.

02:32:30.516 --> 02:32:33.565
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.

02:32:33.728 --> 02:32:36.698
They would cry louder
if they had to make the bricks.

02:32:38.524 --> 02:32:40.117
- Send them away.
- The people have been plagued

02:32:40.276 --> 02:32:44.452
by thirst, they've been plagued
by frogs, by lice, by flies,

02:32:44.614 --> 02:32:46.833
by sickness, by boils.
They can endure no more.

02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:48.334
Back to your homes!

02:32:48.493 --> 02:32:50.587
Why do you bring
this worker of evil before me?

02:32:50.745 --> 02:32:53.464
The people desert the temples.

02:32:53.623 --> 02:32:56.172
- They turn from the gods.
- What gods?

02:32:56.334 --> 02:32:58.132
You prophets and priests
made the gods,

02:32:58.294 --> 02:33:01.719
that you may prey upon
the fears of men.

02:33:01.881 --> 02:33:05.806
When the Nile ran red,
I too was afraid,

02:33:05.968 --> 02:33:09.097
until word came of a mountain
beyond the cataracts

02:33:09.263 --> 02:33:13.018
which spewed red mud
and poisoned the water.

02:33:14.143 --> 02:33:17.022
Was it the staff I gave you
that caused all this?

02:33:17.188 --> 02:33:19.316
Was it the wonder of your god
that fish should die

02:33:19.482 --> 02:33:21.484
and frogs should leave the waters?

02:33:21.651 --> 02:33:24.905
Was it a miracle that flies and lice
should bloat upon their carrion

02:33:25.071 --> 02:33:27.699
and spread disease
in both man and beast?

02:33:28.533 --> 02:33:32.003
These things were ordered
by themselves,

02:33:32.161 --> 02:33:34.789
not by any god!

02:33:34.956 --> 02:33:36.799
Now, go.

02:33:41.921 --> 02:33:45.346
That you may know
these things are done of God...

02:33:50.555 --> 02:33:54.185
...you shall see hail fall
from a clear sky

02:33:54.350 --> 02:33:58.025
and burn as fire upon the ground.

02:33:58.187 --> 02:34:00.531
You shall see darkness cover Egypt

02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:03.944
when the sun climbs high to noon.

02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:07.865
And you shall know that God is God

02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:11.159
and bow down to his will.

02:34:11.325 --> 02:34:16.502
Nothing of this Earth
can make me bow to you, Moses.

02:34:16.664 --> 02:34:19.918
Behold, the hail comes.

02:34:20.877 --> 02:34:24.427
When darkness has covered Egypt
for three days,

02:34:24.589 --> 02:34:27.388
your ministers will send for me.

02:35:11.427 --> 02:35:12.770
In the three days of darkness,

02:35:12.929 --> 02:35:16.809
you have whined like
frightened children in the night.

02:35:16.974 --> 02:35:21.024
Moses said the sun would shine
in three days and it is true.

02:35:21.187 --> 02:35:23.110
Oh, great one, let his people go,

02:35:23.272 --> 02:35:27.322
or all of Egypt will be barren
from the cataracts to the sea.

02:35:28.945 --> 02:35:31.414
Will my father free the slaves?

02:35:31.572 --> 02:35:34.792
Can taxes be collected
from dead cattle and blighted harvests?

02:35:34.951 --> 02:35:39.297
Does fear rule Egypt, or do I?

02:35:39.455 --> 02:35:41.457
We fear no army of the Earth,

02:35:41.624 --> 02:35:43.592
but can we fight plagues with swords?

02:35:43.751 --> 02:35:45.003
There is no shame in this.

02:35:45.169 --> 02:35:46.466
The strongest tree bends.

02:35:46.629 --> 02:35:50.054
It is not Pharaoh
who yields to the slave,

02:35:51.092 --> 02:35:52.890
but his counselors.

02:35:53.052 --> 02:35:56.647
I have summoned Moses
at your request.

02:35:58.641 --> 02:36:00.643
People will bless you, great one.

02:36:00.810 --> 02:36:02.858
No other choice, Pharaoh.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:06.991
Does the world bow
to an empty throne?

02:36:07.149 --> 02:36:09.277
Empty?

02:36:09.443 --> 02:36:13.323
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart
against his son?

02:36:13.489 --> 02:36:17.119
If you let the Hebrews go,
who will build his cities?

02:36:17.285 --> 02:36:20.334
You told Moses
to make bricks without straw.

02:36:20.496 --> 02:36:24.342
Now, he tells you
to make cities without bricks!

02:36:25.793 --> 02:36:29.889
Who is the slave,
and who is the Pharaoh?

02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:34.014
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?

02:36:34.176 --> 02:36:37.521
Yes, the laughter of kings

02:36:38.097 --> 02:36:40.850
in Babylon, in Canaan,

02:36:41.017 --> 02:36:42.894
in Troy,

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:49.151
as Egypt surrenders
to the god of slaves!

02:36:55.114 --> 02:36:57.242
Bring the Hebrew in.

02:37:01.037 --> 02:37:04.541
Go into the garden.
It's not good for a son of Pharaoh

02:37:04.707 --> 02:37:08.712
to see his father humbled
by a son of slaves.

02:37:08.878 --> 02:37:12.724
My son, stand beside me.

02:37:20.056 --> 02:37:24.607
Have the days of darkness
made you see the light, Rameses?

02:37:25.227 --> 02:37:27.400
Will you now free my people?

02:37:27.563 --> 02:37:31.113
Great one,
bid the scribe read the order.

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:33.073
Give me the writing.

02:37:39.533 --> 02:37:40.705
Sublime, ye Pharaoh.

02:37:40.868 --> 02:37:43.041
You cannot resist the power
of his god!

02:37:43.204 --> 02:37:45.707
I know not his god!

02:37:45.873 --> 02:37:48.001
Neither will I let his people go.

02:37:55.508 --> 02:37:59.729
How long will you refuse
to humble yourself before God?

02:38:00.763 --> 02:38:03.937
If you bring another plague upon us,

02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:08.606
it is not your god but I who will
turn the Nile red with blood.

02:38:08.771 --> 02:38:12.241
As your father's father
turned the streets of Goshen red

02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:14.869
with the blood of our male children!

02:38:15.027 --> 02:38:18.372
If there is one more plague on Egypt,

02:38:18.531 --> 02:38:22.286
it is by your word
that God will bring it.

02:38:22.451 --> 02:38:26.627
And there shall be so great a cry
throughout the land

02:38:26.789 --> 02:38:30.589
that you will surely
let the people go.

02:38:33.504 --> 02:38:36.098
Come to me no more, Moses,

02:38:36.257 --> 02:38:40.228
for on the day
you see my face again,

02:38:40.386 --> 02:38:42.730
you will surely die.

02:38:44.056 --> 02:38:46.024
So let it be written.

02:38:52.606 --> 02:38:55.655
I will give this spawn of slaves
and his god

02:38:55.818 --> 02:38:58.196
an answer the world will not forget!

02:38:59.071 --> 02:39:04.077
Commander of the Host,
call on the chariots from Tanis.

02:39:04.243 --> 02:39:07.668
There shall be one more plague,

02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:10.959
only it will come upon
the slaves of Goshen!

02:39:11.751 --> 02:39:14.846
First-born of each house shall die,

02:39:16.005 --> 02:39:18.349
beginning with the son of Moses.

02:39:53.459 --> 02:39:56.508
You are the shepherd girl
that Moses married?

02:39:56.670 --> 02:40:01.676
The queen of Egypt is beautiful,
as he told me.

02:40:04.637 --> 02:40:06.605
My husband is not here.

02:40:14.063 --> 02:40:16.737
Is this Moses' son?

02:40:16.899 --> 02:40:18.993
Yes, this is our son.

02:40:19.902 --> 02:40:22.405
What do you want of us?

02:40:22.571 --> 02:40:24.790
You need have no fear of me.

02:40:26.033 --> 02:40:28.661
I feared only his memory of you.

02:40:30.412 --> 02:40:32.881
You have been able to erase it?

02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:37.128
He has forgotten both of us.

02:40:39.922 --> 02:40:43.017
You lost him
when he went to seek his God.

02:40:44.426 --> 02:40:47.555
I lost him when he found his God.

02:40:49.056 --> 02:40:51.980
At least he left you
a son to cherish.

02:40:53.435 --> 02:40:55.938
I am here to save his son.

02:40:57.398 --> 02:40:59.617
- From what?
- From Pharaoh's decree

02:40:59.775 --> 02:41:02.449
that the first-born
of Israel must die.

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:06.032
Die?

02:41:07.616 --> 02:41:09.789
God of Abraham!

02:41:11.036 --> 02:41:16.133
Don't let him do this!
Not to the children!

02:41:16.292 --> 02:41:19.171
A caravan for Midian
is waiting for you and your son.

02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:21.304
My chariot will bring you to it.

02:41:46.655 --> 02:41:48.874
I'm surprised you noticed me.

02:41:50.159 --> 02:41:53.003
You didn't at the palace this morning,
you know?

02:41:53.162 --> 02:41:56.962
Why? Were you afraid to look at me?

02:41:58.167 --> 02:42:00.340
What do you want, Nefretiri?

02:42:00.502 --> 02:42:03.005
You, Moses.

02:42:03.172 --> 02:42:05.345
Everything about us
is coming to an end!

02:42:06.425 --> 02:42:09.520
You will destroy Egypt
or Egypt will destroy you.

02:42:10.346 --> 02:42:12.440
I belong to you, Moses.

02:42:18.145 --> 02:42:21.194
She's gone with your son to Midian.

02:42:21.357 --> 02:42:23.280
Why would she leave?

02:42:23.442 --> 02:42:27.072
She knew you would try to save the
other children before your own son.

02:42:27.238 --> 02:42:29.411
Save the other children? From what?

02:42:29.573 --> 02:42:33.749
Rameses is massing the Libyan axmen,
the chariots, the Sardinian swordsmen.

02:42:33.911 --> 02:42:35.788
Why? Tell me why!

02:42:35.955 --> 02:42:40.051
- To destroy the first-born of Israel.
- Oh, God!

02:42:40.876 --> 02:42:42.423
My God!

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:45.635
Out of his own mouth
comes thy judgment!

02:42:45.798 --> 02:42:48.972
- But I have saved your son, Moses.
- It is not my son who will die!

02:42:49.134 --> 02:42:51.228
It is... It is the first-born of Egypt!

02:42:51.387 --> 02:42:53.685
It is your son, Nefretiri!

02:42:56.016 --> 02:42:59.065
You would not dare
strike Pharaoh's son!

02:42:59.228 --> 02:43:01.731
In the hardness of his heart,
Pharaoh has mocked God

02:43:01.897 --> 02:43:04.150
and brings death to his own son!

02:43:04.316 --> 02:43:07.570
But he's my son, Moses.

02:43:07.736 --> 02:43:10.831
You would not harm my son?

02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:12.742
By myself, I am nothing.

02:43:12.908 --> 02:43:16.708
It is the power of God
which uses me to work his will.

02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:19.965
You would not let him do this to me.

02:43:20.124 --> 02:43:22.377
I saved your son.

02:43:22.543 --> 02:43:24.796
I cannot save yours.

02:43:24.962 --> 02:43:27.465
Your god listens to you, Moses.

02:43:28.882 --> 02:43:31.305
About midnight,

02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:35.223
the destroyer will come
into the midst of Egypt

02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:37.437
and all the first-born shall die,

02:43:37.599 --> 02:43:41.729
from the first-born of Pharaoh
to the first-born of his servants.

02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:46.074
When you were Prince of Egypt,

02:43:46.233 --> 02:43:48.827
you held me in your arms.

02:43:48.986 --> 02:43:50.704
When you were a condemned slave,

02:43:50.863 --> 02:43:55.118
I threw myself at your feet
before the court of Pharaoh.

02:43:55.284 --> 02:43:57.286
Because I loved you, Moses.

02:43:57.453 --> 02:44:01.299
It is the Lord
who executes judgment, Nefretiri.

02:44:03.625 --> 02:44:05.627
Go back to your son.

02:44:10.883 --> 02:44:14.558
Your love for me is stronger
than the power of any god.

02:44:17.014 --> 02:44:19.767
You will not kill my son.

02:44:25.689 --> 02:44:28.989
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!

02:44:43.665 --> 02:44:46.885
Death cometh to me

02:44:47.878 --> 02:44:52.475
To set me free

02:44:52.633 --> 02:44:57.355
Death cometh to me...

02:44:57.513 --> 02:45:01.188
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.

02:45:04.436 --> 02:45:06.188
Joshua!

02:45:08.023 --> 02:45:11.072
Joshua, you risk your life
in coming here.

02:45:11.235 --> 02:45:14.705
- You are first-born.
- So are you.

02:45:16.198 --> 02:45:21.045
I bring lamb's blood to mark
the doorposts and lintel,

02:45:21.203 --> 02:45:23.547
that the Angel of Death
may pass you by.

02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:28.010
Joshua, it is enough
that you have come to me.

02:45:29.086 --> 02:45:31.680
I am outcast among our people-

02:45:32.631 --> 02:45:36.181
Don't save me from death, Joshua,
save me from life.

02:45:36.343 --> 02:45:39.187
Tomorrow will bring a new world
for us, Lilia.

02:45:39.346 --> 02:45:43.067
There will be no new world!
And no blood on this door!

02:45:43.225 --> 02:45:46.775
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God's promise!

02:45:46.937 --> 02:45:50.407
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.

02:45:50.566 --> 02:45:55.117
Remember, Joshua,
of her own free will she's mine.

02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:52.048
And under his wing shalt thou trust

02:46:55.005 --> 02:46:57.679
"Though we stand
in the shadow of death,

02:46:57.841 --> 02:47:00.765
the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one."

02:47:00.928 --> 02:47:03.727
"The Lord is our God.
The Lord is one."

02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:09.361
His truth shall be thy shield

02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:13.491
"Shield us through this night
of terror, O King of the Universe."

02:47:18.153 --> 02:47:19.905
Why is everyone afraid?

02:47:20.072 --> 02:47:23.542
Why is this night
different from all others?

02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:26.829
Because this night the Lord our God

02:47:26.995 --> 02:47:29.589
will deliver us
from the bondage of Egypt.

02:47:29.748 --> 02:47:33.719
Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:35.424
Stand all!

02:47:37.923 --> 02:47:41.518
- Pharaoh's soldiers!
- Or worse!

02:47:46.515 --> 02:47:50.270
Or from the arrow that flyeth by day

02:47:54.064 --> 02:47:55.987
Bithiah!

02:47:56.149 --> 02:47:59.824
In fear of your god,
they have set me free.

02:47:59.987 --> 02:48:02.035
May a stranger enter?

02:48:04.449 --> 02:48:08.579
There are no strangers
among those who seek God's mercy.

02:48:09.746 --> 02:48:11.669
My bearers?

02:48:11.832 --> 02:48:14.881
All who thirst for freedom
may come with us.

02:48:18.255 --> 02:48:21.350
The darkness of death
will pass over us tonight.

02:48:21.508 --> 02:48:24.261
Tomorrow the light of freedom
will shine upon us

02:48:24.428 --> 02:48:28.353
- as we go forth from Egypt.
- I shall go with you, Moses.

02:48:28.515 --> 02:48:31.769
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!

02:48:31.935 --> 02:48:35.690
- The gods of Egypt.
- An idol-worshipper!

02:48:35.856 --> 02:48:38.325
This woman drew me from the Nile

02:48:38.483 --> 02:48:42.533
and set my feet
upon the path of knowledge.

02:48:42.696 --> 02:48:47.418
Mered, bring a chair to our table
for the daughter of Pharaoh.

02:48:47.576 --> 02:48:51.376
There is a great light
that shines from your face, Moses.

02:48:51.538 --> 02:48:53.916
Perhaps some day
I shall come to understand it.

02:48:54.082 --> 02:48:56.585
He is God's messenger, Princess.

02:50:04.027 --> 02:50:07.497
If it is not forbidden to look upon
the breath of pestilence,

02:50:07.656 --> 02:50:10.910
then see, for it is here.

02:50:12.119 --> 02:50:14.622
Do not look, Eleazar.

02:50:14.788 --> 02:50:18.918
Close the door, Joshua,
and let death pass.

02:50:27.008 --> 02:50:30.433
Will it pass, Moses? Will it pass?

02:50:30.595 --> 02:50:33.269
That is God's promise, Elisheba.

02:50:40.147 --> 02:50:43.117
"Blessed art thou, O Lord our God,

02:50:43.275 --> 02:50:46.199
who bringeth forth bread
from the Earth."

02:50:52.993 --> 02:50:55.416
Run! Run!

02:50:55.579 --> 02:50:59.049
There shall no evil befall you,

02:50:59.207 --> 02:51:01.426
or any plagues come near you.

02:51:01.585 --> 02:51:04.429
A thousand shall fall at thy sight

02:51:04.588 --> 02:51:07.888
Why do we eat unleavened bread
and bitter herbs, my uncle?

02:51:08.049 --> 02:51:12.555
- The herbs...
- Faster! Take the other road!

02:51:16.558 --> 02:51:20.938
The herbs remind us of the
bitterness of our captivity, Eleazar.

02:51:21.104 --> 02:51:24.984
But it shall not come nigh thee

02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:27.323
This is the bread of haste,

02:51:27.486 --> 02:51:29.454
that you will remember this night

02:51:29.613 --> 02:51:33.038
from generation to generation forever.

02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:36.579
Oh, my baby! Give me back my baby!

02:51:36.745 --> 02:51:41.751
- They are my people.
- All are God's people.

02:51:45.504 --> 02:51:48.098
Death is all around us!

02:51:48.256 --> 02:51:51.681
But it passes those
who have believed the Lord.

02:51:53.011 --> 02:51:56.015
Always remember, Eleazar,

02:51:56.181 --> 02:51:58.809
he passed over your house.

02:52:06.608 --> 02:52:09.953
Are the captains of Egypt
afraid of a night mist?

02:52:10.111 --> 02:52:14.958
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil's curse! Look!

02:52:33.385 --> 02:52:36.184
I've known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh,

02:52:36.346 --> 02:52:38.644
but I've not known fear till tonight.

02:52:38.807 --> 02:52:40.730
Aide.

02:52:43.061 --> 02:52:45.359
Have the captains join their men.

02:52:46.314 --> 02:52:49.158
At the coming of dawn, we will strike.

02:52:49.985 --> 02:52:52.909
No first-born Hebrew shall live.

02:53:06.376 --> 02:53:09.004
Let the Hebrews go, great one,

02:53:09.170 --> 02:53:11.593
or we are all dead men.

02:53:24.561 --> 02:53:26.279
He was your son?

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:29.358
My first-born.

02:53:51.963 --> 02:53:56.685
There is no magic cure,
no spell to use.

02:53:56.843 --> 02:53:59.346
He is the first-born of Pharaoh.

02:53:59.512 --> 02:54:04.063
We have no skill
before this... pestilence.

02:54:08.647 --> 02:54:13.073
- My father.
- My son.

02:54:13.902 --> 02:54:16.701
Your own curse is on him.

02:54:16.863 --> 02:54:20.413
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.

02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:23.003
I would not let his people go

02:54:23.161 --> 02:54:26.756
because your serpent's tongue
hardened my heart.

02:54:27.916 --> 02:54:31.420
You only thought to keep Moses here.

02:54:31.586 --> 02:54:35.261
You cared nothing for my throne,

02:54:35.423 --> 02:54:37.517
or my son-

02:54:38.593 --> 02:54:41.187
I asked Moses for his life.

02:54:42.973 --> 02:54:45.852
The shadow of death is on his face.

02:54:46.017 --> 02:54:51.365
No... he will not die.

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.817
Captain.

02:54:54.734 --> 02:54:58.739
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.

02:54:58.905 --> 02:55:01.033
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.

02:55:02.450 --> 02:55:04.418
He's my only son.

02:55:41.322 --> 02:55:43.620
You have conquered, Moses.

02:55:45.201 --> 02:55:48.831
The foot of a slave
is on the neck of Egypt.

02:55:50.832 --> 02:55:53.802
You were saved from the Nile
to be a curse upon me.

02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:56.930
Your shadow fell
between me and my father,

02:55:57.088 --> 02:56:00.467
between me and my fame,

02:56:01.843 --> 02:56:04.096
between me and my queen.

02:56:04.262 --> 02:56:08.438
Your shadow now fills
all things with death.

02:56:09.559 --> 02:56:12.654
Go out from among us,
you and your people.

02:56:12.812 --> 02:56:14.439
I set you free.

02:56:14.606 --> 02:56:17.029
It is not by your word,

02:56:17.192 --> 02:56:20.116
nor by my hand
that we are free, Pharaoh.

02:56:21.237 --> 02:56:25.333
- The power of God has freed us.
- Enough of your words!

02:56:25.867 --> 02:56:29.542
Take your people, your cattle,
your god and your pestilence.

02:56:29.704 --> 02:56:33.129
Take what spoils
from Egypt you will, but go!

02:56:35.543 --> 02:56:38.797
O Lord God,

02:56:38.963 --> 02:56:41.842
with a strong hand thou dost

02:56:42.008 --> 02:56:44.727
bring us out of bitter bondage.

02:56:47.055 --> 02:56:50.434
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation,

02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.855
where every man shall reap
what he has sown

02:56:55.021 --> 02:56:58.571
and bow no knee except in prayer.

02:56:59.359 --> 02:57:03.239
We will go with our young
and with our old,

02:57:03.404 --> 02:57:07.204
with our sons
and with our daughters,

02:57:07.367 --> 02:57:11.747
with our flocks
and with our herds will we go,

02:57:11.913 --> 02:57:15.588
for I know that the Lord is great

02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:19.254
and that our Lord is above all gods.

02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:35.232
He's dead.

02:58:14.392 --> 02:58:17.145
Sokar,

02:58:17.312 --> 02:58:21.112
great lord of the lower world,

02:58:21.274 --> 02:58:26.201
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt,

02:58:26.362 --> 02:58:28.080
bow before you now.

02:58:28.239 --> 02:58:32.585
Show that you have power
above the god of Moses,

02:58:32.744 --> 02:58:36.624
and restore the life
he has taken from my son.

02:58:38.499 --> 02:58:42.003
Guide back his soul
across the lake of death

02:58:42.170 --> 02:58:45.174
to the place of living men,

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:49.186
and I will raise a temple to you
mightier than the pyramids.

02:58:49.344 --> 02:58:52.769
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...

02:59:14.827 --> 02:59:17.876
Arise, O Israel!

02:59:18.039 --> 02:59:21.043
Behold the dawn of freedom!

02:59:39.185 --> 02:59:44.066
And it came to pass,
after the stifling night of terror;

02:59:44.232 --> 02:59:48.237
came a day such
as the world had never seen.

02:59:48.403 --> 02:59:51.407
From east and west,
from north and south,

02:59:51.572 --> 02:59:55.167
they came with all they had,
driving their Hooks

02:59:55.326 --> 02:59:57.704
and their herds
and their camels before them.

02:59:57.870 --> 03:00:00.919
By tens, by hundreds, by thousands,

03:00:01.082 --> 03:00:05.053
unending streams
of man and beast and burden,

03:00:05.211 --> 03:00:07.760
and even very much cattle,

03:00:07.922 --> 03:00:10.175
poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes.

03:00:10.341 --> 03:00:15.268
Beneath the stone feet of
the four colossal images of Rameses,

03:00:15.430 --> 03:00:18.149
which their own .sweat
and blood and sinew

03:00:18.308 --> 03:00:20.686
had hewn from solid rock,

03:00:20.852 --> 03:00:25.449
a nation arose and freedom
was born into the world.

03:00:27.108 --> 03:00:29.782
Grandfather, have you got Rebecca?

03:00:29.944 --> 03:00:31.617
No, I haven't got Rebecca.

03:00:31.779 --> 03:00:34.658
Here's the kneading trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.

03:00:34.824 --> 03:00:36.451
This is a blessed day!

03:00:36.617 --> 03:00:39.211
- Where's Rebecca?
- Here's Rebecca!

03:00:39.370 --> 03:00:41.293
- Ben Caleb!
- Thank you!

03:00:41.456 --> 03:00:43.834
- Can we take the cattle?
- We're moving to the gates.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.343
Horn and hoof.

03:00:45.501 --> 03:00:47.720
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.

03:00:47.879 --> 03:00:50.849
Don't forget the oil for the lamps.

03:00:51.007 --> 03:00:52.554
Where are we going, Naomi?

03:00:52.717 --> 03:00:55.516
To some land flowing
with milk and honey!

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:58.101
I've never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?

03:00:58.264 --> 03:01:01.643
It's away from the whip! Freedom
will wet your throats in the desert.

03:01:01.809 --> 03:01:03.607
Fill your water skins.

03:01:05.271 --> 03:01:08.445
This is the governor's house!
You cannot enter.

03:01:08.608 --> 03:01:10.827
Out! Out, all of you!

03:01:11.778 --> 03:01:14.827
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.

03:01:14.989 --> 03:01:16.866
Then stone bleeds!

03:01:22.663 --> 03:01:26.167
- Harness the mules!
- Your stonecutter did this to me!

03:01:26.334 --> 03:01:30.089
All your gold cannot
wipe that mark from your door, Dathan,

03:01:30.254 --> 03:01:32.052
or from my heart.

03:01:32.215 --> 03:01:34.764
Just for that,
you'll walk all the way to...

03:01:36.010 --> 03:01:38.684
Where are we going?

03:01:38.846 --> 03:01:41.565
- Do you know where we're going?
- To hell, I hope!

03:01:44.685 --> 03:01:48.690
Like Dathan, they did not know
where they were going,

03:01:48.856 --> 03:01:52.827
and they cared no more
than the flocks and herds they drove.

03:01:53.653 --> 03:01:58.079
Now they used the brick yokes
to carry a very different burden.

03:01:59.033 --> 03:02:00.876
And there went forth among them

03:02:01.035 --> 03:02:03.959
planters of vineyards
and sowers of seeds,

03:02:04.122 --> 03:02:07.843
each hoping to sit
under his own vine and Hg tree.

03:02:08.876 --> 03:02:11.220
Out of this glorious chaos,

03:02:11.379 --> 03:02:15.225
it is Joshua
who brings order and purpose.

03:02:16.050 --> 03:02:18.678
Set the standard of each tribe
before all the people!

03:02:18.845 --> 03:02:22.691
Levites in the center, Judah to
the right, Hephron to the left. Go!

03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:23.896
Hallelujah!

03:02:24.058 --> 03:02:26.902
Watch where you're going!
Watch out, you ribbon-carrier!

03:02:27.061 --> 03:02:29.189
Keep your big feet out of my geese!

03:03:04.599 --> 03:03:08.479
His son Joseph

03:03:08.644 --> 03:03:14.367
Many colors was his coat

03:03:17.653 --> 03:03:21.453
Aaron and the elders carry
a shrouded body, Grandfather!

03:03:21.616 --> 03:03:25.120
They bear the bones of Joseph,
to rest in his own land.

03:03:30.166 --> 03:03:32.544
Nubians, Grandfather!

03:03:40.801 --> 03:03:44.897
- Here come treasure wagons!
- Spoils of Egypt.

03:03:45.056 --> 03:03:50.529
All who shared the toil
will share this gold! Here, boy!

03:03:50.686 --> 03:03:52.654
For the blind one!

03:03:52.813 --> 03:03:56.909
It's a little golden calf,
Grandfather, with horns!

03:03:57.068 --> 03:04:00.493
An idol. For idol-worshippers!

03:04:01.781 --> 03:04:03.533
Grandpa, fire-bearers!

03:04:06.827 --> 03:04:09.751
Plant your tires at night
beside the tribal standards,

03:04:09.914 --> 03:04:11.837
where all may
come to light their torches!

03:04:11.999 --> 03:04:16.095
- They'll be burning, Joshua!
- Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.

03:04:16.254 --> 03:04:18.006
Now, the cradle.

03:04:19.465 --> 03:04:20.512
Here, Miriam.

03:04:20.675 --> 03:04:22.143
Joshua!

03:04:23.511 --> 03:04:25.013
Joshua!

03:04:27.265 --> 03:04:29.688
I have wagons
for the midwives and physicians.

03:04:29.850 --> 03:04:32.524
- Where shall they be placed?
- Five thousand cubits, one...

03:04:32.687 --> 03:04:33.939
Where's your whip, Dathan?

03:04:34.105 --> 03:04:37.405
I'll pay you back every lash
you gave me, Dathan!

03:04:43.614 --> 03:04:46.288
Now, is this a day for us
to have hard feelings?

03:04:46.450 --> 03:04:47.622
I've felt your whip!

03:04:47.785 --> 03:04:50.914
- Yes, every day.
- Lilia is no slave, Dathan!

03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:53.208
You can carry your own carton.

03:04:53.916 --> 03:04:55.714
Let her ride!

03:04:57.003 --> 03:05:00.223
So, now, my brother,
we have new taskmasters.

03:05:00.381 --> 03:05:03.885
- We serve no masters now!
- Yes, but not for long.

03:05:04.844 --> 03:05:06.892
Here. Old woman.

03:05:08.222 --> 03:05:09.974
- That's it.
- Joshua!

03:05:10.141 --> 03:05:12.269
Make way for the governor!

03:05:19.525 --> 03:05:23.200
- You know who I am.
- I know who you were, Lord Governor.

03:05:23.362 --> 03:05:25.080
I go to serve the Pharaoh-

03:05:25.239 --> 03:05:28.413
Tell Rameses I'm coming
back to my house.

03:05:28.576 --> 03:05:32.297
That rabble may follow Moses
into the desert today,

03:05:33.205 --> 03:05:35.833
but when their eyes
are seared red by the sun,

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.753
when their cracked lips
bleed with thirst,

03:05:38.919 --> 03:05:41.217
when their stomachs cramp
with hunger,

03:05:41.380 --> 03:05:44.304
they will curse
the name of Moses and his god.

03:05:44.467 --> 03:05:49.143
Then I, Dathan, will lead them back
to Pharaoh and the brick pits.

03:05:56.312 --> 03:05:58.280
There are so many-

03:06:00.566 --> 03:06:02.239
So many.

03:06:04.737 --> 03:06:08.708
How shall I find thy road
through the wilderness, Lord?

03:06:10.242 --> 03:06:15.965
How shall I find water
in the desert for this multitude?

03:06:21.545 --> 03:06:25.641
Moses, the people are assembled.

03:06:27.885 --> 03:06:31.014
Then let us go forth
to the mountain of God,

03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:34.354
that he may write his commandments
in our minds

03:06:34.517 --> 03:06:36.940
and upon our hearts forever.

03:06:37.103 --> 03:06:40.403
We march, praising his mighty name!

03:06:41.649 --> 03:06:44.243
- What is the word, Joshua?
- The word is given!

03:06:44.402 --> 03:06:46.496
Let the trumpets sound!

03:06:53.828 --> 03:06:57.048
Hear, O Israel!

03:06:57.206 --> 03:06:59.174
Remember this day,

03:06:59.333 --> 03:07:04.635
when the strong hand of the Lord
leads you out of bondage!

03:07:04.797 --> 03:07:14.309
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!

03:07:56.849 --> 03:07:59.898
- Come on! Come on!
- Yes! Come on!

03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:01.357
Joshua!

03:08:01.520 --> 03:08:04.820
Four hundred years in bondage,
and today he won't move!

03:08:40.351 --> 03:08:43.446
The Lord is one!

03:08:43.604 --> 03:08:46.448
Praise to God!

03:08:46.607 --> 03:08:48.905
Thank thee, O Lord!

03:09:01.121 --> 03:09:03.123
My litter can carry him.

03:09:04.625 --> 03:09:07.754
I am poured out like water,

03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:09.718
my strength dried up

03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:13.305
into the dust... of death.

03:09:13.467 --> 03:09:16.437
We shall plant your fig tree
in the new land.

03:09:16.595 --> 03:09:18.472
Children shall eat of its fruit.

03:09:21.725 --> 03:09:24.148
Do you hear that?
Do you hear that?!

03:09:24.311 --> 03:09:26.655
You have a strong new son!

03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:54.346
And he brought forth the people
with joy and gladness.

03:09:54.508 --> 03:09:56.510
He bore them out of Egypt

03:09:56.677 --> 03:10:00.398
as an eagle bears its young
upon its wings.

03:10:01.223 --> 03:10:05.444
But again,
Pharaoh 's heart was hardened.

03:10:12.067 --> 03:10:15.196
How many more days and nights
will you pray?

03:10:16.363 --> 03:10:18.365
Does he hear you?

03:10:21.285 --> 03:10:23.788
Dread Lord of Darkness,

03:10:23.954 --> 03:10:27.174
are you not greater
than the god of Moses?

03:10:28.375 --> 03:10:32.050
I have raised my voice to you,
yet life

03:10:32.212 --> 03:10:34.840
has not come to the body of my son.

03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:40.646
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.

03:10:40.804 --> 03:10:44.104
He's nothing but a piece of stone
with the head of a bird.

03:10:44.266 --> 03:10:46.439
He will hear me.

03:10:49.021 --> 03:10:50.568
I am Egypt.

03:10:50.731 --> 03:10:53.075
Egypt?

03:10:53.233 --> 03:10:55.076
You are nothing.

03:10:56.278 --> 03:10:59.327
You let Moses kill my son.

03:10:59.490 --> 03:11:02.243
No god can bring him back.

03:11:04.078 --> 03:11:06.422
What have you done to Moses?

03:11:06.580 --> 03:11:08.833
How did he die?

03:11:09.708 --> 03:11:12.678
Did he cry for mercy
when you tortured him?

03:11:14.088 --> 03:11:15.556
Bring me to his body!

03:11:15.714 --> 03:11:18.763
I want to see it, Rameses!
I want to see it!

03:11:18.926 --> 03:11:20.928
This is my son.

03:11:23.097 --> 03:11:25.191
He would have been Pharaoh.

03:11:26.308 --> 03:11:28.606
He would have ruled the world.

03:11:29.603 --> 03:11:31.856
Who mourns him now?

03:11:32.022 --> 03:11:37.404
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.

03:11:38.821 --> 03:11:41.916
You will not see his body.

03:11:42.074 --> 03:11:44.497
I drove him out of Egypt.

03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:49.419
I cannot fight the power of his god.

03:11:50.874 --> 03:11:53.127
His god?

03:11:53.293 --> 03:11:56.797
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god,

03:11:56.964 --> 03:12:01.265
but you are not a god,
you are even less than a man.

03:12:02.928 --> 03:12:04.896
Listen to me, Rameses,

03:12:05.055 --> 03:12:10.437
you thought I was evil when I went
to Moses, and you were right.

03:12:10.602 --> 03:12:13.105
Shall I tell you what happened,
Rameses?

03:12:14.273 --> 03:12:18.449
He spurned me,
like a strumpet in the street.

03:12:18.610 --> 03:12:23.036
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!

03:12:23.907 --> 03:12:27.957
All that you wanted from me
he would not even take.

03:12:31.498 --> 03:12:34.001
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?

03:12:35.669 --> 03:12:37.763
Not the laughter of kings,

03:12:37.921 --> 03:12:40.674
but the laughter of slaves
on the desert!

03:12:44.053 --> 03:12:45.805
Laughter?

03:12:48.057 --> 03:12:49.684
Laughter?

03:12:53.979 --> 03:12:58.200
My son, I shall build your tomb
upon their crushed bodies!

03:12:58.358 --> 03:13:02.704
If any escape me, their seed shall
be scattered and accursed forever!

03:13:02.863 --> 03:13:05.707
My armor. War crown.

03:13:05.866 --> 03:13:07.709
Laughter?

03:13:07.868 --> 03:13:12.590
I will turn the laughter of these
slaves into wails of torment!

03:13:12.748 --> 03:13:15.843
They shall remember the name of Moses,

03:13:16.001 --> 03:13:19.221
only that he died
under my chariot wheels!

03:13:21.215 --> 03:13:23.889
Kill him with your own hands.

03:13:24.051 --> 03:13:27.772
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.

03:13:27.930 --> 03:13:29.603
Assemble all the chariots
at the city gate.

03:13:29.765 --> 03:13:32.985
- I obey!
- Nura and Thebes will draw my chariot.

03:13:33.143 --> 03:13:36.067
I will bring you back
your temple treasure!

03:14:08.303 --> 03:14:12.979
Bring it back to me
stained with his blood.

03:14:13.142 --> 03:14:14.735
I will.

03:14:17.187 --> 03:14:19.610
To mingle with your own!

03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:10.991
Nura, Thebes!

03:15:15.579 --> 03:15:17.752
Guards salute!

03:15:18.624 --> 03:15:20.342
Hail!

03:15:25.714 --> 03:15:27.887
Hail!

03:15:29.051 --> 03:15:31.270
Remember your first-born!

03:15:32.512 --> 03:15:36.358
- Death to the slaves!
- Death to the slaves!

03:15:36.516 --> 03:15:40.271
- Death to their god!
- Death to their god!

03:15:40.437 --> 03:15:42.189
Hail!

03:15:42.356 --> 03:15:44.074
Forward!

03:16:40.706 --> 03:16:43.926
Do you hear thunder? Over the sea?

03:16:45.294 --> 03:16:47.092
No, it comes from the desert.

03:16:47.254 --> 03:16:49.632
That's the thunder of horses!

03:16:49.798 --> 03:16:52.972
Look! Pharaoh's chariot!

03:16:57.180 --> 03:17:01.105
We're trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!

03:17:07.441 --> 03:17:08.943
Joshua?

03:17:14.197 --> 03:17:15.870
That's Joshua's horn!

03:17:16.033 --> 03:17:20.504
All men to the pass!
Get carts, wagons! Form a barrier!

03:17:22.164 --> 03:17:24.132
- What's the alarm, Joshua?
- Pharaoh's chariot!

03:17:24.291 --> 03:17:28.091
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!

03:17:28.628 --> 03:17:32.883
- Bring shovels, pounders, mattocks!
- Hear me! Hear me!

03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:35.223
Can mattocks stop arrows?

03:17:35.385 --> 03:17:38.059
Will your little carts
stop Pharaoh's Chariots?

03:17:38.221 --> 03:17:40.223
You women,
do you want to see your men killed?

03:17:40.390 --> 03:17:42.484
- Moses!
- Joshua, what is it?

03:17:42.642 --> 03:17:45.646
Pharaoh's chariots!
I've ordered men to block the pass!

03:17:45.812 --> 03:17:48.361
- How can we fight chariots?
- Nothing can stop them!

03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:50.867
Order the men to move back, Joshua.

03:17:51.026 --> 03:17:53.700
Move back? Where? Into the sea?

03:17:53.862 --> 03:17:55.580
Into the hand of God.

03:17:55.739 --> 03:17:59.209
Deliverer?
Yes, he has delivered you to death!

03:18:00.744 --> 03:18:02.746
Run! Run!

03:18:02.913 --> 03:18:05.382
Look! Look!

03:18:07.501 --> 03:18:11.347
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!

03:18:11.505 --> 03:18:13.678
Stone him! Stone him!

03:18:24.768 --> 03:18:28.022
The god of Moses is a poor general,

03:18:28.188 --> 03:18:29.781
to leave him no retreat.

03:18:36.154 --> 03:18:40.500
Ten times you have seen
the miracles of the Lord!

03:18:40.659 --> 03:18:43.208
And still you have no faith!

03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:46.214
He's a false prophet
who delivers you to death!

03:18:46.373 --> 03:18:48.467
Stone him! Stone him!

03:18:50.961 --> 03:18:54.556
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God's will!

03:18:54.714 --> 03:18:56.216
Forward!

03:19:02.514 --> 03:19:06.485
- They will stop for me!
- A charging chariot knows no rank.

03:19:11.523 --> 03:19:13.571
Was it because
there were no graves in Egypt

03:19:13.733 --> 03:19:15.906
that you took us away
to die in the wilderness?

03:19:16.069 --> 03:19:17.537
Why must we die?

03:19:18.905 --> 03:19:20.873
Fear not!

03:19:21.032 --> 03:19:26.163
Stand still,
and see the salvation of the Lord!

03:19:36.047 --> 03:19:39.768
- A pillar of fire!
- It is the work of God!

03:19:51.688 --> 03:19:53.315
Through it!

03:19:55.275 --> 03:19:58.905
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!

03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:12.300
Gather your families and your flocks.
We must go with all speed.

03:20:12.459 --> 03:20:15.633
Go where? To drown in the sea?

03:20:15.795 --> 03:20:17.843
How long will the fire
hold Pharaoh back?

03:20:18.006 --> 03:20:20.134
- Will it hold?
- After this day,

03:20:20.300 --> 03:20:22.519
you shall see his Chariots no more!

03:20:22.677 --> 03:20:25.806
No! You'll be dead under them!

03:20:27.140 --> 03:20:30.986
The Lord of Hosts
will do battle for us!

03:20:34.606 --> 03:20:37.826
Behold his mighty hand!

03:21:09.140 --> 03:21:11.313
The wind opens the sea!

03:21:11.476 --> 03:21:15.197
God opens the sea
with the blast of his nostrils.

03:21:19.985 --> 03:21:22.738
Lead them through
the midst of the waters.

03:21:22.904 --> 03:21:24.702
His will be done!

03:21:27.492 --> 03:21:32.248
He opens the waters before them,
and he bars our way with fire.

03:21:32.414 --> 03:21:35.588
Let us go from this place.
Men cannot fight against a god!

03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:38.549
Better to die in battle with a god,
than live in shame.

03:21:38.712 --> 03:21:41.181
Praise God and down into it!

03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:26.219
God has delivered us
from the son of Pharaohs.

03:22:26.384 --> 03:22:28.978
Jacob cherished

03:22:29.137 --> 03:22:32.607
His son Joseph

03:22:32.766 --> 03:22:37.112
Many colors was his coat

03:22:38.146 --> 03:22:40.695
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!

03:22:47.822 --> 03:22:50.450
Pull! Pull for your lives!

03:22:50.617 --> 03:22:52.870
Is your life worth so much?

03:22:58.124 --> 03:23:00.673
Jacob cherished

03:23:00.835 --> 03:23:04.214
His son Joseph

03:23:04.381 --> 03:23:09.638
Many colors was his coat

03:23:11.513 --> 03:23:15.108
God of A 'Dram

03:23:15.266 --> 03:23:18.645
Isaac, Jacob

03:23:18.812 --> 03:23:24.444
Ever bless us with Thy hand

03:23:41.084 --> 03:23:43.837
Get tow-lines on the midwife's cart!

03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:50.769
Save the bread if you can!

03:23:50.927 --> 03:23:55.478
Ben Caleb! Order all wagons
to turn clear!

03:24:00.895 --> 03:24:05.275
Moses! Stand on the rock where
the people can see you and have hope!

03:24:05.442 --> 03:24:07.240
Above us!

03:24:07.402 --> 03:24:09.029
Help that wagon!

03:24:30.300 --> 03:24:32.018
The fire dies!

03:24:34.721 --> 03:24:36.439
Sound the pursuit!

03:24:50.361 --> 03:24:52.489
Chariots, halt!

03:24:56.409 --> 03:24:59.538
This is work for a butcher,
not a Pharaoh.

03:25:00.580 --> 03:25:02.298
Destroy them all.

03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:05.085
But bring Moses to me alive.

03:25:05.251 --> 03:25:09.427
Level spears! Forward!

03:25:43.206 --> 03:25:46.961
- Here! Take him!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

03:26:05.478 --> 03:26:07.731
Grandfather, look,
the horses are coming!

03:26:07.897 --> 03:26:11.697
The chariots! Run! Run!
Run for your lives!

03:26:22.996 --> 03:26:25.670
Better to serve the Egyptians
than to die here!

03:26:25.832 --> 03:26:29.632
Who shall withstand the power of God?

03:27:22.555 --> 03:27:26.105
Thou didst blow with Thy winds,

03:27:27.018 --> 03:27:29.521
and the sea covered them!

03:27:31.356 --> 03:27:34.235
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?

03:27:35.109 --> 03:27:38.409
From everlasting to everlasting,

03:27:39.322 --> 03:27:41.416
Thou art God!

03:27:41.574 --> 03:27:46.580
The Lord is one! The Lord is one!

03:28:28.454 --> 03:28:31.003
Before you strike,

03:28:31.165 --> 03:28:34.294
show me his blood on your sword.

03:28:46.556 --> 03:28:49.730
You couldn't even kill him.

03:28:51.394 --> 03:28:55.820
His god... is God.

03:29:06.367 --> 03:29:09.496
And Moses led Israel
from the Red Sea

03:29:09.662 --> 03:29:12.415
into the wilderness of Sinai.

03:29:12.582 --> 03:29:15.586
And they camped
before the holy mountain.

03:29:15.752 --> 03:29:18.471
And when the people saw
that Moses delayed

03:29:18.629 --> 03:29:21.132
to come down out of the mountain,

03:29:21.299 --> 03:29:23.848
they gathered themselves together.

03:29:24.677 --> 03:29:29.353
Ask Aaron. Could anyone live on that
fiery summit for 40 days and 40 nights?

03:29:29.515 --> 03:29:34.112
- Yes! By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?

03:29:35.021 --> 03:29:38.025
Do you? Do I?

03:29:38.691 --> 03:29:41.865
Or you, Sephora? His grieving wife.

03:29:42.028 --> 03:29:44.122
She came back among us
to find her husband.

03:29:44.280 --> 03:29:48.001
But he's dead.
Even she cannot hope that he lives!

03:29:48.159 --> 03:29:52.460
Moses went up into the forbidden
ground to receive God's law!

03:29:52.622 --> 03:29:55.250
Yes, but he's not returned!

03:29:55.416 --> 03:29:59.466
We share your pain. We sympathize.

03:29:59.629 --> 03:30:02.974
But will sympathy lead us to this
land flowing with milk and honey?

03:30:03.132 --> 03:30:06.227
- Now, we have no leader!
- Don't be fooled!

03:30:06.385 --> 03:30:08.808
Moses will return!

03:30:10.181 --> 03:30:13.060
Would a God
who's shown you such wonders

03:30:13.226 --> 03:30:15.820
let Moses die
before his work is done?

03:30:15.978 --> 03:30:18.697
- His work is done.
- His mother!

03:30:18.856 --> 03:30:22.281
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!

03:30:22.443 --> 03:30:25.287
But there are other mothers among you!

03:30:25.446 --> 03:30:27.744
What will become of your children?

03:30:29.408 --> 03:30:33.083
- We must have faith!
- Faith in what? You, Aaron?

03:30:33.913 --> 03:30:37.588
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
Do you know where it is?

03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:38.922
- Tell us!
- Where is it?

03:30:39.085 --> 03:30:40.257
Across the wilderness!

03:30:40.419 --> 03:30:43.172
- Then who is to lead us?
- You, Dathan!

03:30:46.843 --> 03:30:49.187
Where could I bring you,
except to Egypt?

03:30:49.345 --> 03:30:52.440
- Where there is death?
- No! Where there is food!

03:30:52.598 --> 03:30:56.853
- Pharaoh would kill us all.
- Not if a god of Egypt went before us!

03:30:57.019 --> 03:30:58.441
- You could make one for us, Aaron.
- No.

03:30:58.604 --> 03:31:00.447
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!

03:31:00.606 --> 03:31:02.608
I will not!

03:31:03.526 --> 03:31:05.324
He will not!

03:31:05.486 --> 03:31:08.615
He would rather see our flesh rot
in the wilderness.

03:31:09.699 --> 03:31:12.168
You will make a god for us!

03:31:12.326 --> 03:31:15.921
A god of gold! A golden calf!

03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:21.628
Korah shall be the high priest!

03:31:23.921 --> 03:31:28.142
Bring baskets! Buckets! Shawls!
Anything you have!

03:31:28.301 --> 03:31:32.727
Break off your earrings,
your bracelets, your necklaces!

03:31:32.889 --> 03:31:35.642
We will make of them a golden calf!

03:31:36.893 --> 03:31:40.818
- The golden spoils we took from Egypt!
- There!

03:31:52.491 --> 03:31:54.493
Spoils of Egypt!

03:32:06.464 --> 03:32:08.683
From the burning bush, O Lord,

03:32:08.841 --> 03:32:12.891
you charged me to bring the people
to this holy mountain,

03:32:13.054 --> 03:32:16.479
to behold your glory
and receive your law.

03:32:17.225 --> 03:32:19.728
What have I left undone?

03:32:27.485 --> 03:32:29.579
Lam...

03:32:31.697 --> 03:32:34.075
lam...

03:32:35.576 --> 03:32:39.501
I am the Lord thy God.

03:32:39.664 --> 03:32:44.340
Thou shalt have
no other gods before me.

03:32:49.090 --> 03:32:54.312
Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image.

03:33:06.399 --> 03:33:10.404
And they overlaid the image
with pure gold.

03:33:10.569 --> 03:33:14.745
And Aaron fashioned it
and smoothed it with the hammer;

03:33:14.907 --> 03:33:20.414
ready to be graven
by cunning art and man's device.

03:33:20.579 --> 03:33:24.584
And he fastened it with nails
that it should not move.

03:33:25.710 --> 03:33:28.213
And he that smote the anvil

03:33:28.379 --> 03:33:32.179
did beat the molten gold
into thin plates.

03:33:32.341 --> 03:33:36.346
For they had gathered their treasure
into the midst of the furnace,

03:33:36.512 --> 03:33:39.607
and did blow the fire upon it
to melt it.

03:33:41.100 --> 03:33:45.606
And they adorned themselves
in rich apparel and costly array,

03:33:45.771 --> 03:33:49.116
with veils of blue
and purple and scarlet,

03:33:49.275 --> 03:33:52.620
and fine twined linen wrought in Egypt.

03:33:52.778 --> 03:33:57.454
And the women tread grapes
from Midian into new wine.

03:33:57.616 --> 03:34:00.244
Thou shall not take the name

03:34:00.411 --> 03:34:04.541
of the Lord thy God in vain.

03:34:08.085 --> 03:34:13.091
Remember the Sabbath day,
to keep it holy.

03:34:17.803 --> 03:34:22.104
Honor thy father and thy mother:

03:34:27.646 --> 03:34:30.570
Thou shalt not kill.

03:34:43.496 --> 03:34:45.624
And the people sinned a great sin,

03:34:46.749 --> 03:34:49.878
for they had made them a god of gold.

03:34:50.044 --> 03:34:53.719
And they bore him upon their
shoulders and rejoiced,

03:34:53.881 --> 03:34:57.511
saying, "This be our god, O Israel. "

03:34:57.676 --> 03:35:01.931
Are you mourners of Moses
afraid to face the new god of gold?

03:35:02.098 --> 03:35:05.693
They were as children
who had lost their faith.

03:35:05.851 --> 03:35:11.233
They were perverse and crooked
and rebellious against God.

03:35:11.399 --> 03:35:13.868
They did eat the bread of wickedness,

03:35:14.026 --> 03:35:16.495
and drank the wine of violence,

03:35:16.654 --> 03:35:19.783
and they did evil
in the eyes of the Lord.

03:35:19.949 --> 03:35:24.455
And the people cried,
"The graven image hath brought us joy, ”

03:35:24.620 --> 03:35:29.626
and they worshipped the golden calf
and sacrificed unto it.

03:35:30.167 --> 03:35:32.841
Here is your sacrifice!

03:35:37.508 --> 03:35:41.012
Make way!
Make way for the sacrifice!

03:36:25.556 --> 03:36:29.356
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

03:36:35.524 --> 03:36:38.778
Thou shalt not steal.

03:36:43.115 --> 03:36:46.870
Thou shalt not bear false witness

03:36:47.036 --> 03:36:49.459
against thy neighbor:

03:36:52.708 --> 03:36:56.554
Thou shalt not covet anything

03:36:56.712 --> 03:36:58.840
that is thy neighbor's.

03:37:26.617 --> 03:37:30.167
Written with the finger of God.

03:37:40.005 --> 03:37:43.760
Go! Get thee down,

03:37:43.926 --> 03:37:48.352
for thy people
have corrupted themselves.

03:38:07.575 --> 03:38:10.169
And the people rose up to play,

03:38:10.327 --> 03:38:12.421
and did eat and drink.

03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:15.049
They were as the children of fools

03:38:15.207 --> 03:38:17.380
and cast off their clothes.

03:38:17.543 --> 03:38:19.921
The wicked were like a troubled sea

03:38:20.087 --> 03:38:23.261
whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

03:38:23.424 --> 03:38:25.677
They sank from evil to evil

03:38:25.843 --> 03:38:28.096
and were viler than the earth.

03:38:28.262 --> 03:38:30.731
And there was rioting and drunkenness,

03:38:30.889 --> 03:38:33.358
for they had become servants of sin.

03:38:33.517 --> 03:38:38.774
There was manifest all manner of
ungodliness and works of the flesh.

03:38:38.939 --> 03:38:41.943
Even adultery and lasciviousness,

03:38:42.109 --> 03:38:45.363
uncleanness, idolatry and rioting,

03:38:45.529 --> 03:38:47.156
vanity and wrath.

03:38:47.323 --> 03:38:51.920
And they were filled
with iniquity and vile affections.

03:38:52.077 --> 03:38:56.423
And Aaron knew
that he had brought them to shame.

03:39:00.252 --> 03:39:04.507
Abiram! Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!

03:39:04.673 --> 03:39:07.222
Even unto the horns of the altar!

03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:40.084
The light of God
shines from you, Moses.

03:39:41.126 --> 03:39:44.300
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.

03:39:44.463 --> 03:39:47.307
These tablets of stone...

03:39:47.466 --> 03:39:49.309
The writing of God.

03:39:50.678 --> 03:39:53.056
His Ten Commandments.

03:39:58.227 --> 03:40:01.197
There is a noise of war in the camp.

03:40:01.355 --> 03:40:04.154
It is not the noise of war.

03:40:04.316 --> 03:40:07.286
It is the noise of song and revelry.

03:40:39.685 --> 03:40:42.529
- Moses!
- Look!

03:40:43.856 --> 03:40:44.903
Joshua!

03:40:45.524 --> 03:40:48.994
Woe unto thee, O Israel.

03:40:49.153 --> 03:40:53.374
You have sinned a great sin
in the sight of God!

03:40:54.283 --> 03:40:59.005
You are not worthy
to receive these Ten Commandments.

03:40:59.163 --> 03:41:00.210
Aaron!

03:41:10.340 --> 03:41:12.718
We are gathered against you, Moses!

03:41:12.885 --> 03:41:15.729
You take too much upon yourself!

03:41:15.888 --> 03:41:19.233
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!

03:41:19.391 --> 03:41:22.895
There is no freedom without the law.

03:41:23.061 --> 03:41:25.029
Whose law, Moses? Yours?

03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:28.614
Did you carve those tablets
to become a prince over us?

03:41:30.444 --> 03:41:33.994
Who is on the Lord's side,

03:41:34.156 --> 03:41:38.036
- let him come to me!
-I am!

03:41:45.417 --> 03:41:47.590
Moses!

03:41:49.797 --> 03:41:52.641
- You have cursed us.
- Dathan and the people made me do it.

03:41:54.676 --> 03:41:58.397
Joshua! Joshua!

03:42:03.393 --> 03:42:08.069
He showed you no land flowing with milk
and honey! I show you a god of gold!

03:42:08.232 --> 03:42:10.234
Come with me! Follow me!

03:42:10.400 --> 03:42:13.404
Blasphemers! Idolaters!

03:42:13.570 --> 03:42:18.121
For this you shall drink bitter waters!

03:42:18.867 --> 03:42:21.620
God has set before you this day

03:42:21.787 --> 03:42:25.462
his laws of life and good

03:42:25.624 --> 03:42:28.753
and death and evil.

03:42:30.087 --> 03:42:33.967
Those who will not live by the law...

03:42:35.425 --> 03:42:38.429
...shall die by the law!

03:43:05.998 --> 03:43:09.502
And the Lord's anger
was kindled against Israel.

03:43:09.668 --> 03:43:13.343
And to prove whether they
would keep his commandments or no,

03:43:13.505 --> 03:43:18.477
he made them wander
in the wilderness 40 years,

03:43:18.635 --> 03:43:22.685
until all the generation that had done
evil in the sight of the Lord

03:43:22.848 --> 03:43:25.351
was consumed.

03:43:25.517 --> 03:43:30.694
But Moses' eye was not dim,
nor his natural force abated.

03:43:31.523 --> 03:43:35.448
And he went up from the plains
of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,

03:43:35.611 --> 03:43:38.114
and the Lord showed him all the land

03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:42.035
that was beyond the river Jordan.

03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:43.747
The Lord was angry with me

03:43:43.911 --> 03:43:47.711
because I disobeyed him
by the waters of strife.

03:43:47.873 --> 03:43:52.549
And he said unto me,
"Behold the new land with thine eyes.

03:43:52.711 --> 03:43:56.636
For thou shalt not cross
over this river Jordan."

03:43:56.798 --> 03:43:59.176
Then I shall stay.

03:43:59.343 --> 03:44:04.144
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.

03:44:04.306 --> 03:44:06.308
Look, Moses.

03:44:06.475 --> 03:44:09.354
The people have come
to the river Jordan.

03:44:10.896 --> 03:44:14.275
In the Ark, they carry
the law you brought them.

03:44:15.275 --> 03:44:19.075
You taught them
not to live by bread alone.

03:44:19.237 --> 03:44:24.084
You are God's torch,
that lights the way to freedom.

03:44:26.745 --> 03:44:28.463
I love you.

03:44:32.459 --> 03:44:34.006
Joshua...

03:44:45.222 --> 03:44:49.443
Joshua,
I charge you and strengthen you,

03:44:49.601 --> 03:44:53.401
for you shall go over Jordan
to lead the people.

03:44:55.691 --> 03:44:59.741
As for me and my house,
we shall serve the Lord.

03:45:01.488 --> 03:45:04.617
Mered, give me the books.

03:45:05.784 --> 03:45:10.756
Eleazar, set these five books

03:45:10.914 --> 03:45:12.461
in the Ark of the Covenant,

03:45:12.624 --> 03:45:15.218
by the tablets
of the Ten Commandments,

03:45:15.377 --> 03:45:18.130
which the Lord restored unto us.

03:45:32.310 --> 03:45:34.153
Go.

03:45:34.312 --> 03:45:37.691
Proclaim liberty
throughout all the lands,

03:45:37.858 --> 03:45:41.158
unto all the inhabitants thereof.
