WEBVTT

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.541
Hey, I'm sitting here!

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:39.250
This won't work.
It's got to be Digital India.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:52.333
There's a spot.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.875
Turn off those headlights!
I'm taking a dump here!

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:03.500
Grab him!
He's shitting in the woods!

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.708
-You can't teach an old dog new tricks!
-What do you care where I poop?

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.333
-Just come with us!
-Let go!

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.208
-Get in the truck.
-Let me go!

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:12.166
-Let me go!
-Get in!

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:15.000
Marudu, round them up.
Don't spare anyone.

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:17.333
There is someone over there
as well. Get him!

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.458
-Hey! Where are you taking me?
-Come on!

00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.500
-But I'm not done!
-That's enough.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:23.250
Trotting about with mugs!

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.000
Get down, all of you!

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:40.666
Get down, everyone.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.208
-Go and stand with those men.
-Get down!

00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:44.458
-Hurry up!
-Get down!

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:45.833
Get down.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.833
Join them!

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:52.875
CLEAN INDIA CAMPAIGN
PUBLIC TOILET - SOORANGUDI

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.000
It's the first ever toilet in Soorangudi!
In North Soorangudi, no less.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.250
What do you think?

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.416
THE MAGNANIMOUS BUILDER OF TOILETS!

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.208
Greetings, sir!

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:24.541
-Is everyone here?
-Yes.

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:26.458
Hey, turn that off!

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.916
We are opening a toilet
in North Soorangudi.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:34.250
I thought the Northerners would throng
to celebrate our community's might.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.083
But you went to
do your business in the bushes!

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:39.375
One toilet for an entire village
to shit in? That's great!

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:41.583
Sudalai, cut the crap!

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:42.958
This is not just about shitting.

00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:46.125
We will lose our pride if the leader
finds out that you shat in the bushes.

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.875
It's not about shitting.
It's a matter of pride.

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.458
You can shit later.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:53.041
Hey, turn off the damn music!

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.333
Here come the Southerners!

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:14.500
Now, I'll have to hold it in forever.

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.083
Come here, hold it

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:24.333
Lift it.

00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:27.166
Place it there. Higher.

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.791
Fasten it at that end.

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:34.166
THE PRINCE OF SOORANGUDI!

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.583
Come on, let's go

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:54.000
Mate, this is not even
a western water closet.

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:57.625
All this fuss for an Indian toilet!

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:58.833
Why are you here?

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.791
To offer our prayers.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:02.083
Why would one come to a toilet?

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:04.333
Why would you bring
a crowbar to the toilet?

00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:08.666
Mathi, the leader has
built this toilet for our people.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.000
Your people can't be here.

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.875
-Leave before he arrives.
-What?

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:14.458
Only for your people?
What's written up there?

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.166
"Soorangudi Public Toilet."

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.875
Doesn't public mean common for all?

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.500
Oh, you have finally
understood what public means!

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.875
When a new school was built in the
South, didn't you keep our kids out?

00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.833
Have you forgotten about that?

00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:28.708
It's not like you let that slide.

00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.541
You demolished the school overnight,
and ruined it for our kids as well.

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:34.166
Enough of that rubbish!

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:36.833
This toilet is in North Soorangudi,
which means it's only for us.

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:38.875
We will see!

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.666
Brother, they are here
just to provoke us.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.958
There's no point in talking to them.

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.750
Perhaps a few slaps
will make them scram!

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:47.000
Yeah, right.
I dare you to touch me.

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:48.666
Kaalai, put your slippers back on!

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.916
Be patient.

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:51.500
Let's wait for the leader.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.500
Let him decide who uses the toilet.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.291
Till then, nobody moves.
Go and find the leader.

00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.791
Well, then, we'll also wait here.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:59.458
This ends today.

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.333
Sit down, all of you.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.583
Nobody will leave
until the leader arrives.

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:05.291
-Sudalai, sit down.
-Sit.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.041
Devi?

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.583
Devi?

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:26.083
Valli?

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:28.833
Valli?

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:30.833
Is anyone home?

00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:41.666
Devi!

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.833
-What is it?
-There's a stain on my <i>veshti</i>.

00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:51.958
-I have to go to the opening ceremony.
-Right, the opening ceremony!

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:54.541
I'm supposed to be
the village president's wife.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.666
Had my son Rathinam been
granted the toilet contract,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.333
he would have made good money.

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.625
But you gave to it to
some random stranger.

00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:06.958
You better grant the road building
contracts to my son Rathinam!

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958
What about my son Mathi then?

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.458
My Southern folks tell me
that he works hard like you,

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.166
even though he is young.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.958
My son Mathi should be
given the road contracts.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.208
Despite being a follower of Periyar,

00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.750
why do I wear the colors
of two caste-based parties?

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:28.958
By remaining neutral,
I hope people would listen to me.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.958
If it weren't for me, they would
have beaten each other to death.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:36.333
The reason I married two women
from different communities…

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:38.833
is to avoid such conflicts.

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:41.958
I know they are both my sons.

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:45.541
But if I grant the contract to Rathinam,
the Southerners will get angry.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.041
And If the contract goes to Mathi,
the Northerners will storm into our house.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.416
I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place.

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:55.166
I don't care!
I want Mathi to get the road contract.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.000
Or else, I'll get my people
to stage a blockade.

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.541
Then you will have to lay
the roads over my dead body.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:02.000
He is only fond of his eldest!

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.000
If my son Rathinam doesn't get
the road building contract,

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:10.000
I will ensure that no good
ever happens to this village.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:14.250
Sir!

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.500
Sir!

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:21.666
Turn up the volume.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.541
Hey! Can't you drive slower?

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:37.500
Both your sons are
at the opening ceremony.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:40.666
If we don't hurry,
there could be a clash between them.

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:43.208
They will never learn.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.833
This ends today.
It's either us or them.

00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:47.041
The leader is here.

00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:48.916
Sir.

00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:50.291
Greetings, sir.

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.958
Won't you let anything good
happen in this village?

00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:55.250
That's not true, sir.

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:57.416
Public toilet is open to all, right?

00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:59.541
Is it fair to stop
the Southerners from using it?

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.875
It has been built in the North,
it's for the Northerners.

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.250
But the Southerners
are causing trouble!

00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:06.458
What's a toilet got to do with
North and South? It's a public toilet.

00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:08.458
But we only have one toilet.

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.416
I built just one hoping you both
would come together at least for this.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.041
Hand me the scissors.

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:22.500
Wonderful! The dog
inaugurated the toilet already!

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.208
That ribbon has gone to waste.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.250
Hey, go and clean it up.

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:30.791
-He's asking us to clean it up.
-Stay put, let them do it.

00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:33.291
Sir, our people
don't do such chores.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:36.875
It's your butthole that shits,
but you expect others to clean it?

00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.291
I'll clean it.

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:40.291
-Sir!
-Sir, how can you…

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:43.875
What do we do now?

00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:48.583
There is a way.

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:49.791
What?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.958
Murugesan, go and find Jackass.

00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:52.916
Who?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.291
Smile.

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.666
BARBER SHOP
SOORANGUDI

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:16.166
<i>-We are not kings who rule over countries</i>
<i>-We are not!</i>

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.166
<i>-Yet we are busy working with the crown</i>
<i>-The crown!</i>

<i>Even monarchs must hold their heads still</i>
<i>When we say the word…</i>

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:26.708
Hey, wake up!

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:28.083
Hey!

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:31.333
The leader has sent for Jackass.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.791
Smile!

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:44.833
Smile!

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.750
Wake up!

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:10.458
-What is it?
-The leader has called for you. Hurry up.

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:24.416
Hurry up!

00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:25.916
Come on.

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:35.916
Let's go.

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:38.583
Get down!

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.666
Don't you know your caste?

00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:49.416
Have you no shame?
How dare you get in the car?

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.416
You said it was urgent, so…

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.291
Does that mean
you get in the car as an equal?

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.125
-Just follow me!
-Okay.

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:59.875
These pests are forbidden from using front
doors and they want to ride in a car!

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:02.375
Come, let's go.

00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.666
If he didn't want us in the car,
then why did he bring the car?

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.333
Maybe he doesn't know
how to ride pillion. Keep going.

00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:18.416
How can you ride pillion in a car?

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.541
He's here.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:30.541
Greetings, sir.

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:36.833
Had you sent a word,
I would have come home.

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:40.000
We didn't call you for a shave!

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.541
Go and clean up the toilet.

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.208
You didn't call us for a shave?
Cleaning toilets is not our job.

00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:48.208
Why?

00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:50.583
Do you consider it
beneath you to clean toilets?

00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:52.875
Don't force him.
I'll do it myself.

00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:53.916
Sir…

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.125
Why would you do that?
Please be seated.

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:59.416
Are you going to stand there
and let the leader clean the toilet?

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:01.541
There's no way
the leader will clean it.

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.125
Sir, I'll do it.

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:05.083
Hold this.

00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:33.791
It's done, sir.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.458
At least pay him for his services.

00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.541
-Step aside.
-Make way.

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.041
Keep walking.

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:44.875
-Sir, my money?
-No, thanks.

00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:46.583
Hand me the scissors.

00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:47.916
Pass the scissors.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.750
Here.

00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:55.041
Give it to him.

00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:05.708
It's that simple!
There's no reason to fight over this.

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.791
-Make way.
-Step aside.

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:10.166
What are you waiting for?
Get started!

00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:12.916
Esaki, you go first.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.250
-Shall I?
-Yes.

00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:16.666
Why does he get to go first?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.583
Aren't we Northerners queued up?

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.583
Sudalai, you go first.

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:23.083
Why me?

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.708
Esaki is waiting here.

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:26.583
I said, go!

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:30.708
Go.

00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:34.125
Get that billhook.

00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:37.500
If any of you steps foot in there,
I will chop your legs off!

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:38.458
Listen…

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.083
I can't go in confined spaces.

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:43.125
I'll go out in the open,
where it's breezy.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.458
Shut up, man!

00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:47.291
Mathi, we've agreed that
it's common to both our villages.

00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:49.166
So many of our people are waiting.

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:50.958
Let them go first.

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:52.291
You can go later.

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:53.625
Get in there!

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.041
Stop! Why so?

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:58.666
So that it goes down in history that the
Southerners shat after the Northerners?

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.000
Our caste is nothing less than yours.

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:03.208
Why the hell should we go second?

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:04.791
Our caste is no less important!

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:08.083
You have brought caste
into shitting as well!

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:10.750
You have a problem over
who gets to shit first, right?

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:12.000
I'll go first.

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:14.166
-Sir, you don't have to--
-Shut up!

00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:19.958
Wow! The leader shitting first is like
adorning the walls with sandal paste.

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.625
This doesn't count.

00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:23.416
What matters is who gets to go next.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.000
Here we go again!

00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:27.791
It is obvious.
It has to be a Southerner.

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:29.541
Yeah, right!

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:32.500
People who don't wipe their asses
want to use toilets now!

00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:39.250
Who the hell was that?

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:46.375
Look at him.

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:50.583
Right.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:06.541
Hey! Don't fight! Stop it!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.750
Come on, let's go in the fields now.

00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:14.375
We are fighting for our pride
and you still want to shit?

00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:15.791
Give me that mug!

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.583
Get out of here!

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:37.166
They are fighting over
who gets to use the toilet first.

00:17:37.458 --> 00:17:40.166
Nobody even bothered to
check if there is water supply.

00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:52.833
Out of my way!

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.041
Sir?

00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:56.708
Sir?

00:17:57.916 --> 00:18:00.458
How dare you lay a hand on me?

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:02.041
Die!

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.125
Sir!

00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:09.041
Your Southern asses want to
shit in the North? Bloody pests!

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:12.875
He is beating me up!

00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:14.541
Brother, help me!

00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:18.250
How dare you hit him!

00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:21.500
Sir!

00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:31.583
-Mathi, lift his legs.
-Watch the steps.

00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:33.625
-Make way.
-Careful.

00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:35.791
Mind his head.

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:37.083
Gently.

00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:41.333
If we must share it with the Southerners,
we don't want a toilet at all.

00:18:41.416 --> 00:18:42.458
Demolish it.

00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:43.708
Let's go.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.375
Demolish the toilet!

00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:50.291
Come on.

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.458
Wreck it!

00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:53.833
-Destroy it!
-Raze it to the ground!

00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:55.541
Wreck it!

00:18:55.625 --> 00:18:58.458
-Wreck every last brick.
-Come on!

00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:00.333
Smash it up!

00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:02.208
Break down the other wall!

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.750
Bring it down.

00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:24.541
<i>There is one ancient code</i>
<i>That divides us into many castes</i>

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.500

<i>Our village is a paradise</i>

<i>Where brothers fight with each other</i>

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.250
<i>Our village is a bed of roses</i>
<i>There's nothing quite like it</i>

00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:41.125
Jackass! Come in through
the back porch.

00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:43.250
<i>No job, no wages</i>

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.333
-Yes, ma'am?
-The old man needs a shave.

00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:47.166

<i>Is there a way to defy the code?</i>

00:19:57.125 --> 00:19:58.000
Ten rupees.

00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:00.625
You want ten rupees
for shaving a couple of hairs?

00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:05.208
I was hoping for some money.
But porridge works just fine.

00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:07.416
-Do the dishes on your way out.
-Sure.

00:20:10.541 --> 00:20:13.500

<i>We love freebies</i>

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:35.791
For your 100 rupees, should I turn
on the lights at six o'clock? Get lost!

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:37.333
<i>We forget our woes with TV</i>

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:04.208
All the other kids go to school,
while my son just watches them.

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:06.083
Why won't you shut up?

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:07.958

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.250

I have dug up a 700 feet <i>borewell</i>.

00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:41.541
Oh, shut up!

00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:44.291
You won't find good water
anywhere else in this village.

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:45.791
Don't try to haggle with me.

-Take it.
-Just give me one can.

00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:57.541
You already owe me 240 rupees.
You always have money for liquor, right?

00:21:57.625 --> 00:22:00.916

I'm going.

00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:13.666
He's busy putting up posters!

00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:17.458
They destroyed government property.

00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:19.083
Ten people are injured.

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:20.833
One of them broke his neck.

00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:23.250
Just say the word,
and I will file a case.

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:25.083
This is an internal dispute.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.875
We'll resolve it among ourselves.

00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:28.041
You may leave.

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:30.458

-Soorangudi.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.125

-No, thanks.

No one's giving you a choice.

00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.083
Pay up.

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:42.208

Why don't you sit?

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.708
At least you could sit!

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:50.125
No. He only sits in cars.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.041
Sit, I dare you.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.166

Why can't you
drop us off at the village?

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:02.333
At my age,
I find it very hard to walk.

00:23:02.416 --> 00:23:04.291

00:24:28.208 --> 00:24:29.666
They won't let you in their homes.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.541
But they eat the rice you buy.

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:32.750
Do you see the irony?

00:24:32.833 --> 00:24:34.541
I see the tamarind under the scale.

00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.500
<i>"Even when we must skip a meal"</i>

00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:38.541
Thank you!

00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:42.625
<i>Cheering for our superstars</i>
<i>At the movie theaters</i>

00:24:42.708 --> 00:24:46.458
<i>Even when we must skip a meal</i>
<i>We forget our woes watching TV</i>

00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:51.125
<i>Cheering for our superstars</i>
<i>At the movie theaters</i>

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:52.500
Money?

00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:53.625
No, thanks.

00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:58.541
Everyone makes us work for free!

00:24:58.625 --> 00:25:01.166
If you don't ask them for money,
I will.

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:03.541
No. Don't do that.

00:25:03.666 --> 00:25:06.625
We have jobs only as long as
the villagers grow hair.

00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:08.250
Some job this is!

00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:10.041
He slapped you
for getting into his car.

00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:12.416
Do you feel no pain or shame?

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.625
My father had a dream.

00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:18.333
I want to open up a big salon
under this banyan tree.

00:25:18.458 --> 00:25:20.166
I'm saving money for it.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.500
I can't let go of my livelihood
in the name of dignity.

00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:24.833
{\an8}I know it hurts,
but we must carry on.

00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:27.750
Give me two rupees.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.041
But I gave you all that lice!

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.625
Pay up, girl!

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.041
Screw you, Jackass!

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:21.416
Tell me.

00:26:21.708 --> 00:26:22.833
Is it there?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.041
Hey…

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.458
Esaki was loitering here yesterday.

00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:33.416
Don't you buy the liquor?

00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:40.041
So, someone stole your money.
Why have you come to me?

00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:42.625
You were the only one
creeping around the tree yesterday.

00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:43.583
I saw you.

00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:45.166
Are you calling me a thief?

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.500
I borrowed money
at an interest to buy alcohol.

00:26:47.583 --> 00:26:48.666
No, sir.

00:26:48.875 --> 00:26:51.750
I worked hard to save money
for opening a salon.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Have you seen it?

00:26:53.083 --> 00:26:54.750
Had I seen it,
I would have given it to you.

00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:56.458
If you wanted to open a salon,

00:26:56.541 --> 00:26:59.833
you should have deposited it
in the bank or the post office.

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:03.083
You can take a loan
from them to open a salon.

00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:05.083
That's how I got
a loan for my tractor.

00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:06.500
You bought a tractor?

00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:08.333
No, I just took the loan.

00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:10.000
Okay.

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:11.750
I will deposit my money
in the post office.

00:27:11.833 --> 00:27:14.416
But you have lost all your money.
What's left to deposit?

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.833
I only lost my money.

00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:20.375
I had kept Side Burn's
4,000 rupees tucked in at my waist.

00:27:20.708 --> 00:27:21.833
Four thousand rupees?

00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:23.833
Tucked in at your waist?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.125
Alright.

00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:39.916
There is no back entrance here.
How do we enter?

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:41.458
So, have you got the total?

00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:44.625
When you deposit it
in the account three weeks later…

00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:46.250
What do you want?

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.916
Doesn't this place
have a back entrance?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.791
No. Please come in.

00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:55.500
Please give me an account
to put my money in.

00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:57.875
An account isn't some object
that you put your money in.

00:27:57.958 --> 00:28:01.250
We will safely keep
your money here in your name.

00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:03.500
-That's called an account.
-Here?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.333
Go and get your <i>Aadhaar</i> card.
You need it for the registration.

00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:10.541
Okay.

00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:13.916
But you don't have any identity card.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.541
Why did you just nod to her?

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:17.666
I'll just say, "I'm a man who
resides under a banyan tree."

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.916
They will give me an
<i>Aadhaar</i> card. Let's go.

00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:24.333
That's how the door is.
Put it back on your way out.

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:29.625
Looks like this place might crumble.
Should we really put our money here?

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.250
Still better than hiding it
in the bark of the tree.

00:28:36.916 --> 00:28:39.000
You need a ration card
to apply for an <i>Aadhaar</i> card.

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:41.666
-Do you have a ration card?
-You want a ration card?

00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:42.958
Do you have a voter ID?

00:28:43.041 --> 00:28:44.916
We can get you a voter ID.

00:28:45.166 --> 00:28:47.000
Show me your <i>Aadhaar</i> card.

00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:52.708
-You don't have any identity card?
-No.

00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:55.250
If you don't have any identification,

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:57.625
how do I believe that
you are an Indian citizen?

00:28:57.708 --> 00:29:00.291
Well, does he look like
an American to you?

00:29:00.375 --> 00:29:02.416
Believe me, he is an Indian citizen.

00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:06.666
Sit.

00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:07.875
It's fine.

00:29:08.166 --> 00:29:09.208
Sit!

00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:16.250
You can't open an account
without an identity card.

00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:18.375
We need your birth certificate.

00:29:18.666 --> 00:29:20.791
We can look for your name
in the records.

00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:22.041
What's your name?

00:29:22.666 --> 00:29:23.750
Smile.

00:29:24.041 --> 00:29:25.708
Smile?
What sort of a name is that?

00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:28.708
My mouth doesn't shut properly.
It looks like I'm smiling all the time.

00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:32.333
So, everyone calls me
Smile or Jackass.

00:29:32.416 --> 00:29:34.833
Are these your only names?
Don't you have any other name?

00:29:34.916 --> 00:29:35.791
He does!

00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:39.416
Bushy Hair, Dung Picker, Rice Sack,
and several other names.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.916
These are not real names!

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.541
Didn't your parents
give you a name?

00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:44.875
They must have.
But I don't remember it.

00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:48.500
People kept calling me so many names
that I eventually forgot my actual name.

00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:51.375
You can't just give up your
real name because of these people.

00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:52.583
Here's what you can do.

00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:56.000
Go to the villagers and
find out your real name.

00:29:56.125 --> 00:29:58.208
I'm sure someone would know.

00:30:00.916 --> 00:30:02.541
What could they have named you?

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:04.916
They still give us names
like Ramesh or Suresh.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.750
I'm sure they didn't
name you Virat Kohli.

00:30:06.833 --> 00:30:07.916
My kid knows it!

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.916
Girl, what's his name?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.625
-Say it!
-Monster!

00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:14.291
You should have come straight to me.

00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:17.375
I was the one
who named you at birth.

00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:18.583
What was it?

00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:20.416
It's a beautiful name.

00:30:20.916 --> 00:30:23.708
It's on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't recall it…

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.333
You got a <i>beedi</i>?

00:30:27.083 --> 00:30:28.333
Get him a <i>beedi</i>.

00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:33.875
Your father named you Smile.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.291
He could hardly manage Tamil,
and he gave me an English name?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.958
Grandpa…

00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:45.833
Yes, I remember.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.750
Your name is…

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.625
Your name…

00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:56.500
It's on the tip of my tongue.

00:30:57.375 --> 00:30:58.833
You got a <i>beedi</i>?

00:31:06.166 --> 00:31:10.041
-Hand me the sample.
-The site limits end with the river.

00:31:11.708 --> 00:31:13.166
Hey, go away!

00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:14.333
Go!

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.333
Sir, coffee?

00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:17.041
-No. I'm on a diet.
-Okay.

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:19.625
Are you eating well?

00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:23.333
The local body elections are
just two months away.

00:31:23.458 --> 00:31:25.666
You chose the wrong time to fall sick!

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.083
There's no need to worry.
I will contest the elections.

00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:31.000
What? You will contest it?

00:31:31.083 --> 00:31:33.125
You can barely sit upright.

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:36.125
The approval for the quartz factory
is still pending.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.875
Why don't you just take a look
at it and approve it?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.500
What is it?

00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:44.458
A factory in the village
is a sign of development.

00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:47.000
There will be better roads,
and water supply.

00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:49.083
All the villagers will get jobs.

00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:51.958
They will build a new school.

00:31:52.166 --> 00:31:54.250
They will build a hospital
for their employees.

00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:56.333
Your people can use it too.

00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:58.666
Your village will turn into a city.

00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.291
I'm sure it will.

00:32:01.666 --> 00:32:05.333
But our villagers won't be alive
to enjoy the facilities of a city.

00:32:05.708 --> 00:32:08.916
They are willing to pay crores
for the president's signature.

00:32:09.583 --> 00:32:11.833
It's about time you made some money.

00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:16.375
I will not give my signature for a project
that will bring harm to the village.

00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:19.375
We took a good look
at everything you've accomplished.

00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:22.500
You used lakhs from the funds
to build a school and a toilet.

00:32:22.583 --> 00:32:23.916
But what was the outcome?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.541
They lay in ruins!

00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:27.458
This village has been
rotting for many years.

00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:29.916
A factory won't make it any worse.

00:32:41.458 --> 00:32:42.750
Here's an idea.

00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:44.958
Don't contest the elections.

00:32:45.875 --> 00:32:47.416
Give someone else a chance.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.416
Let your son contest instead.

00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:55.250
My sons fight over a toilet!

00:32:56.458 --> 00:32:58.250
They will end up
splitting the village in two.

00:32:58.333 --> 00:32:59.416
Of course not.

00:32:59.583 --> 00:33:00.958
You have a lot of clout.

00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:03.541
Whoever you point to
will become the next president.

00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:06.125
No one will argue over your decision.

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:09.458
So, just go ahead and
point to your successor.

00:33:09.708 --> 00:33:12.041
Hopefully the new president
will accomplish something.

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:13.541
I'll see you later.

00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:15.500
See you, ma'am.

00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:30.541
Sir, is the president's signature
all we need?

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:31.458
Yes.

00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:33.250
You said they will pay us in crores.

00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:35.125
What's the ballpark figure?

00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:38.500
About five large ones.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.708
Five crore rupees?

00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:41.083
Let's go.

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:51.458
Their jaws dropped
at five crore rupees.

00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:53.625
If we reveal that
it's actually 30 crore rupees,

00:33:53.708 --> 00:33:55.291
they might even sell the village!

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:56.500
I don't care what they do.

00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:59.625
I just want my commission,
which is ten percent flat.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:04.375
Drive carefully, please!

00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:07.458
I can't help it.
These roads are terrible.

00:34:19.541 --> 00:34:22.958
Well, nobody knows my
name in the village.

00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:24.708
Let's just go with Smile.

00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:26.791
Keep my money safe.

00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:29.791
Let's give you a new name.

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:31.625
A new name?

00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:34.541
Is that possible?

00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:37.083
All you need is a signature
from the village president.

00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:40.916
We can use that to get you
an <i>Aadhaar</i> card, voter ID, etc.

00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:43.958
Tell me.
What kind of a name do you want?

00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:46.166
Any name that suits me.

00:34:49.291 --> 00:34:50.416
Ready?

00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:53.833
Gandhi?

00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:56.958
It doesn't suit him.

00:34:59.666 --> 00:35:00.875
Netaji?

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.500
Rohit Sharma!

00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:08.708
Turn back.

00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:13.000
Ajith Kumar.

00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:14.875
Don't you dare turn!

00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:16.916
Try another name.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.875
Atharva?

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:18.958
Jagapathi Babu?

00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.041
Phillips?

00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:21.291
Ganapathi Iyer?

00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:22.541
Hussain Bhai?

00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:27.791
Nesamani!

00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:30.625
Manonmani.

00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:33.875
Pichamuthu.

00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:48.125
Mandela!

00:35:49.083 --> 00:35:50.125
Sounds good!

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.458
-Who is he?
-He was just like you!

00:35:52.791 --> 00:35:54.750
Was he a barber like me?

00:35:55.791 --> 00:35:58.083
Just like you are
fighting for your identity,

00:35:58.166 --> 00:36:01.750
he was a revolutionary who fought
for the identity of black people.

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:04.458
I have no clue
what he fought for…

00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:07.041
but he has curly hair
and dark skin just like me.

00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:08.458
And he looks really smart.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.250
This is your new name!

00:36:10.416 --> 00:36:12.458
If anyone calls you
Jackass ever again,

00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.958
you will tell them,
"My name is Nelson Mandela."

00:36:15.041 --> 00:36:16.250
Say the name again.

00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.750
Nelson…

00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:21.583
Mandela.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.916
Nelson Mandela.

00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:33.291
What a great name!

00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:36.583
Sounds like an upper-caste name.

00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:37.958
Do you like the name?

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.833
Then it's yours to keep.

00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.541
How about a new name
for you as well?

00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:44.250
Why? What's wrong with Side Burn?

00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:46.791
Maybe we should add "Khan" to it.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.250
Side Burn Khan.

00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:51.375
Side Burn Khan.
It has a nice ring to it.

00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:52.541
Side Burn Khan.

00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:53.958
Let's go to the town.

00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:01.250
We need to click a photo.

00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:02.250
Sit.

00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:03.333
Come

00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:22.500
Look here.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.250
Ready? Smile!

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.750
-Nelson Mandela.
-That's me.

00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:45.458
Here. Keep this safe.

00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:47.791
I've used this to apply
for all your ID cards.

00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:50.583
If Esaki asks for my money,
don't give it to him, ma'am.

00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:53.583
The money is in your account.
No one else can take it.

00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:56.500
And stop calling me "ma'am."
It makes me feel old.

00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:58.291
Okay.

00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:01.500
You went all the way to town
just to help me.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.541
But I have nothing to give you.

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:04.958
There's no need for that.

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:07.583
Maybe I could…

00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:10.500
dye your Grey hairs?

00:38:18.708 --> 00:38:19.708
Mandela!

00:38:21.916 --> 00:38:23.791
I just wanted to
call you by your name.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.166
<i>Calling out your name, handsome!</i>

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.291
What?

00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:39.083
<i>There she goes</i>
<i>Like a beautiful blossomed flower</i>

00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:43.833
<i>She's raising a roof over your head</i>

00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:47.250
<i>She's barging into your heart</i>

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.750
<i>Playing the wedding drums</i>

00:38:52.166 --> 00:38:55.625
<i>Sends a message to the skies</i>

00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.833
<i>Watch the shaving blade glint!</i>

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.958
<i>-Who's on his mind?</i>
-Hop on.

00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:10.666
-Get down.
-Come, Grandma.

00:39:11.083 --> 00:39:12.500
Take her basket.

00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:32.541
Are these people disabled?

00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:34.458
Why can't they collect their own ration?

00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:36.916
I live at their mercy.
I must do as they say.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.333
You don't need anybody's mercy.

00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:41.291
You toil to make your own money.
You need not do all this!

00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:47.791
-Let's go.
-<i>This fragrant blossom has spoken</i>

00:39:48.291 --> 00:39:51.916
<i>She is straightforward and outspoken</i>

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.166
<i>The wafting wind delivered a message</i>

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.625
<i>Carrying away the painful past with it</i>

00:40:00.875 --> 00:40:04.375
<i>The blossoms in the wind sing me a story</i>

00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:08.583
<i>Like a lovely melody</i>

00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:11.250
<i>A pearl harvest from</i>
<i>The freshwater of Courtallam</i>

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:13.291
<i>A surge of water in scorched lands</i>

00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:17.500
<i>Serenading a cactus blossom</i>
<i>Song and dance and nuptial drums!</i>

00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:20.958
<i>Calling out your name, handsome!</i>

00:40:21.666 --> 00:40:25.041
<i>There she goes, a fresh bloom!</i>

00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:29.916
<i>Like a hailstorm, like a bridge</i>

00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.541
<i>Here she arrives, like a solace</i>

00:40:34.791 --> 00:40:37.083
This is just like drawing.
Try it out.

00:40:38.291 --> 00:40:42.375
<i>The scorching summer sun is sizzling cold</i>
<i>This small anchovy is losing its sleep</i>

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.666
<i>These pliant scissors turn into earrings</i>
<i>The clear skies burst into showers</i>

00:40:46.791 --> 00:40:50.416
<i>In this roofless castle</i>

00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:54.250
<i>Even the Sun seems to giggle</i>

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.583
<i>Watch the shaving blade glint!</i>

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:02.833
<i>Watch the Sun giggle!</i>

00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:20.500
What is it?

00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:22.750
As the MLA said,

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:24.875
both of them want to
contest in the elections.

00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:28.708
So, I said, whomever the leader points to
will be the one who contests the election.

00:41:28.791 --> 00:41:30.708
Now, go ahead
and point to one of them.

00:41:51.666 --> 00:41:53.333
What will you do if you win?

00:41:53.583 --> 00:41:55.166
If I win…

00:41:55.958 --> 00:41:58.250
I'll throw a party for the boys.

00:41:58.708 --> 00:42:00.916
They have been wanting to go to Goa.

00:42:01.416 --> 00:42:02.916
I'll take them on a trip!

00:42:03.166 --> 00:42:05.625
He meant,
what will you do for the village?

00:42:05.708 --> 00:42:07.083
Oh, the village!

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.625
Well…

00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:12.416
I will upgrade the bar
and make it air-conditioned.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.666
What do you say?

00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:17.083
And to celebrate my victory,
I will screen a movie.

00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:18.916
Throw a feast.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.625
It will be like a carnival.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.916
What do you say?

00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:23.625
It will be a grand affair.

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:25.625
That's how you people think.

00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:28.666
When asked about people's welfare,
he only thinks of booze.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.416
You need more exposure to politics.

00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:32.833
If I get elected…

00:42:32.916 --> 00:42:35.791
I will deposit fifteen thousand
rupees in every villager's account.

00:42:35.875 --> 00:42:38.541
How much liquor can we buy
with that kind of money?

00:42:38.625 --> 00:42:41.000
These people have never even heard
of bank accounts.

00:42:41.083 --> 00:42:42.833
And he plans to deposit money!

00:42:42.916 --> 00:42:45.416
These people will perish
before they see any progress.

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:46.583
Are you serious?

00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:48.333
It's not like they will remember.

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:50.666
Don't underestimate my ability!

00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:53.375
I'll deposit twenty thousand rupees!

00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:54.708
Twenty thousand!

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.250
Twenty-five thousand.

00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:57.375
Thirty.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.458
Thirty-five.

00:42:58.541 --> 00:42:59.375
Forty!

00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:00.333
-Forty--
-Stop it!

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:02.791
If you keep going at it,
this will never end.

00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:06.333
Look, they are both itching
to serve the village.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.125
The decision is yours.

00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:18.166
Neither of you shall contest.
Get out!

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.708
Why not?

00:43:20.875 --> 00:43:22.958
This will end in communal riots.

00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:24.583
You worry about
conflicts all the time.

00:43:24.666 --> 00:43:28.000
When you had to get the toilet built,
you made a third party do it out of fear!

00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:31.458
When you had to get the road built,
you made a third party do it out of fear!

00:43:31.541 --> 00:43:33.333
We won't let you off the hook this time.

00:43:33.416 --> 00:43:35.000
You need to pick a side.

00:43:35.125 --> 00:43:36.541
Choose one of them.

00:43:37.625 --> 00:43:38.916
This won't work out.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.333
Rathinam, you should contest.

00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:42.458
Our people will vote for you
and make you win.

00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:44.708
-What do you say?
-Yes, we will!

00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:47.458
Did you hear that?
Our caste isn't inferior to theirs!

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.666
We Southerners must show them!

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.458
Mathi, you should contest!

00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:53.291
Let's see whether
the North wins or the South!

00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:54.958
Sure, we will.

00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:56.291
We will win!

00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:57.625
Oh, we'll see!

00:43:58.625 --> 00:44:00.375
Guys, make some noise!

00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:02.375
-Mathi, warrior of the South!
-Rathinam, our champion!

00:44:02.458 --> 00:44:04.500
-Mathi is one of our own!
-Hail Rathinam!

00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:05.958
Rathinam for the village president!

00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:08.875
Mathi for the President of India!

00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:16.375
-Long live…
-Rathinam!

00:44:16.458 --> 00:44:18.125
-Long live…
-Rathinam!

00:44:18.208 --> 00:44:19.416
Long live…

00:44:19.625 --> 00:44:23.208
Rathinam is the light of the North!

00:44:25.083 --> 00:44:26.416
-Long live…
-Rathinam!

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.541
Make some noise.

00:44:27.625 --> 00:44:29.125
-Long live…
-Rathinam!

00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.458
-Hail our brother!
-Hail Mathi!

00:44:31.541 --> 00:44:33.541
-Hail our son!
-Hail Mathi!

00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:35.625
-Hail our leader…
-Mathi!

00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:09.708
What symbol did they choose?

00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:10.958
Coconut.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.333
-Our symbol is…
-Coconut!

00:45:15.416 --> 00:45:17.166
-Our symbol is…
-Coconut!

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.875
-Vote for…
-Coconut!

00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:20.875
-The coconut…
-Is our symbol.

00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:22.833
-Our symbol is…
-Coconut!

00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:24.708
-Coconut…
-Our symbol!

00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:26.416
-Vote for…
-Road Roller!

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.625
-Our symbol…
-Road Roller!

00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:31.458
A total of 687 votes.

00:45:31.666 --> 00:45:35.291
Leaving out the dead and
the errors in paperwork, it's 682.

00:45:35.375 --> 00:45:37.833
I stand to gain nothing
from winning this election.

00:45:37.916 --> 00:45:40.625
In fact, I'll be losing money.
And yet, I am contesting.

00:45:40.708 --> 00:45:43.750
Don't think I'm contesting
the elections for power or money.

00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:45.625
I'm contesting for our people.

00:45:45.708 --> 00:45:49.291
If we lose against a Northerner,
they will keep rubbing it in forever.

00:45:49.375 --> 00:45:52.166
We cannot lose to
a Southerner at any cost.

00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:53.791
We must win this election.

00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:55.375
-Our symbol is…
-Road Roller!

00:45:55.458 --> 00:45:56.916
-Our symbol is…
-Road Roller!

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.416
Make a list of all Northeners' votes.

00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:10.958
Strike out the Northerners' names.

00:46:18.083 --> 00:46:19.625
Do you even need to ask?

00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:23.791
They broke my son's leg
for setting foot in their playground!

00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:27.666
I am just waiting for payback.
You've got my vote.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.666
All the Southerners will back you.
Go for it!

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.250
-I'm glad. See you.
-So long.

00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:33.875
Give me that.

00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:38.125
Our men have
a separate booth in the grove.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.541
Give this to them
and collect 2000 rupees.

00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:42.208
Note down the serial number.

00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:44.375
He said he will be voting for us.

00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:46.291
Why are you wasting money?

00:46:46.375 --> 00:46:49.333
What if they don't turn up
on the voting day?

00:46:49.416 --> 00:46:54.250
With the serial numbers, we will know
who voted, and who didn't show up.

00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:57.083
And then, we can drag
the no-shows to the polling booth.

00:46:58.041 --> 00:46:59.166
That's right!

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.208
Even our people are talking about
their 20 rupee tokens.

00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:04.625
Then let's give out 50 rupee tokens.

00:47:04.791 --> 00:47:06.291
There's no need for that.

00:47:06.916 --> 00:47:07.958
What, then?

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.375
Malar!

00:47:10.166 --> 00:47:11.375
Welcome, sister.

00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:13.291
Take the money.

00:47:14.291 --> 00:47:15.375
Go on.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.916
Apply some vermilion.

00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:21.708
On your nuptial chain, girl.

00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:25.333
Apply it on your nuptial chain, girl!

00:47:28.458 --> 00:47:30.625
Now, use the same hand
to take the money.

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:35.458
You have sworn your husband's life
on this money.

00:47:35.666 --> 00:47:37.583
Vote for us without fail.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.625
Let's go.

00:47:38.708 --> 00:47:40.041
-Murugesan, I'll see you.
-Okay, brother.

00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:41.541
Coconut symbol. Don't forget.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.166
That's how it's done.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:46.583
Instead, those idiots are
going around giving tokens!

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:47.916
Make some noise, boys.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.791
-Our symbol…
-Coconut!

00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:51.791
-Vote for…
-Coconut symbol!

00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:53.375
Vote for us!

00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:56.666
-Don't forget to vote for us.
-Of course.

00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:13.916
-Vote for…
-Coconut symbol!

00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.083
-Our symbol…
-Coconut symbol!

00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:40.458
-Our symbol…
-Coconut symbol!

00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:42.166
-Vote for…
-Coconut!

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.500
-Our symbol…
-Coconut symbol!

00:48:43.583 --> 00:48:45.083
-Vote for…
-<i>Idlis!</i>

00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:46.625
-Vote for…
-<i>Chutney!</i>

00:48:46.708 --> 00:48:47.958
Vote for…

00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:49.916
Coconut symbol!

00:48:51.166 --> 00:48:52.541
Stop, little ones.

00:49:09.833 --> 00:49:12.500
We have 317 votes from the village.

00:49:12.666 --> 00:49:13.916
Just 317?

00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:15.375
Including new voters?

00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:18.250
What about women
who married into our families?

00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:19.708
I have taken account of everyone.

00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:22.708
Some voters have moved out
and settled elsewhere.

00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:24.833
And none of them
has come back to the village.

00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:27.916
But I've spoken to them over phone.
They will definitely be here.

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:31.041
I'm working hard to ensure
we don't lose a single vote,

00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:33.375
and you blindly trust them
to come here to vote for us?

00:49:33.458 --> 00:49:35.458
-Let's drive down there.
-Okay.

00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:51.166
-Vote for…
-Road Roller!

00:49:51.666 --> 00:49:53.583
They've brought back voters from the city!

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.500
Don't we have voters
from outside the village?

00:49:56.583 --> 00:49:58.041
No, we don't.

00:49:58.708 --> 00:50:00.291
Votes from outside the country?

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.791
Outside the country…

00:50:05.333 --> 00:50:06.250
{\an8}WELCOMING INTERNATIONAL VOTERS
OF SOUTH SOORANGUDI

00:50:06.333 --> 00:50:09.000
-Is everyone here?
-Yes. He's the last one.

00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:12.208
Welcome, mate!
Are you doing well?

00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:15.458
You have come from
miles away to vote for me!

00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:16.708
Vote for you?

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
You told me that my father was ill!

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:22.000
Well, he was in a critical condition…

00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:24.333
but when he got to know
that you'd be here to vote…

00:50:24.416 --> 00:50:26.250
-he bounced back.
-What are you blabbering?

00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:28.750
Nothing. Come on.
It's been ages since we met!

00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:30.458
Let's go, buddy!

00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:33.583
Hey, Jackass!
What took you so long? Hurry up!

00:50:37.833 --> 00:50:40.541
My name is not Jackass anymore.

00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:41.708
It has been changed.

00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:44.208
My name is Mandela.
Look at this.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:45.708
He doesn't like being called Jackass.

00:50:45.791 --> 00:50:48.291
Why? Is the name Jackass
beneath you?

00:50:48.416 --> 00:50:49.416
Don't tell me what to call you.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.166
Buzz off, Jackass!

00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:00.041
That's okay.

00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:03.125
Since I have a foreign name,
she couldn't pronounce it.

00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:06.041
Jackass!

00:51:06.583 --> 00:51:08.125
Be right there, Grandma!

00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:16.583
Hey, buddy!
Let's go and put up some posters.

00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:19.125
Don't bother him.

00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:22.875
He is upset because
his father was in a critical condition.

00:51:24.416 --> 00:51:26.625
Take good care of him.
His vote is important!

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.958
Don't give me that look.
There are two voters in my family as well.

00:51:38.041 --> 00:51:41.333
What if I forget to vote?
This will help me remember.

00:51:41.416 --> 00:51:42.708
Am I right?

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:49.708
-What's the count?
-It's 340 for us.

00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.083
-Their count is 341.
-What are you saying?

00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:54.625
The Southerners are
leading by one vote.

00:51:54.916 --> 00:51:56.458
Don't worry, alright?

00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:57.625
It's just one vote!

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.833
If we butcher a couple of Southerners,
we will take the lead.

00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:02.333
Let's go, guys.

00:52:02.458 --> 00:52:05.375
Do you think you'll kill their people
and they'll let it slide?

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.750
They'll kill four of our people!
We'll end up killing each other!

00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:09.916
Don't you want us
to do anything about it?

00:52:14.708 --> 00:52:16.000
There is a way.

00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:31.125
The old hag's name is Mookaayi.
She's 90 years old.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:32.833
Her life is hanging by a thread.

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:35.500
If we do away with her,
no one would doubt us.

00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:38.666
-Who is at home with her?
-Just her grandson.

00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:43.833
-What's that for?
-To kill the old lady.

00:52:43.916 --> 00:52:46.541
Put that away.
A loud yelp would finish her off.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.041
Tighten it.

00:53:02.166 --> 00:53:03.500
It keeps coming undone.

00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:13.541
Catch him!

00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:15.708
Don't let him get away!

00:53:16.625 --> 00:53:18.250
-Stop!
-Don't spare him!

00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:21.583
Where did he go?

00:53:22.916 --> 00:53:24.166
He got away!

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.958
Did you see that, old lady?
Your vote is in demand.

00:53:28.083 --> 00:53:30.333
The pride of the Southerners
lies in your hands.

00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:32.250
The election is just 28 days away.

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:35.166
Just hold onto your dear life
until then.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.333
If you manage to cast your vote…

00:53:37.583 --> 00:53:40.250
we will put up an idol of yours
next to our village deity.

00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:41.958
Will you keep this in mind?

00:53:43.375 --> 00:53:44.791
Will you vote correctly?

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.916
Tell me.
Who will you vote for?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.250
M.G.R.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.541
You old hag, it's been 30 years
since M.G.R. died!

00:53:57.625 --> 00:53:59.375
M.G.R. is dead?

00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:04.000
Old lady?

00:54:06.333 --> 00:54:07.375
Old lady?

00:54:07.916 --> 00:54:09.041
Old lady?

00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:11.541
What happened?

00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:13.666
We lost a vote.

00:54:15.375 --> 00:54:16.333
Grandma!

00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:17.875
Grandma!

00:54:18.208 --> 00:54:20.833
You've left me, Grandma!

00:54:21.416 --> 00:54:24.125
I have no one left!

00:54:24.208 --> 00:54:26.583
Grandma, I have nobody!

00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:28.041
Grandma…

00:54:28.375 --> 00:54:30.041
You were always by my side…

00:54:30.208 --> 00:54:31.416
We need to find a vote.

00:54:31.791 --> 00:54:32.875
Find a vote?

00:54:33.333 --> 00:54:34.791
Where will we find a vote?

00:54:34.875 --> 00:54:37.833
Take me with you, Grandma!
Take me along!

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.750
It's bad enough
that we lost one vote…

00:54:40.833 --> 00:54:43.041
-and you want her to take you with her!
-Hey!

00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:44.833
Calm down!

00:54:45.083 --> 00:54:47.208
We lost the lead, mate!

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.958
Now, we can win only if some
Northerner votes for us out of pity!

00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:56.833
Hey, oldies! If any of you
bites the dust before the election,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.458
there will be hell to pay.

00:55:06.708 --> 00:55:07.750
Sudalai…

00:55:12.625 --> 00:55:15.875
So, you're one vote short.
Couldn't you find someone else?

00:55:16.083 --> 00:55:17.666
There are other people in the village.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.791
You are the only centrist
in North Soorangudi.

00:55:19.875 --> 00:55:21.875
-Yeah, so?
-We appreciate your risk.

00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:23.458
Just tell us your price.

00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:24.791
We have come prepared.

00:55:26.375 --> 00:55:29.125
Please keep your money
and leave immediately.

00:55:29.208 --> 00:55:32.541
If Kaalai sees me talking to
a Northerner during election time…

00:55:32.708 --> 00:55:34.208
You wretched jerks!

00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:35.708
If you are short on votes,
then go die!

00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:37.166
Why have you come here to beg?

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.500
Who is begging?

00:55:38.583 --> 00:55:40.375
We are paying him for his vote,
just like you.

00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:41.583
Paying him?

00:55:41.666 --> 00:55:44.375
No Northerner will vote for you
even if you write off all your assets.

00:55:44.458 --> 00:55:45.416
Says who?

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.416
He agreed to vote
for us for 400 rupees.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.916
But then you came and
spoiled the party. Let's go.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.125
See you, brother.

00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:56.541
We are working our asses off
to secure every single vote,

00:55:56.625 --> 00:55:59.000
and you dared to sell
your vote for 400 rupees!

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:05.000
This is a warning to every Northerner!

00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:08.250
If anybody among you dares
to vote for the Southerner,

00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:10.333
you will be dead meat!

00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:17.208
If we let this slide,
they will try to buy everyone off.

00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:21.083
We need to gain a lead at any cost.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.916
What can we do?

00:56:31.125 --> 00:56:32.416
There is a way.

00:56:39.416 --> 00:56:41.750
A single vote is all they need.

00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:43.666
Your vote is going to waste anyway.

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.458
Just give it to one of them.

00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:52.583
You shameless oafs
are begging for votes!

00:57:10.125 --> 00:57:11.583
We…

00:57:13.666 --> 00:57:14.708
But…

00:57:16.083 --> 00:57:17.208
No, thanks!

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.375
We need only one vote.

00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:24.375
Why should you beg him?
I'll cast one fake vote.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.458
Would you let them cast fake votes?

00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:28.458
No way!
I will scrutinize every vote.

00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:30.250
Won't they do the same, you moron?

00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:31.875
You, Northerners!

00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:35.625
I'll pay one lakh for a vote.

00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:38.041
Is there a real man among you

00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:39.875
who'd vote for the Road Roller?

00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:47.375
I'll give away half my wealth.

00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:51.833
Is any Southerner brave enough
to vote for the Coconut?

00:57:51.916 --> 00:57:53.125
What is this?

00:57:54.166 --> 00:57:56.791
Half his wealth, my ass!

00:57:58.125 --> 00:58:01.000
My mother shares a side
of her bed with your poor mother.

00:58:01.125 --> 00:58:02.458
Won't I give half my wealth?

00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:04.333
-You scumbag!
-Hey!

00:58:04.875 --> 00:58:07.375
There's no point in talking
to these scoundrels!

00:58:07.458 --> 00:58:10.666
Had we just killed some of them,
we would have been up by a few votes now!

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.250
Just say the word.

00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:14.583
Go ahead. I dare you
to lay a hand on me.

00:58:14.666 --> 00:58:16.458
-Is that a challenge?
-I dare you…

00:58:16.583 --> 00:58:18.666
Only the ones alive
will have to vote.

00:58:56.083 --> 00:58:58.250
All you people have gathered here!

00:58:58.375 --> 00:58:59.541
Is there a festival in town?

00:58:59.625 --> 00:59:01.750
You'll be beaten to death.
Just go away!

00:59:01.833 --> 00:59:03.541
That was uncalled for!

00:59:03.625 --> 00:59:07.958
I just came here to deliver
a new voter ID issued to your villager.

00:59:08.458 --> 00:59:09.875
-Voter ID?
-Yes.

00:59:10.916 --> 00:59:11.958
Here it is.

00:59:42.333 --> 00:59:43.958
Is he a Northerner or a Southerner?

00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:46.750
He is… neither.

00:59:47.208 --> 00:59:48.208
He's sort of neutral.

00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:49.375
Neutral?

00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:51.458
How many such
neutral votes are left?

00:59:51.541 --> 00:59:53.458
We chased them all
out of the village.

00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:55.458
He is the only one left.

00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:57.708
His name was not
on the voter list you provided.

00:59:57.791 --> 01:00:00.458
Yes, but it's there
on the new voter list.

01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:03.291
I was on a pilgrimage,
so I couldn't give it to you sooner.

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.750
Do you know what we went through
for this one vote?

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.625
Superb!

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.500
-Just doing what I can to help.
-Great!

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:18.583
Wake him up.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.666
This is the only voter left.
Don't stone him to death.

01:00:30.916 --> 01:00:31.958
Drop it.

01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:34.041
Jackass!

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:36.166
-Hey, Jackass!
-His name is Mandela.

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:37.916
He doesn't like being called Jackass.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.416
Hey, shut up!

01:00:39.958 --> 01:00:41.041
Jackass!

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:42.375
Hey, Jackass!

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:43.625
Mandela!

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:50.541
Mr. Mandela!

01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:53.125
-Jackass!
-Shut up.

01:00:56.416 --> 01:00:57.500
Mandela!

01:00:58.166 --> 01:00:59.583
-Mandela!
-Mandela!

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.333
-Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:03.458
-Mandela! Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

01:01:03.666 --> 01:01:06.208
-Mandela!
-Mandela!

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:08.083
-Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:09.500
Mr. Mandela!

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.708
-Mr. Mandela!
-Mandela!

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:13.916
Mr. Mandela!

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:16.250
-Mandela!
-Mr. Mandela!

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:17.541
Mandela!

01:01:17.625 --> 01:01:19.208
Mr. Mandela!

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.666
-Mandela, get down.
-Mr. Mandela!

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.166
-Get down.
-Come.

01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:26.791
What are you doing?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:27.958
Jumping down.

01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:30.916
If you end up breaking your leg,
how will you vote?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.333
Make way for the car!

01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:38.500
Keep going.

01:01:43.291 --> 01:01:46.208
Mandela, step on the car
and get down.

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:49.000
That's okay, sir. I'll just jump
off the tree, like I always do.

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:50.916
Just do as we say.
Get on the car.

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:04.541
Be careful, man!

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:07.125
It's okay. It's just a car.

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:09.791
Get down, son.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.250
Are you okay?

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:36.833
Yes.

01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:38.791
Did you apply for a voter ID?

01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:52.875
Why do you look dumbfounded?
This is you, right?

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:54.916
-That's not me.
-It's not you?

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:58.583
This is your photo.

01:02:58.666 --> 01:03:00.125
The name says Nelson Mandela.

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.541
This isn't you?

01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:03.375
It's someone else who looks like me.

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:05.291
-Someone else?
-What is he saying?

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:07.291
It is him.

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:14.500
Sir, I swear… I just wanted to
deposit some money in the post office.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:17.208
It was Thenmozhi
who applied for these things.

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:20.083
I have nothing to do with this card.

01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:21.916
What's going on?

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:24.708
Don't you believe me?
I will tear it--

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:26.791
-No, don't do that!
-No!

01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:29.166
Get your hands off me!

01:03:30.166 --> 01:03:31.541
-Don't tear it.
-Don't stop me!

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:34.666
-We are glad you got a voter ID!
-Don't tear it!

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:37.958
What's with him?

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.750
You get to vote in this election.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:43.000
We are here to know
whom you'd be voting for.

01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:46.375
Who would stand in a queue
under the hot sun to cast a vote!

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:47.708
How can you say that?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.541
Every citizen must vote.

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.125
And you are a native of this village.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:52.250
You must vote!

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:53.666
-Is that so?
-Yeah!

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.125
My symbol is Road Roller.

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:56.500
My symbol is Coconut.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:58.750
Whom are you going to vote for?

01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:00.500
What a question to ask!

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:03.583
If I vote for one of you,
won't the other person feel bad?

01:04:03.666 --> 01:04:05.208
I'll cast one vote each.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.083
You can vote for only one person.

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:10.041
This is exactly why I said
I'm not going to vote!

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.416
Let me rip that card to pieces.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.541
Don't get angry.

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:15.583
Vote for whomever you think
will make a good leader.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.458
What does a good leader mean?

01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:19.083
A good leader…

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:22.250
Well, a leader is…

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.375
Think.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.083
A good leader is someone
who understands your needs.

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:29.875
You tell me.
What are your needs?

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.125
My needs are simple.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.125
I just want all of you
to grow a lot of hair

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.625
so that I can always give you a haircut.
That's all I need.

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:39.083
How is that enough?
When are you going to make it big?

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:40.625
Come here.

01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:44.083
-Where he is taking him?
-This is our salon!

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:47.208
Look at this mirror.
The mercury has completely worn off.

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:50.041
How will you make it big
with a mirror like this?

01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:52.833
Kaalai…

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.875
Step aside.

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:58.750
Make way.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.750
A brand new mirror just for just shaving?

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.500
It's the least I could do for you.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.000
Do you get it now?

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.083
A good leader understands your needs.

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:20.250
I get it.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.875
So, will you vote for me?

01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:23.000
I will definitely…

01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:24.708
Make way!

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.125
Take that away.

01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:41.583
You look speechless.

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:44.291
Being able to see
their faces is not enough.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:47.416
A customer should have
a comfortable experience.

01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:49.791
-Try it out.
-It's okay, sir.

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:51.125
Just sit!

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:53.000
-Come on! Sit.
-Sir…

01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:54.791
Come on, sit.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:58.416
How is it?

01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:00.250
It's so comfortable!

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.541
Tell us now,
who are you going to vote for?

01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:09.958
Well…

01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:14.583
I can't decide.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:17.500
Stop treating him like an equal!

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:18.916
He will vote as he is told.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.166
Our symbol is the Coconut.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:22.583
You will vote for it.

01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:24.958
-If you vote for someone else…
-Hey!

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:27.541
Did you just threaten him?

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:29.791
Do you think
no one will stand up for him?

01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:31.333
Don't run your mouth!

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:34.791
Who do you think he is?
Do you have any idea?

01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:37.208
He is the one who toils
for the village.

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:40.500
Should any harm befall him,
the Southerners will not spare you!

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:42.625
This is his vote.

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.500
He should decide
whom he wants to vote for.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.041
You fool!
Is that how you speak to him?

01:06:49.166 --> 01:06:50.416
He is one of our own.

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.625
Who else would he vote for if not us?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.458
Mandela, you need not
decide right away.

01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:57.041
The election is a month away.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:59.000
Take your time
and think this through.

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:00.083
Okay?

01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:03.875
Let's go.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:10.666
You must wear this on you
at all times.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.208
Keep it safe.

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.750
How could he slap
his own brother-in-law?

01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:17.166
What did you expect?

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:20.708
The fate of this election
lies in Mandela's hands now.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.875
This vote is a real godsend.
We must not let it go.

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:37.000
One of our men should always
keep an eye on Smile.

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:40.333
Whatever those people do,
we need to match them.

01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:52.416
Hey, look over there.

01:07:56.458 --> 01:08:02.458
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

<i>Your shop under the tree</i>
<i>Is now a salon with a seat</i>

01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:41.416
You'll vote for Road Roller, right?

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:43.625
I can't decide.

01:08:43.708 --> 01:08:45.833
It's okay. Take your time.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.833
Let's go.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:54.083
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

Cutting and shaving!

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:06.541
Hey, Jackass! Get me groceries
from the ration store.

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:08.791
Who are you ordering around?

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:12.416
What?

01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:19.000
Give it to him.

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.375
Side Burn, do you want to eat?

01:09:25.458 --> 01:09:27.875
I'd rather beg for alms than eat that.

01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:29.875
I'll take it.

01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:38.708
I've not made up my mind yet.

01:09:40.416 --> 01:09:41.625
Let's go.

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:48.666
<i>Yesterday, he was just Jackass</i>
<i>But now, he bathes and he is kickass</i>

01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:53.708
I couldn't decide.

<i>When he gives you a shave</i>

<i>He's got the power</i>

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.166
<i>Show him your voter's card</i>
<i>Are you a voting God?</i>

01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:17.375
Use the front door.

-Haircut or a shave?
-As you please.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.083

He can't read!

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.458
No, sir. It's not like that.

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:08.750
I'm trying to connect the call,
but I can't get a signal.

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:10.333
Yes, sir. I'm on the way…

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:11.875
Where are you going?

01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:14.500
If I don't attend this conference call,
they will fire me.

01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:16.291
Whatever!
Do it after the elections.

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:17.583
-Go back.
-Go.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.333
Go on!

01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:25.083
Mandela just won't
arrive at a decision.

01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:26.750
I heard he listens to you.

01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:28.875
Make him vote for us.

01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:30.875
And I will give you your cut.

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.083
Goodbye.

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:37.958
What is all this?

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.833
I got these for my vote.

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:42.083
Did you work to earn this?

01:11:42.166 --> 01:11:43.375
These are just freebies.

01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:44.875
Return all of it.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.041
Why should I?

01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:48.083
Everyone takes freebies.
I'm doing the same.

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:49.375
I'm not giving it back.

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.291
Side Burn, turn on the TV.

01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:57.000
Get lost.
I'm not touching your freebies.

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:01.250
Smile!

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.541
Smile!

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.166
Come, let's go to work.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:15.583
I won't ask for much.
It's just 10 rupees.

01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:18.083
With one vote,
you entered through the front door.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:20.125
Next, you'll make
your bed in my house.

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:22.625
It's okay.
I can do it myself.

01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:30.708
Hey, Mandela!

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:37.125
The leader needs a shave.
Come home.

01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:51.541
I don't need it.
You can leave.

01:12:51.916 --> 01:12:53.541
Then wash it off yourself.

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:03.125
Where are you girls going?

01:13:03.333 --> 01:13:04.541
We came to relieve ourselves.

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:06.125
Not at this time.
Go back home.

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.625
-This is Southern booze.
-This is Northern booze.

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:13.416
Get drunk and make a sober decision!

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:26.041
I've decided.

01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:30.500
I've decided to drink only
imported booze from now.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:33.208
<i>We're all scoundrels here!</i>

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:34.458
Hold tight!

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:37.333
No matter what we give him,
he says he can't decide.

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:39.750
He knows everyone gets these freebies.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:43.458
He will be able to decide
only if we give him what he really needs.

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:45.958
Find out what he needs
and give it to him.

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.958
Sir, do you need a shave?

01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:54.375
They will get it done on time.

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:58.208
<i>From cutting and shaving under the tree</i>
<i>To a salon with a stylish chair</i>

01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:02.291
<i>The small fish who went after the meat</i>
<i>Is now trapped in the net</i>

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:03.916
Where are you going?

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:05.875
I'm talking to you.

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.708
What do you care?

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:13.333
Go on! You will end up
coming back to me.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.041
Hey, Mandela!

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:23.666
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.916
Promise me that
you will vote for Coconut.

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.541
-I promise--
-So, you have built a salon!

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:35.625
Bring it in. Come on.

01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:37.875
Watch it!
Don't hit the gentleman.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.166
Come on.

01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:56.041
I swear, I can't decide.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:59.083
<i>His name is Mandela</i>

01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:05.666
Cutting and shaving!

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.041
Magesh?

01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:08.791
Magesh!

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:10.375
Do you want a haircut?

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:14.291
How about an oil massage?

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:15.708
No, thanks.

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:20.000
No one is coming!

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:22.125
Esaki, at least you come.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:25.500
I've opened a new salon.
No one has turned up all day.

01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:28.000
My hands are itching to work.

01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:30.541
You need not pay. It's free.

01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:38.166
BARBER SHOP
SOORANGUDI

01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:45.250
Come out, Mandela!

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:48.583
You think you're the only one
who gets to vote? Some vote!

01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:50.083
Do our votes not count?

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:51.708
What's your problem?

01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:52.833
Welcome.

01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:57.375
We get a pittance of 20 rupees
for our votes…

01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:59.958
but he gets a new salon!

01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:01.166
A new watch.

01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:03.125
He gets to eat
meat and rice every single day.

01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:04.666
I'm not going to vote either.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:07.250
I want all these things as well.

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.500
I can't decide either.

01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:12.666
Our people are working so hard
to win the election,

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:15.500
and you are causing trouble
instead of helping them?

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:17.041
Go home!

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.125
You talk rubbish when you are drunk.

01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:27.083
Thenmozhi, only you are ignoring me.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.833
Did you see how these people
stood up for me?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.041
You named me Mandela,
and it's gotten me so much respect.

01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:36.125
Oh! You thought this respect
was meant for you?

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.125
It's meant for your vote.

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:41.500
They will discard you
after the elections.

01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:42.625
So what?

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:45.875
I will earn as much as I can
with my vote.

01:16:46.125 --> 01:16:48.291
Do you know the value of a vote?

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:50.541
I know!
It's worth a salon.

01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:57.458
You are taking money from both sides.
Who are you going to vote for?

01:16:57.625 --> 01:16:59.500
You are too naive to know
how things work these days.

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:01.541
I will take handouts
from both the parties,

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:04.833
and on the voting day,
I'll blindly vote for some party.

01:17:06.833 --> 01:17:09.000
How many times have you voted, sir?

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.500
Never.

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:13.416
Do you even know how to vote?

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:14.875
I don't know.

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.375
You don't know how to vote.

01:17:16.458 --> 01:17:20.000
But you know everything
about making money with that vote!

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:27.250
A fully grown adult, who doesn't
know to vote, sucking on a lollipop.

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:30.333
At least he told us now
that he doesn't know how to vote.

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:31.916
Mandela, come here.

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:35.416
-Let's say he is the presiding officer.
-Hello, sir.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.208
If you show him your voter ID,

01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:39.166
he will verify your
name in the voter list,

01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.750
and send you ahead.

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:43.666
He applies the ink.
Show him your hand.

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.083
The other side up!

01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:48.625
This is the most important stage.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.416
He will give you four chits of paper.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.458
Only one of these chits
is for the president.

01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:57.166
You apply this seal on the symbol
you want to vote for…

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.125
fold it up,
and drop it into that box.

01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:01.708
-Is that all?
-Yes.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.625
Do people feel lazy just to do this?

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.208
Indeed. What can I say?

01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:06.416
Here, have a go.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.666
Are you trying to fool me?

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:14.750
Why do you say that?

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:16.958
-You say only two people are contesting.
-Yes.

01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:19.333
But there is a third person.
He didn't give me any money!

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:20.541
A third person?

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:23.291
That is NOTA!

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.625
I don't care who he is,
I'll vote only if I get paid.

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:28.166
He can't come begging
to me on election day.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:29.750
Of course.
Go ahead.

01:18:30.458 --> 01:18:31.541
Who will he vote for?

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.166
Road Roller, of course.

01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:45.791
Yeah, right!

01:18:45.958 --> 01:18:47.083
He is naive.

01:18:47.166 --> 01:18:50.250
And you are trying to trick him
into voting for Road Roller!

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.416
Drag him in here.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.041
Why would we trick him?

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:55.750
After all that we have done,
he will definitely vote for us.

01:18:55.833 --> 01:18:58.041
We have also done a lot for him!
His vote is ours.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.291
We get his vote.

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:02.541
-Let go of him!
-Leave him!

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.541
Esaki, grab him.
Secure our vote.

01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:06.583
How can you claim his vote?

01:19:06.666 --> 01:19:08.083
Why, is it written?

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.750
Yes, it is written.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.208
What can you do?

01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:15.250
This vote is ours.
Don't let him go.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.916
So, is he that "one vote"?

01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:47.583
What is your name?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.250
-Mandela.
-What?

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:51.708
Nelson Mandela.

01:19:52.333 --> 01:19:54.916
-Is he a foreigner?
-No, he is an Indian!

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:56.500
It's a long story.

01:19:57.666 --> 01:19:59.625
You say he isn't going to budge.

01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:02.041
You have decided to spend for the vote.

01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:04.958
Why don't you conduct an auction?

01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:06.458
An auction?

01:20:06.541 --> 01:20:09.250
Yes, auction his vote.

01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:12.333
Whoever wins the bid
becomes the next president.

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:16.208
The other person should
concede defeat, okay?

01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:18.291
What do you say?

01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:20.041
Do you agree?

01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:24.541
Isn't it against the law
to auction a vote?

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:27.750
Sure! Like you are doing
everything else by the book.

01:20:29.416 --> 01:20:32.083
What are you waiting for?
Get to work.

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:34.041
-Okay.
-We'll take your leave.

01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:35.291
-See you.
-See you.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.541
Hey, Africa!

01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:42.666
Take the money from the auction,
and vote without causing any trouble.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.041
-Understood?
-Yes.

01:20:44.416 --> 01:20:45.458
Get going.

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.500
Why are you dragging this out?

01:20:48.833 --> 01:20:51.750
Just tell one of them not to contest,
end of story.

01:20:54.166 --> 01:20:56.375
You are only thinking
about the local election.

01:20:56.458 --> 01:20:57.958
If we antagonize one group..

01:20:58.416 --> 01:21:01.625
we will never get their community's votes
anywhere in the state.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:05.125
But in this case, we will get
the factory irrespective of who wins.

01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:07.583
Let them fight among themselves.

01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:11.458
Did Shanmugam bring in money?

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:15.000
This should be enough.
I don't think they will bid higher.

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:17.708
Here, take this too.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:19.041
What is this for?

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.958
We saved this for the baby.

01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:23.041
But the baby will be born a millionaire.

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.708
I will invest whatever it takes
to get this done.

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:29.208
While we are still trying
to work out the figures,

01:21:29.291 --> 01:21:31.083
she has it all figured out!

01:21:34.041 --> 01:21:35.625
Why do you seem upset?

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:37.458
We will definitely win.

01:21:37.541 --> 01:21:40.291
Even if we don't win,
we shouldn't let them win.

01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:43.875
Despite that, if they end up
winning the auction--

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:45.375
They won't win!

01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:46.583
Suppose if they win…

01:21:46.791 --> 01:21:48.875
chop off Mandela's arm
after the auction.

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:51.583
-Brother-in-law…
-Won't you do it for our caste?

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:53.208
I will!

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:04.583
-Really, an auction?
-Yes.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.666
What's that bag for?

01:22:54.791 --> 01:22:58.208
I brought it to take my winnings
from the auction.

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.291
Make way.

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:03.250
Is everyone here?

01:23:03.375 --> 01:23:05.583
Hurry up, I need to go
to another auction after this.

01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:06.666
Lay it out.

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:08.750
Let's get this over with.

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:12.333
Place the item on the table.

01:23:12.916 --> 01:23:14.208
-Item?
-I don't know…

01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:15.625
The item!

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.041
You grab the other side.

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.291
-What?
-The item for auction.

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:26.750
You can't auction a person!

01:23:26.833 --> 01:23:29.583
We don't want to auction him,
but his vote.

01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:31.250
-Auction his vote?
-Yes.

01:23:31.416 --> 01:23:36.125
I'm here because the MLA wanted
a neutral party to hold the auction.

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:38.541
Are you trying to
land me in prison?

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:40.500
This is not right.
I'm leaving.

01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:47.416
Boss, I've been here for four weeks now.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.875
They won't even let me
set foot outside the village.

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:52.416
You've hardly been here for five minutes.
You think you can leave already?

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500
Go on. Get the auction going!

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:04.125
I've never auctioned a vote till now.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.000
Fine, name your price.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.875
What is a good amount
for your vote?

01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:09.791
Maybe 1000 rupees?

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:11.875
2000 rupees?

01:24:13.958 --> 01:24:15.041
Maybe 10,000 rupees.

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:16.125
10,000 rupees?

01:24:16.208 --> 01:24:19.208
People out there are desperate
to get 500 rupees for their votes,

01:24:19.291 --> 01:24:20.833
and you want 10,000 rupees!

01:24:20.916 --> 01:24:22.125
One lakh rupees!

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:24.833
One and a half lakh rupees!

01:24:28.333 --> 01:24:29.583
Who are you?

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:30.916
Mandela.

01:24:31.416 --> 01:24:32.541
I run a salon.

01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:35.916
I can also give a good shave.

01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:37.958
Go away.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:41.958
One and a half lakhs
from the South.

01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.166
Two lakhs.

01:24:43.958 --> 01:24:45.416
Two lakhs from the North.

01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:48.583
Two lakhs, anybody?

01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:50.291
Two and a half lakhs.

01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:52.333
They are going to
chop off your arm!

01:24:52.416 --> 01:24:54.833
-Two and a half lakhs from the South.
-My watch?

01:24:54.916 --> 01:24:56.416
-I'll give you later
-Three lakhs.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.041
Three lakhs from the North.

01:24:58.166 --> 01:25:01.083
The Northerners have
decided to chop off your arm

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:03.000
if they lose the auction.

01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:05.500
-What are you saying?
-Look over there.

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:07.250
Four lakhs.

01:25:07.333 --> 01:25:08.875
-Four lakhs from--
-Five lakhs!

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.916
These Northerners are despicable!

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.625
I'm voting for Road Roller.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.208
It was their idea to
chop off your arm first.

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:17.625
Anyone raising?

01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:19.541
Five lakhs from the South.

01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.166
-Six lakhs!
-What do we do?

01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:23.750
How would I know?

01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:26.041
I will figure something out.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.291
Just keep the auction going.

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:31.958
Or you will have to give a shave
with a single arm.

01:25:32.416 --> 01:25:33.958
Seven lakhs from North.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.875
Eight and a half lakh rupees.

01:25:36.541 --> 01:25:38.375
Eight and a half lakh from the South.

01:25:38.458 --> 01:25:40.166
North, are you going to raise?

01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:41.083
Nine lakhs.

01:25:41.166 --> 01:25:42.875
Nine lakhs from the North.

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:43.916
North…

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.708
Hey! Where are you going?

01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:46.625
To pee.

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.375
Wait till the auction is done.

01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:50.041
What's the tearing hurry?

01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:51.250
Seriously!

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.833
Take your time,
I'll be right here.

01:25:53.916 --> 01:25:54.916
Be seated.

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.625
Fifteen lakhs.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:25:58.000
Fifteen lakhs from the South.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:03.291
Fifteen lakhs from the South.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:04.541
Anyone raising?

01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:06.333
Seventeen lakhs!

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.541
Seventeen lakhs from the North.

01:26:08.625 --> 01:26:11.041
Seventeen lakhs from the North.

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:13.000
-Eighteen lakhs.
-Eighteen lakhs!

01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:15.291
Eighteen lakhs from the South.

01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:17.208
Eighteen lakhs from the South.

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:19.583
Hey! Why are you
dancing over there?

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.125
Grooving about when
an auction's underway!

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:23.583
He thinks I'm dancing?

01:26:24.916 --> 01:26:27.000
-Continue.
-Eighteen lakhs from the South.

01:26:27.083 --> 01:26:28.500
Eighteen lakhs from the South.

01:26:28.625 --> 01:26:30.166
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand.

01:26:30.541 --> 01:26:32.875
Twenty lakhs and eleven
thousand from the North.

01:26:33.583 --> 01:26:34.833
Anyone raising?

01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:39.916
Mandela, get that bell.

01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:45.916
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand
from the North, calling once.

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:49.583
Sir, they are auctioning Smile's vote.

01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:51.708
They will never learn.

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:54.375
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand
from the North, calling twice.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:57.583
Whoever loses the auction has decided
to chop off Smile's arm.

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.583
Sir?

01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:06.916
Sir!

01:27:07.625 --> 01:27:09.041
It will be over now.

01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:11.791
Twenty lakhs and eleven thousand…

01:27:12.375 --> 01:27:15.250
It can't be over.
You took the Southerners for misers?

01:27:15.416 --> 01:27:17.958
If they lose this auction,
how will the village respect them?

01:27:18.041 --> 01:27:20.666
The Southerners aren't suckers
to be defeated by the Northerners.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:22.500
-Am I right, bro?
-That's right.

01:27:22.708 --> 01:27:24.583
Mathi, don't give up. Raise!

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:29.958
-Include that bungalow…
-Okay

01:27:30.041 --> 01:27:31.333
Make way.

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:35.208
A bungalow?

01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:37.916
A bungalow from the South.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.166
Thirty-five lakhs!

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:44.041
Forty-five lakhs!

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.250
Forty-five lakhs from the North.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:49.833
Sixty lakhs!

01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:51.125
Sixty lakhs from the South.

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.791
Sixty lakhs, calling once.

01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:56.458
Sixty lakhs, calling twice.

01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:58.291
-Sixty lakhs--
-Sir, hold on.

01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:01.041
Is that the best
the Northerners can do?

01:28:01.125 --> 01:28:02.791
I was going to vote for the North.

01:28:02.875 --> 01:28:04.833
If you want to save face,
raise the bid.

01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:06.750
Our caste is not inferior to theirs!

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.458
Raise the bid.
The North is counting on you.

01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:10.666
Raise it!

01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:13.291
How much have you got
in your pockets?

01:28:14.666 --> 01:28:15.833
Two rupees.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:18.041
How much property has he declared?

01:28:18.166 --> 01:28:19.166
Forty-five lakhs.

01:28:20.083 --> 01:28:22.416
Think about why you don't have
the kind of money he does.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.000
This is not the time to think!

01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:26.875
Our caste needs a win.
Raise it!

01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:40.625
Your vote is worth upwards of a crore?

01:28:41.791 --> 01:28:43.750
When you filed your nominations,

01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:47.125
you declared your assets as
50,000 rupees and a rickety old cycle!

01:28:47.458 --> 01:28:49.750
But you are pouring in crores now!

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:53.916
Now, it's one crore
and ten lakhs from the North,

01:28:55.083 --> 01:28:57.833
and one crore and
twenty-five lakhs from the South.

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:02.583
One crore and twenty-five lakhs
from the South, going once.

01:29:05.708 --> 01:29:08.708
One crore and twenty-five lakhs
from the South, going twice.

01:29:17.333 --> 01:29:19.875
One crore and twenty-five lakhs
from the South--

01:29:19.958 --> 01:29:21.125
Stop!

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.625
What?

01:29:25.708 --> 01:29:26.583
The leader…

01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:28.041
What happened?

01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:29.375
He is dead.

01:29:29.541 --> 01:29:30.625
He is dead?

01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:32.458
What are you saying?

01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:33.625
Oh, no!

01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:35.625
Start the car!

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.458
Where are you going?

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:40.583
To see the leader.

01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:42.000
-Sir, what happened?
-Sir!

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:44.083
-Sir, we are here!
-Sir, what happened?

01:29:44.208 --> 01:29:45.625
They are telling something…

01:29:45.708 --> 01:29:47.250
-Are you okay?
-Sir.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.500
He is still breathing.

01:29:52.708 --> 01:29:54.666
-What did you say?
-I didn't understand.

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:56.458
This is our chance.
Let's escape.

01:29:56.541 --> 01:29:59.375
I must pay my respects to the leader!

01:29:59.583 --> 01:30:01.541
You fool! He isn't dead.

01:30:01.625 --> 01:30:02.708
I just bluffed.

01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:03.958
Come with me if you want!

01:30:04.041 --> 01:30:06.250
You bluffed? Wait!

01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:07.541
Sir?

01:30:07.708 --> 01:30:08.625
Nagging…

01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:10.625
He is nagging you?

01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:11.958
Can't understand, sir

01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:13.583
Who?

01:30:13.916 --> 01:30:14.875
Not me?

01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:16.916
-Nagging…
-Who is nagging?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.041
What is he saying?

01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:20.916
He wants to watch <i>Naagini</i> on TV.
Move aside.

01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:31.541
-They tricked us!
-Start the car!

01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:33.416
Don't let those scoundrels
leave the village!

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.583
Let's go.

01:31:09.916 --> 01:31:11.708
Please wait for a moment, sir.

01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:13.958
Hurry up, man! Run faster!

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:42.541
You thought you could run away
with all our money?

01:31:42.708 --> 01:31:46.166
-It's my money!
-Spare him. He made a mistake.

01:31:47.333 --> 01:31:50.583
-Mathi, don't spare him. Thrash him!
-Sir, please leave him.

01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:52.625
Are you trying to flee the village?

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:55.125
He almost got away.
Beat him up!

01:31:55.208 --> 01:31:57.625
-Lift him up.
-Beat him to death.

01:31:59.666 --> 01:32:02.083
Sir, please stop them!

01:32:02.166 --> 01:32:05.666
You are just a stray who eats our
leftovers. You made us touch your feet!

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:11.625
I'm going to vote for NOTA.

01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:13.166
NOTA?

01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.750
If you vote for NOTA,
we will have a re-election.

01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:17.916
We will make one of our men
contest again.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.625
You will be in the same situation.

01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:22.333
How dare you take our money
and decide to vote for NOTA?

01:32:23.208 --> 01:32:25.208
-Hit him!
-You'll vote for NOTA!

01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:26.666
Hit him on the face!

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:31.333
Screw the auction.
We've given him enough.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.375
I need to know right now
which one of us he will vote for.

01:32:34.625 --> 01:32:36.666
Who will you vote for? Tell me.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.458
-Answer me.
-Answer!

01:32:40.375 --> 01:32:41.666
Answer me!

01:32:41.958 --> 01:32:43.250
I can't decide.

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:44.583
Can't decide?

01:32:44.666 --> 01:32:46.875
-Don't hit him.
-He has been saying this forever.

01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:49.833
You gave him all those things
because you wanted his vote.

01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:51.166
You dogs!

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.250
Why are you hitting him now?
Let him go!

01:32:53.875 --> 01:32:57.250
He won't respond to words.
I'll slaughter him right here.

01:32:57.333 --> 01:32:58.375
Leave me

01:32:58.625 --> 01:33:00.708
-Leave me!
-Calm down!

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:04.625
What about all the money
we have already spent?

01:33:05.083 --> 01:33:08.666
Let's sort it out after the election.
Spare this scoundrel for now.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:11.666
Hey! You have two days.

01:33:11.875 --> 01:33:15.083
Decide and tell us
who you are voting for.

01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:23.916
Didn't you say the leader died?

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.666
Mandela?

01:34:44.166 --> 01:34:45.375
Ignore him.

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.541
Side Burn…

01:35:16.625 --> 01:35:17.625
Side Burn!

01:35:24.166 --> 01:35:25.041
Side Burn!

01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:32.250
Hey! Side Burn!

01:35:34.458 --> 01:35:35.500
Side Burn!

01:35:45.833 --> 01:35:48.375
-Sir, Side Burn is dying--
-Get off my stairs.

01:35:50.333 --> 01:35:53.708
-Tell me.
-Side Burn is dying. Please save him.

01:35:56.666 --> 01:35:58.791
Just come back inside!

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Sir…

01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:03.458
It's easy for you.

01:36:03.541 --> 01:36:05.208
You make miracles happen
with that vote.

01:36:05.291 --> 01:36:08.333
I'm sure you know how to
use your vote to save him.

01:36:11.458 --> 01:36:12.500
Sir!

01:36:13.291 --> 01:36:14.541
Mr. Rathinam!

01:36:15.791 --> 01:36:17.083
Please help me.

01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.333
Sir!

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.625
Side Burn is dying.
We need to take him to a hospital.

01:36:26.708 --> 01:36:27.875
Please help me, sir.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.625
Who is that?

01:36:30.208 --> 01:36:31.958
The kid who said that the leader died?

01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:33.250
Yes.

01:36:34.666 --> 01:36:35.916
How old is he?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.041
He's 15 years old.

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.458
So, he doesn't get to vote?

01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:42.458
Then why on earth
should we save him?

01:36:42.541 --> 01:36:43.833
Please don't say that.

01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:46.291
I will do as you say.

01:36:46.916 --> 01:36:48.375
Please save the kid, sir.

01:36:48.458 --> 01:36:49.875
You would do anything I say?

01:36:50.291 --> 01:36:52.750
I will, sir.
I will lay down my life for you.

01:36:54.083 --> 01:36:55.666
I have no use for your life.

01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:57.875
Will you vote for me?

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:05.500
I will.

01:37:05.583 --> 01:37:06.708
Save the kid.

01:37:07.958 --> 01:37:09.708
He can't be trusted.

01:37:09.833 --> 01:37:12.708
He may go back on his word
and say he can't decide.

01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:15.041
Will you swear upon
your shaving kit?

01:37:41.416 --> 01:37:42.333
Sir!

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:45.000
I swear…

01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:54.083
I dare you to do that!

01:37:54.291 --> 01:37:55.875
Do you take us for idiots?

01:37:55.958 --> 01:37:58.416
He is trying to cut a deal
in the middle of the night!

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.458
Sir, the boy is fighting for his life.

01:38:01.541 --> 01:38:03.291
Can you take him to the hospital?

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:05.375
I will vote for you.

01:38:09.625 --> 01:38:11.666
Taking him to the hospital
is no big deal.

01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:14.708
But will you really vote for us?

01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:16.291
I will!

01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:19.125
Take him to the hospital.

01:38:19.208 --> 01:38:20.500
-I can--
-Fine!

01:38:20.958 --> 01:38:24.166
I feel sorry for you.
I will save his life.

01:38:27.083 --> 01:38:28.833
You will vote for me?

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:30.625
Definitely, sir!

01:38:31.541 --> 01:38:33.708
You wouldn't vote for
Road Roller, right?

01:38:35.583 --> 01:38:36.875
-I won't.
-Hey!

01:38:37.166 --> 01:38:38.833
Do I look like a fool to you?

01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:42.125
Don't let this scoundrel
set foot outside the village.

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:45.041
If you promise to vote for them,

01:38:45.333 --> 01:38:47.625
I'll make sure the boy doesn't live.

01:38:47.958 --> 01:38:48.958
Let's go.

01:38:53.166 --> 01:38:54.250
Mandela!

01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:57.375
First, decide who gets your vote.

01:38:57.541 --> 01:39:00.375
Then we can think about
saving a boy who can't even vote.

01:39:00.583 --> 01:39:02.750
Sir, please help me.

01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:05.958
Sir?

01:39:11.166 --> 01:39:13.875
Sir, I hope at least you will help us.

01:39:14.333 --> 01:39:15.416
Sir!

01:39:16.875 --> 01:39:18.833
Sir, think of him like your son.

01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:21.458
He is fighting for his life.

01:39:42.625 --> 01:39:44.083
Side Burn!

01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:04.666
<i>Even when the days</i>

01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:08.833
<i>Turn dark</i>

01:40:10.083 --> 01:40:13.333
<i>Our dreams</i>

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.416
<i>Can never be dark</i>

01:40:17.958 --> 01:40:23.916
<i>Even when the wings are clipped</i>

01:40:25.916 --> 01:40:28.666
<i>Our hearts will never shatter</i>

01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:30.083
Come here, quick!

01:40:32.041 --> 01:40:33.250
Thenmozhi!

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:35.666
<i>O Mandela!</i>

01:40:37.666 --> 01:40:42.041
<i>Like a shining light on dark days</i>

01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:45.500
<i>O Mandela!</i>

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.791
<i>Like a ray of hope for shattered hearts</i>

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.250
<i>O Mandela!</i>

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.750
<i>Like a rising tide</i>

01:40:57.833 --> 01:41:00.083
<i>O Mandela!</i>

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.416
<i>Like a shift in direction</i>

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:08.041
<i>O Mandela!</i>

01:41:09.666 --> 01:41:13.000
<i>Like a shining light on dark days</i>

01:41:13.083 --> 01:41:16.708
She won't help him for nothing.
He must have promised her a share.

01:41:17.416 --> 01:41:20.250
Or why would anyone be
associated with someone like him?

01:41:20.333 --> 01:41:22.333
Whatever!
What do we care?

01:41:22.416 --> 01:41:25.250
<i>O Mandela!</i>

01:41:26.083 --> 01:41:29.375
<i>The rising tide</i>

01:41:29.458 --> 01:41:31.750
Thenmozhi, how is he?

01:41:32.708 --> 01:41:34.416
Have you admitted him in a hospital?

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.041
What did the doctor say?

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:38.500
Will he be alright?

01:41:40.083 --> 01:41:42.416
Thenmozhi, I am talking to you.

01:41:46.458 --> 01:41:48.375
I'm talking to you,
why won't you answer?

01:41:48.458 --> 01:41:50.500
Why should I answer?

01:41:50.625 --> 01:41:53.208
You didn't just ruin your life
with your one vote.

01:41:53.291 --> 01:41:54.958
You also ruined Side Burn's life!

01:41:55.041 --> 01:41:57.708
I'm ashamed to have named
a man like you after Mandela!

01:41:58.583 --> 01:42:00.708
Why are you even alive,
you wretched man?

01:42:01.083 --> 01:42:02.583
Just go and die!

01:42:02.708 --> 01:42:04.125
Rid us of that one vote.

01:42:04.208 --> 01:42:08.166
<i>Mandela!</i>

01:42:10.833 --> 01:42:13.500
Not just shaving.
I will do any work you give me.

01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:16.000
The villagers have decided
not to give you any work.

01:42:16.083 --> 01:42:18.208
I can't defy their orders.

01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:25.000
Grandma!

01:42:26.041 --> 01:42:27.375
-Give that to me.
-No, thanks.

01:42:27.458 --> 01:42:30.333
I will get into trouble
if I'm seen taking your help.

01:42:30.541 --> 01:42:31.875
I'll carry it myself.

01:43:01.916 --> 01:43:04.541
<i>I'm ashamed to have named</i>
<i>a man like you after Mandela!</i>

01:43:10.833 --> 01:43:12.583
<i>Why are you alive,</i>
<i>you wretched man?</i>

01:43:13.333 --> 01:43:16.833
<i>You should die!</i>
<i>Rid us of that one vote.</i>

01:43:46.625 --> 01:43:47.916
Who's there?

01:43:51.458 --> 01:43:52.666
Who is it?

01:43:53.666 --> 01:43:54.791
I'm talking to you.

01:43:58.208 --> 01:43:59.500
Don't come any closer.

01:44:00.416 --> 01:44:03.250
-Who are you?
-I am Vairamuthu, from the North.

01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:06.375
-What are you doing here?
-I came here to relieve myself.

01:44:07.958 --> 01:44:09.291
At this hour?

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:12.375
I can't come here after dawn
because the men would be here.

01:44:12.458 --> 01:44:14.166
So, I wake up at 3 a.m.
to relieve myself.

01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:16.708
But you shouldn't venture out
into the woods at this late hour.

01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:19.750
It's not just me.
This is what all the women do.

01:44:20.583 --> 01:44:22.333
They demolished that toilet as well.

01:44:22.416 --> 01:44:23.833
Where else can we go?

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:28.625
Brother?

01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:31.000
With that vote of yours…

01:44:31.458 --> 01:44:36.291
could you prevent men
from coming here to drink at night?

01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:15.791
What is it?

01:45:17.291 --> 01:45:20.166
-Do you want my vote?
-I do.

01:45:20.250 --> 01:45:22.875
I'm finding it hard
to go to the toilet in the woods.

01:45:22.958 --> 01:45:25.666
Rebuild the toilet that you demolished,

01:45:25.916 --> 01:45:27.416
and I will vote for you.

01:45:36.375 --> 01:45:38.625
You think you are some hero
to order me around?

01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:40.041
Don't mess with me. Go away.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:42.708
Fine, forget it.
I will relieve myself in your house.

01:45:46.041 --> 01:45:47.791
Don't hit him!

01:45:47.916 --> 01:45:49.583
Mathi, don't hit him.

01:45:51.041 --> 01:45:51.875
Get off him.

01:45:51.958 --> 01:45:53.083
Listen to me.

01:45:53.208 --> 01:45:54.708
Mathi, don't!

01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:57.416
Stop hitting him!

01:45:58.458 --> 01:45:59.791
Listen to me.

01:46:00.041 --> 01:46:02.000
You are just a stray
who shits where you eat!

01:46:02.083 --> 01:46:03.541
And you want to shit in my house?

01:46:03.625 --> 01:46:04.708
Calm down!

01:46:04.916 --> 01:46:07.875
Leave him alone!
He will die!

01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:11.875
I ran behind this scoundrel
just for the five crores!

01:46:11.958 --> 01:46:13.666
Don't talk nonsense now.

01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:14.833
Go away.

01:46:18.708 --> 01:46:21.458
Don't think you can order him around.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.416
He will kill you!

01:46:26.458 --> 01:46:28.625
Can't shit unless you have a toilet?

01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:36.625
Don't give that pest any food or water.

01:46:38.333 --> 01:46:40.375
Keep him locked up here
until the elections.

01:46:56.458 --> 01:46:59.166
Let's give him some water at least.
He might die.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.541
Did you beat up that African boy?

01:47:20.625 --> 01:47:22.250
I stopped at Rathinam's place.

01:47:22.333 --> 01:47:23.791
We just shoved him about.

01:47:23.916 --> 01:47:25.416
Shoved him?

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.500
What happens if he dies
before the election?

01:47:29.125 --> 01:47:30.291
Let him die.

01:47:30.458 --> 01:47:31.750
What are you saying?

01:47:31.875 --> 01:47:35.208
Whoever wins the elections
will get crores from the company.

01:47:35.291 --> 01:47:38.250
I don't care about the five crores.
I can't beg that scoundrel.

01:47:38.333 --> 01:47:40.208
They are willing to pay 30 crores!

01:47:42.375 --> 01:47:44.958
-Thirty crores?
-Yes, thirty crores!

01:47:45.666 --> 01:47:48.916
Beg that African, do whatever it takes,
and make him vote for you!

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.791
You can't lay a finger on him
till the elections.

01:47:52.875 --> 01:47:54.041
That's a warning.

01:47:54.125 --> 01:47:55.166
Let's go.

01:48:00.416 --> 01:48:02.125
God, I hope he is not dead.

01:48:21.583 --> 01:48:23.916
Son, pick that up.

01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:27.541
It's worth 30 crores.

01:48:28.916 --> 01:48:29.916
Take it, man.

01:48:37.791 --> 01:48:39.250
Where were we?

01:48:39.625 --> 01:48:41.083
-The toilet.
-Yes.

01:48:42.625 --> 01:48:44.833
I'm finding it hard
to go in the woods.

01:48:45.333 --> 01:48:47.708
Rebuild the toilet you demolished.

01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.041
If you don't want to,
that's okay.

01:48:53.375 --> 01:48:54.708
Rathinam!

01:48:54.875 --> 01:48:56.541
I have a vote.
Do you want it?

01:48:56.625 --> 01:48:57.708
I'll rebuild it.

01:49:03.208 --> 01:49:04.291
Alright!

01:49:26.625 --> 01:49:28.041
Everybody will get to use it.

01:49:33.375 --> 01:49:34.666
Hurry up.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.500
Grind the cement properly.

01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:44.833
Or he will make us rebuild it.

01:49:44.916 --> 01:49:47.541
He knows about the 30 crores.

01:49:47.625 --> 01:49:49.791
That's why they are
dancing to his tunes.

01:49:50.125 --> 01:49:51.916
If he knows we are in it
for the money,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.250
he won't obey us anymore.

01:49:54.916 --> 01:49:57.625
If he tries to walk over us,
we should walk over him.

01:49:58.125 --> 01:49:59.375
Or he won't budge.

01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:16.166
Is it burning?

01:50:16.791 --> 01:50:18.541
A low-born who doesn't even
know his own name!

01:50:18.625 --> 01:50:22.166
We burned on the inside
when you made us run behind you!

01:50:22.583 --> 01:50:25.208
The Southerners have no pride,
so they just played along.

01:50:25.291 --> 01:50:27.541
But don't try to get cocky
with a Northerner,

01:50:27.625 --> 01:50:28.916
or you will get burnt!

01:50:29.416 --> 01:50:31.416
It's very simple.
You will vote for us.

01:50:31.916 --> 01:50:33.083
How will I vote now?

01:50:33.166 --> 01:50:35.208
-Why?
-My voter ID is inside.

01:50:39.916 --> 01:50:42.000
Kaalai, get some water!

01:50:42.541 --> 01:50:44.041
Quick, get some water.

01:50:44.916 --> 01:50:48.041
Hurry up! It's burning.
Check the other side.

01:50:49.708 --> 01:50:52.000
-Thirty crores!
-Pour some water from that side.

01:50:52.083 --> 01:50:53.583
Pour some up there!

01:50:54.083 --> 01:50:55.791
Look for the card.

01:50:57.416 --> 01:50:58.666
Is it there?

01:51:01.041 --> 01:51:02.333
I hope it's not burnt.

01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:04.208
It's not in there.

01:51:04.291 --> 01:51:07.458
Just kidding.
I got it right here.

01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:10.041
Are you screwing with us?
I'll slit your throat!

01:51:10.125 --> 01:51:11.291
I dare you to do it.

01:51:11.416 --> 01:51:12.458
I dare you!

01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:14.375
If you kill me, who will
cast that swing vote?

01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:15.625
Tell me.

01:51:17.791 --> 01:51:19.250
You want my vote, right?

01:51:21.125 --> 01:51:23.041
Build me a swimming pool,
I'll vote for you.

01:51:23.125 --> 01:51:24.208
A swimming pool?

01:51:24.875 --> 01:51:27.291
People don't even have water
to wash their asses.

01:51:27.541 --> 01:51:29.500
Build it, and you get my vote.

01:51:29.583 --> 01:51:31.750
We can't build a swimming pool
in the village.

01:51:33.291 --> 01:51:35.291
You know the old water tank
in the village?

01:51:35.375 --> 01:51:39.083
Clean it up and fill it with water.
I'll take a dip in it.

01:51:39.375 --> 01:51:41.250
If you don't…

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.333
Get in! It's getting late.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.041
-I'm not in the mood.
-Not in the mood?

01:52:03.458 --> 01:52:05.750
We worked so hard
to fill the tank with water!

01:52:05.833 --> 01:52:07.666
What do we do with the water now?

01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:15.333
Open the pipeline.

01:52:15.416 --> 01:52:18.416
Fill it up with water every day.
I'll shower when I feel like it.

01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:21.833
<i>Mic testing! One, two, three!</i>

01:52:21.916 --> 01:52:25.000
<i>I have something to say to thee</i>

01:52:25.208 --> 01:52:28.250
<i>It's happening, it's coming true</i>

01:52:28.333 --> 01:52:31.250
<i>All our dreams are taking shape</i>

01:52:31.833 --> 01:52:35.833
Great! As though re-building the toilet
will make these people cultured.

01:52:36.125 --> 01:52:38.416
Why should we pay to build
a toilet for the Northerners?

01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:41.500
This is common property.
Southerners can also use it.

01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:44.250
I would rather die than
use a Northerner's toilet.

01:52:46.166 --> 01:52:47.458
He is a proud man.

01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:50.416
<i>Think before you cast your vote</i>

01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:53.916
<i>Gotta make it happen</i>
<i>Let's wreak havoc</i>

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
<i>If it doesn't work out</i>
<i>We must set it right</i>

01:52:57.125 --> 01:52:59.916
<i>There's a hullabaloo</i>
<i>Just for one man's vote</i>

01:53:00.083 --> 01:53:03.208
<i>Everyone's dancing to his tunes</i>

01:53:03.458 --> 01:53:06.291
<i>When the saboteurs come</i>

01:53:06.666 --> 01:53:08.958
<i>Close the gates shut!</i>

01:53:09.583 --> 01:53:12.458
I've always wished
to study in a school.

01:53:12.625 --> 01:53:14.208
You'll probably be dead in 20 days.

01:53:14.291 --> 01:53:16.500
Do you plan on
becoming a scholar by then?

01:53:16.625 --> 01:53:17.750
Don't give him ideas.

01:53:17.833 --> 01:53:21.333
Or he will demand that we make him
a scholar, in exchange for his vote.

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.958
Make me a scholar.
I will vote for you.

01:53:28.166 --> 01:53:29.583
Fix the school building.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:51.125
What about the money you owe me?

01:53:51.458 --> 01:53:52.666
No, thanks.

01:53:56.541 --> 01:53:57.833
Fifty rupees.

01:54:10.875 --> 01:54:12.416
Thirty rupees.

01:54:12.541 --> 01:54:14.166
Only Side Burn's money is left.

01:54:15.041 --> 01:54:16.250
No need.

01:54:25.916 --> 01:54:27.958
Stop, it hurts. I'll walk.

01:54:33.625 --> 01:54:36.458
At this rate, we may have to
shut down our company.

01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:48.666
You don't get it?

01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:51.375
He says he will vote for Road Roller
if you don't lay new roads.

01:54:51.458 --> 01:54:54.416
<i>There's a hullabaloo</i>
<i>Just for one man's vote</i>

01:54:54.541 --> 01:54:56.750
<i>Everyone's dancing to his tunes</i>

01:54:56.833 --> 01:54:58.750
Are you sure we'll get 30 crores?

01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:00.666
We must win at any cost!

01:55:01.916 --> 01:55:05.583
Great! As though re-building the school
will turn these people into geniuses.

01:55:09.041 --> 01:55:10.500
I've been watching you.

01:55:10.583 --> 01:55:13.083
You just go around brushing your teeth
and passing comments.

01:55:13.166 --> 01:55:14.833
Are you a Northerner or a Southerner?

01:55:14.916 --> 01:55:17.541
I'm from the neighboring village.
I come here to kill time.

01:55:17.625 --> 01:55:20.791
If I ever see you in Soorangudi again,
I will chop your nose off.

01:55:20.875 --> 01:55:22.541
Now, scram!

01:55:29.833 --> 01:55:34.375
<i>The young ones have matured</i>
<i>And come together</i>

01:55:35.166 --> 01:55:37.500
Get in.
Don't stand near the door.

01:55:37.583 --> 01:55:40.958
<i>The old codes have been discarded</i>
<i>As invalid for our times</i>

01:55:42.666 --> 01:55:48.541
<i>We will beg and plead for five years</i>
<i>When will we stand tall and survive?</i>

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:53.458
<i>Think for everyone</i>
<i>Fight for your descendants</i>

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:55.375
Study well, son.

01:55:55.458 --> 01:55:58.583
<i>Gotta make it last</i>
<i>Gotta stay strong</i>

01:55:58.708 --> 01:56:02.083
You have to give them credit!
The roads are so shiny.

01:56:02.416 --> 01:56:04.083
Thank God he didn't come to us!

01:56:04.583 --> 01:56:06.000
Stop!

01:56:10.333 --> 01:56:12.833
Why would you stand
in the middle of the road?

01:56:13.208 --> 01:56:14.708
What if a car had run you over?

01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:16.208
You would have lost my vote.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.375
Install streetlamps on all the roads.

01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:24.333
Our things are being removed
from the bar.

01:56:24.416 --> 01:56:26.541
Just need to hand over the keys.

01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:28.333
A little higher.

01:56:30.333 --> 01:56:33.125
You've been at it all day.
We have barely covered four streets.

01:56:33.416 --> 01:56:34.500
Hurry up!

01:57:16.208 --> 01:57:17.250
Here.

01:57:25.208 --> 01:57:26.458
Give me two buns.

01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:51.416
<i>In 20 districts including</i>
<i>Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Madurai</i>

01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:55.541
<i>village local body elections</i>
<i>begin tomorrow.</i>

01:57:55.625 --> 01:57:57.375
This is the last of my money.

01:57:58.583 --> 01:58:00.500
We can use this
to pay for the votes.

01:58:01.458 --> 01:58:03.333
But I have no money left.

01:58:04.416 --> 01:58:06.708
If Mandela doesn't vote for us,

01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:09.708
I will kill him
with my bare hands.

01:58:27.666 --> 01:58:29.166
Go inside.

01:58:36.833 --> 01:58:38.541
-Welcome, brother.
-Greetings.

01:58:58.791 --> 01:58:59.875
Is everything okay?

01:58:59.958 --> 01:59:01.333
The leader hasn't come?

01:59:03.083 --> 01:59:04.208
No.

01:59:17.625 --> 01:59:18.875
What are you doing?

01:59:19.541 --> 01:59:20.916
I was just looking at it.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.458
Keep it safe in your pocket.
2,000 rupees for a vote isn't nothing!

01:59:24.541 --> 01:59:25.708
Hurry up.

01:59:45.875 --> 01:59:47.000
Get in.

01:59:57.333 --> 01:59:59.083
-Why are we stopping here?
-Wait

01:59:59.208 --> 02:00:00.500
Where are you going?

02:00:02.708 --> 02:00:04.083
What's with this guy?

02:00:13.916 --> 02:00:16.375
Hey, what are you doing?

02:00:16.458 --> 02:00:17.791
Have you gone mad?

02:00:17.875 --> 02:00:21.791
Every single person in the village
will bring their 20 rupee token.

02:00:21.875 --> 02:00:24.750
We will be the only ones
turning up empty handed.

02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:40.125
Stop.

02:00:41.708 --> 02:00:43.083
Have you made up your mind?

02:00:45.166 --> 02:00:47.458
I will forgive everything
you have done.

02:00:47.541 --> 02:00:49.541
Give me your word
that you'll vote for me.

02:00:49.625 --> 02:00:51.666
I'll get you a good job in Singapore.

02:00:51.833 --> 02:00:53.041
What do you say?

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:54.916
You don't need to go to Singapore.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.541
Promise me that you will
vote for Coconut,

02:00:56.625 --> 02:00:58.625
and you will become
a Northerner right away.

02:00:59.958 --> 02:01:03.666
Mandela, your life and death
are in your own hands.

02:01:04.625 --> 02:01:05.541
Tell me.

02:01:05.625 --> 02:01:07.208
Who will you vote for?

02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:08.750
Answer me!

02:01:12.875 --> 02:01:14.208
It is my vote.

02:01:15.166 --> 02:01:17.125
I get to decide
whom I want to vote for.

02:01:18.375 --> 02:01:19.750
Get out of my way.

02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:33.375
What is your name?

02:01:33.458 --> 02:01:34.708
Nelson Mandela.

02:01:36.666 --> 02:01:38.708
Sir, this ID looks suspicious.

02:01:40.333 --> 02:01:43.458
His name on the card
is Nelson Mandela.

02:01:43.541 --> 02:01:47.416
The man himself looks suspicious.

02:01:47.541 --> 02:01:51.125
You have no idea about
the drama behind this one guy's vote.

02:01:51.208 --> 02:01:53.791
If he doesn't vote,
there will be hell to pay.

02:01:54.041 --> 02:01:56.500
-Can we send him ahead?
-Please do.

02:01:56.583 --> 02:01:57.666
Here.

02:02:02.666 --> 02:02:05.875
Sir, that finger is injured.
Apply the ink on the other finger.

02:02:19.708 --> 02:02:22.333
Step aside, everyone.
Please don't stand at the door.

02:02:37.375 --> 02:02:38.500
Come here.

02:02:38.625 --> 02:02:39.875
You scoundrel!

02:02:40.458 --> 02:02:42.083
Who did you vote for?

02:02:43.833 --> 02:02:44.958
Answer me!

02:02:48.125 --> 02:02:49.625
I voted for M.G.R.

02:02:50.041 --> 02:02:51.000
Calm down!

02:02:51.083 --> 02:02:54.000
You can see for yourself
when the results are out tomorrow.

02:02:54.291 --> 02:02:55.583
Why are you crowding there?

02:02:55.666 --> 02:02:57.166
You can't be here. Go away!

02:02:58.291 --> 02:03:00.083
How do I know
that you actually voted?

02:03:17.333 --> 02:03:18.541
I told you!

02:03:18.666 --> 02:03:20.875
Everyone has brought
their 20 rupee token.

02:03:21.125 --> 02:03:22.333
These are your people.

02:03:22.416 --> 02:03:25.291
Tell them you lost the token,
and try to get 2,000 rupees.

02:03:25.375 --> 02:03:26.291
One by one.

02:03:26.375 --> 02:03:27.375
Shut up!

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.833
Are you coming or not?

02:03:30.916 --> 02:03:32.166
-Hello!
-Brother…

02:03:32.250 --> 02:03:34.166
-Have you voted?
-Yes, brother.

02:03:36.875 --> 02:03:38.333
-Here.
-I don't want it.

02:03:38.416 --> 02:03:39.875
I voted for you.

02:03:40.083 --> 02:03:41.833
Then why did you bring the token?

02:03:41.916 --> 02:03:45.625
The 20 rupees belongs to you,
so I came to return it.

02:03:45.708 --> 02:03:46.750
I'll see you.

02:03:47.083 --> 02:03:48.000
Brother.

02:03:49.125 --> 02:03:51.250
My son is getting an education
because of this vote.

02:03:51.333 --> 02:03:53.500
It feels wrong to take money.

02:03:56.125 --> 02:03:57.291
Leave it there.

02:04:02.875 --> 02:04:04.083
Murugesan!

02:04:05.375 --> 02:04:06.541
I have voted, brother.

02:04:06.625 --> 02:04:08.250
But I don't want the money.

02:04:08.625 --> 02:04:10.250
I have voted.
I don't want the money.

02:04:10.333 --> 02:04:11.916
Here is your 20 rupees.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.208
With 20 rupees, you got
the entire village to vote!

02:04:14.291 --> 02:04:15.875
Are you happy now?
Go on.

02:04:15.958 --> 02:04:17.500
Here's your 20 rupees.

02:04:18.166 --> 02:04:19.500
Esaki!

02:04:19.875 --> 02:04:21.375
-Your money?
-No, thanks.

02:04:41.416 --> 02:04:43.333
Where is Rathinam's house?

02:04:43.583 --> 02:04:45.416
The third street down this road.

02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:58.375
Kill him only if we lose.

02:04:58.625 --> 02:05:00.750
If we win,
they will take care of him.

02:05:00.833 --> 02:05:02.208
No problem, brother.

02:05:02.583 --> 02:05:03.708
We will keep it low-key.

02:05:03.791 --> 02:05:05.041
No, make it loud.

02:05:05.791 --> 02:05:07.500
I want every villager to witness it.

02:05:07.583 --> 02:05:10.375
No one should consider
crossing us ever again.

02:05:10.833 --> 02:05:12.166
What do you want me to do?

02:05:12.291 --> 02:05:13.625
They are barbaric people!

02:05:13.708 --> 02:05:14.791
If I try to interfere,

02:05:14.875 --> 02:05:17.708
they'll say it's an internal issue.

02:05:21.625 --> 02:05:24.208
I'm just waiting for someone
to die, to step in.

02:05:35.291 --> 02:05:38.833

Oh, that's nothing!

All our problems are over.

02:06:18.916 --> 02:06:20.833
Look, I cast my vote.

02:06:21.416 --> 02:06:24.291
The villagers have started talking to me,
just like before.

02:06:24.375 --> 02:06:25.916
They also come to get haircuts!

02:06:26.041 --> 02:06:29.416
The only issue is that Esaki steals
the powder bottle occasionally!

02:06:34.791 --> 02:06:37.083
Side Burn, please forgive me.

02:06:37.166 --> 02:06:39.666
Why do you have a long face?

02:06:39.833 --> 02:06:42.000
It's your smile that
makes you the person you are.

Only one person can accompany
the candidate.

First up, Kallikulam.

I have no work either.

02:06:56.916 --> 02:06:57.791
Well…

02:06:57.875 --> 02:06:59.958
one word from you
gets new roads built.

02:07:00.041 --> 02:07:02.708
You can get street lamps installed
and proper water supply for all.

02:07:02.791 --> 02:07:04.750
Why can't you get
a meal for yourself?

02:07:07.083 --> 02:07:08.666
I got all that for my vote.

02:07:09.916 --> 02:07:11.583
I didn't earn it.

02:07:16.458 --> 02:07:17.583
Eat this.

02:07:24.583 --> 02:07:25.500
What is it?

02:07:25.583 --> 02:07:27.708
You want to earn your meal.
Is that all?

Take a good look.

I've asked the postal truck
to come here.

02:08:29.875 --> 02:08:31.833
Just sneak into it.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.708
If they stop us at the village border,
I will handle it.

02:08:34.875 --> 02:08:37.041
You can't be here
when the result is announced.

02:08:39.041 --> 02:08:40.333
It was my father's dream

02:08:40.416 --> 02:08:42.583
that I earn my own money
and open a salon in this village.

02:08:42.666 --> 02:08:44.166
So, I'm not leaving.

02:08:44.333 --> 02:08:45.916
Let them do what they want.

02:09:15.916 --> 02:09:18.208
-Aren't you a Southerner?
-Yes.

02:09:18.291 --> 02:09:20.083
Shut down your shop and go home.

02:09:21.625 --> 02:09:23.166
You shouldn't be here.

02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.666
Please leave,
at least for Side Burn's sake.

02:09:26.208 --> 02:09:27.333
Go.

02:09:33.791 --> 02:09:35.708
If you can, make him get an education.

02:09:36.625 --> 02:09:38.250
He can write his name, you know?

02:09:59.083 --> 02:10:00.708
Leave.
What are you looking at?

02:10:03.583 --> 02:10:09.500
<i>Rathinam is leading by 10 votes</i>
<i>in Soorangudi's local body elections.</i>

02:10:16.625 --> 02:10:18.250
-Yes?
-I hope you are ready.

02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:19.583
Yes.

02:10:19.666 --> 02:10:20.666
<i>Where is he?</i>

02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:22.041
I have him in sight.

02:10:48.625 --> 02:10:50.333
What are you looking at?

02:10:50.416 --> 02:10:51.583
Just go in.

02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:53.583
Let's not get involved in this.

02:10:58.750 --> 02:11:04.416
<i>Rathinam is leading by 12 votes</i>
<i>in Soorangudi's local body elections.</i>

02:11:05.250 --> 02:11:08.916
At least we can make a living
selling water cans.

02:11:09.541 --> 02:11:11.958
Those people have
even sold their bar off.

02:11:12.083 --> 02:11:14.000
How will they feed themselves?

02:11:14.208 --> 02:11:17.041
They will become barbers,
just like Mandela!

02:11:22.291 --> 02:11:24.166
Kill him right now!

02:11:24.250 --> 02:11:25.666
The result isn't out yet.

02:11:25.791 --> 02:11:27.083
Just do as I say!

02:11:27.250 --> 02:11:28.208
Okay.

02:11:28.791 --> 02:11:30.208
He has given the go-ahead.

02:11:46.291 --> 02:11:48.583
Don't you want to continue
living in this village?

02:11:48.791 --> 02:11:50.375
How many times must I tell you?

02:12:14.541 --> 02:12:16.250
I told you, you can't be here.

02:12:16.541 --> 02:12:19.416
Don't yell at her.
I asked her to bring me here.

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:22.125
Sir, I don't want anyone's help.

02:12:22.208 --> 02:12:23.958
Please leave.
I can save myself.

02:12:24.041 --> 02:12:27.458
Sir, I told you.
He won't listen to anyone.

02:12:27.541 --> 02:12:28.666
Let's go.

02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:30.458
Who is here to help you?

02:12:30.875 --> 02:12:31.708
What?

02:12:31.791 --> 02:12:33.041
I want a shave.

02:12:33.166 --> 02:12:34.333
A shave?

02:12:34.625 --> 02:12:35.666
Right now?

02:12:39.416 --> 02:12:40.250
Okay.

02:12:40.333 --> 02:12:42.083
-An old man?
-In a wheelchair.

02:12:42.333 --> 02:12:43.750
-That's my father.
-Your father?

02:12:44.333 --> 02:12:45.375
Let's do it another day?

02:12:45.458 --> 02:12:50.291
<i>Rathinam is maintaining his 12 vote lead</i>
<i>in Soorangudi's local body elections.</i>

02:12:50.375 --> 02:12:52.833
<i>We will conclude</i>
<i>the vote count shortly.</i>

02:12:56.250 --> 02:12:58.541
It doesn't matter
even if my father gets hurt.

02:12:58.916 --> 02:12:59.875
Kill him.

02:12:59.958 --> 02:13:01.041
Alright.

02:13:04.416 --> 02:13:05.583
Kill him.

02:13:12.083 --> 02:13:13.250
Mandela!

02:13:24.208 --> 02:13:26.458
My son needs a haircut.

02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:28.875
I just came here
to see if you were around.

02:13:33.625 --> 02:13:35.500
I can only do it after I shave him.

02:13:35.583 --> 02:13:37.500
That's okay.
I'll wait right here.

02:13:38.875 --> 02:13:42.166
Someone else just turned up
with an iron rod.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I don't care
how many people turn up.

02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:47.250
Just do away with him!

02:13:50.958 --> 02:13:52.083
Mandela!

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:55.541
Can you dye my mustache?

02:14:03.833 --> 02:14:05.000
Mandela!

02:14:05.875 --> 02:14:08.750
My grandma wants a haircut.

02:14:10.458 --> 02:14:13.083
Mandela, I need a haircut.

02:14:13.291 --> 02:14:15.666
Do as I say.
Just kill them all!

02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:17.041
The entire village is here!

02:14:17.125 --> 02:14:18.208
The entire village?

02:14:18.291 --> 02:14:19.833
I can't do this.
I am leaving.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.333
Get back here!

02:14:22.791 --> 02:14:23.916
What happened?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:24.833
Come on.

02:14:24.916 --> 02:14:25.833
What is it?

02:14:25.916 --> 02:14:28.333
Are you here for a haircut or a shave?

02:14:41.708 --> 02:14:43.375
Where are they going?

02:14:44.416 --> 02:14:45.541
Pull over.

02:14:45.625 --> 02:14:47.083

No, thanks.
